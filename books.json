{"books":[{"title":"A Living Nightmare","pages":["<p>Chapter ONE</p><p>I WAS IN THE BATHROOM at school, sitting down on the toilet, humming a song. I had my pants on. I'd come in near the end of English class, feeling sick. My teacher, Mr. Dalton, is great about things like that. He's smart and knows when you're faking and when you're being serious. He took one look at me when I raised my hand and said I was ill, then nodded his head and told me to go to the bathroom.</p><p>\"Throw up whatever's making you sick, Darren,\" he said, \"then get your behind back in here.\"</p><p>I wish every teacher was as understanding as Mr. Dalton.</p><p>In the end, I didn't get sick, but still felt queasy, so I stayed on the toilet. I heard the bell ring for the end of class and everybody came rushing out on their lunch break. I wanted to join them but knew Mr. Dalton would be angry if he saw me in the yard so soon. He doesn't get mad if you trick him but he goes quiet and won't speak to you for a while, and that's almost worse than being shouted at.</p><p>So, there I was, humming, watching my watch, waiting. Then I heard someone calling my name.</p><p>\"Darren! Hey, Darren! Have you fallen in or what?\"</p><p>I grinned. It was Steve Leopard, my best friend. Steve's real last name was Leonard, but everyone called him Steve Leopard. And not just because the names sound alike. Steve used to be what my mom calls \"a wild child.\" He raised hell wherever he went, got into fights, stole from stores. One day - he was still in a stroller - he found a sharp stick and prodded passing women with it (no prizes for guessing where he stuck it!).</p><p>He was feared and despised everywhere he went. But not by me. I've been his best friend since kindergarten, when we first met. My mom says I was drawn to his wildness, but I just thought he was a great guy to be with. He had a fierce temper and threw scary tantrums when he lost it, but I simply ran away when that happened and came back again once he'd calmed down.</p><p>Steve's reputation had softened over the years - his mom took him to see a lot of good counselors who taught him how to control himself but he was still a minor legend in the schoolyard and not someone you messed with, even if you were bigger and older than him.</p><p>\"Hey, Steve,\" I called back. \"I'm in here.\" I hit the door so he'd know which one I was behind.</p><p>He hurried over and I opened the door. He smiled when he saw me sitting down with my pants on. \"Did you puke?\" he asked.</p><p>\"No,\" I said.</p><p>\"Do you think you're gonna?\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\" I said. Then I leaned forward all of a sudden and made a sick noise. Bluurgh! But Steve Leopard knew me too well to be fooled.</p><p>\"Give my boots a polish while you're down there,\" he said, and laughed when I pretended to spit on his shoes and rub them with a sheet of toilet paper.</p><p>\"Did I miss anything in class?\" I asked, sitting up.</p><p>\"Nah,\" he said. \"The usual crap.\"</p><p>\"Did you do your history homework?\" I asked.</p><p>\"It doesn't have to be done until tomorrow, does it?\" he asked, getting worried. Steve's always forgetting about homework.</p><p>\"The day after tomorrow,\" I told him.</p><p>\"Oh,\" he said, relaxing. \"Even better. I thought...\"</p><p>He stopped and frowned. \"Hold on,\" he said. \"Today's Thursday. The day after tomorrow would be...\"</p><p>\"Got you!\" I yelled, punching him on the shoulder.</p><p>\"Ow!\" he shouted. \"That hurt.\" He rubbed his arm but I could tell he wasn't really hurt. \"Are you coming out?\" he asked then.</p><p>\"I thought I'd stay in here and admire the view,\" I said, leaning back on the toilet seat.</p><p>\"Quit joking,\" he said. \"We were down five-one when I came in. We're probably six or seven down now. We need you.\" He was talking about soccer. We play a game every lunchtime. My team normally wins but we'd lost a lot of our best players. Dave Morgan broke his leg. Sam White transferred to another school when his family moved. And Danny Curtain had stopped playing soccer in order to spend lunch hanging out with Sheila Leigh, the girl he likes. Idiot!</p><p>I'm our best forward. There are better defenders and midfielders, and Tommy Jones is the best goalkeeper in the whole school. But I'm the only one who can stand up front and score four or five times a day without fail.</p><p>\"Okay,\" I said, standing. \"I'll save you. I've scored a hat trick every day this week. It would be a pity to stop now.\"</p><p>We passed the older guys smoking around the sinks as usual and hurried to my locker so I could change into my cleats. I used to have a great pair, which I won in a writing competition. But the laces snapped a few months ago and the rubber along the sides started to fall off. And then my feet grew! The pair I have now are okay, but they're not the same.</p><p>We were down eight-three when I got on the field. It wasn't a real field, just a long stretch of grass with painted goalposts at either end. Whoever painted them was a total idiot. He put the crossbar too high at one end and too low at the other!</p><p>\"Never fear, Hotshot Shan is here!\" I shouted as I ran onto the field. A lot of players laughed or groaned, but I could see my teammates picking up and our opponents growing worried.</p><p>I made a great start and scored two goals inside a minute. It looked like we might come back to draw or win. But time ran out. If I'd arrived earlier we'd have been okay, but the bell rang just as I was hitting my stride, so we lost nine-seven.</p><p>As we were leaving the field, Alan Morris ran toward us, panting and red-faced. They're my three best friends: Steve Leopard, Tommy Jones, and Alan Morris. We must be the weirdest four people in the whole world, because only one of us Steve has a nickname.</p><p>\"Look what I found!\" Alan yelled, waving a soggy piece of paper around under our noses.</p><p>\"What is it?\" Tommy asked, trying to grab it.</p><p>\"It's...\" Alan began, but stopped when Mr. Dalton shouted at us.</p><p>\"You four! Inside!\" he roared.</p><p>\"We're coming, Mr. Dalton!\" Steve roared back. Steve is Mr. Dalton's favorite and gets away with stuff that the rest of us couldn't do. Like when he uses swearwords sometimes in his stories. If I put in some of the words Steve has, I'd have been kicked out long ago.</p><p>But Mr. Dalton has a soft spot for Steve, because he's special. Sometimes he's brilliant in class and gets everything right, while other times he can't even spell his own name. Mr. Dalton says he's somewhat of an idiot savant, which mean he's a stupid genius!</p>","<p>Anyway, even though he's Mr. Dalton's pet, not even Steve can get away with showing up late for class. So whatever Alan had, it would have to wait. We trudged back to class, sweaty and tired after the game, and began our next lesson.</p><p>Little did I know that Alan's mysterious piece of paper was to change my life forever. For the worse!</p><p>Chapter TWO</p><p>WE HAD MR. DALTON again after lunch, for history. We were studying World War II. I wasn't too excited about it, but Steve thought it was great. He loved anything to do with killing and war. He often said he wanted to be a soldier of fortune one who fights for money when he grew up. And he meant it!</p><p>We had math after history, and incredibly Mr. Dalton for a third time! Our usual math teacher was out sick, so others had been filling in for him as best they could all day.</p><p>Steve was in seventh heaven. His favorite teacher, three classes in a row! It was the first time we'd had Mr. Dalton for math, so Steve started showing off, telling him where we were in the book, explaining some of the trickier problems as though speaking to a child. Mr. Dalton didn't mind. He was used to Steve and knew exactly how to handle him.</p><p>Normally Mr. Dalton runs a tight ship his classes are fun but we always come out of them having learned something but he wasn't very good at math. He tried hard but we could tell he was in over his head, and while he was busy trying to come to grips with things his head buried in the math book, Steve by his side making ?helpful? suggestions the rest of us began to fidget and whisper to each other and pass notes around.</p><p>I sent a note to Alan, asking to see the mysterious piece of paper he'd brought in. He refused at first to pass it around, but I kept sending notes and finally he gave in. Tommy sits just two seats over from him, so he got it first. He opened it up and began studying it. His face lit up while he was reading and his jaw slowly dropped. When he passed it on to me having read it three times I soon saw why.</p><p>It was a flyer, an advertising pamphlet for some sort of traveling circus. There was a picture of a wolf's head at the top. The wolf had its mouth open and saliva was dripping from its teeth. At the bottom were pictures of a spider and a snake, and they looked vicious, too.</p><p>Just beneath the wolf, in big red capital letters, were the words:</p><p>CIRQUE DU FREAK</p><p>Underneath that, in smaller writing:</p><p>FOR ONE WEEK ONLY CIRQUE DU FREAK!!</p><p>SEE:</p><p>SIVE AND SEERSA THE TWISTING TWINS!</p><p>THE SNAKE-BOY! THE WOLF-MAN! GERTHA TEETH!</p><p>LARTEN CREPSLEY AND HIS PERFORMING SPIDER</p><p>MADAM OCTA! ALEXANDER RIBS! THE BEARDED LADY!</p><p>HANS HANDS! RHAMUS TWOBELLIES WORLD'S FATTEST MAN!</p><p>Beneath all that was an address where you could buy tickets and find out where the show was playing. And right at the bottom, just above the pictures of the snake and spider:</p><p>NOT FOR THE FAINTHEARTED! SOME RESTRICTIONS APPLY!</p><p>\"Cirque Du Freak?\" I muttered softly to myself. Cirque was French for circus...Circus of Freaks! Was this a freak show?! It looked like it.</p><p>I began reading the flyer again, immersed in the drawings and descriptions of the performers. In fact, I was so immersed, I forgot about Mr. Dalton. I only remembered him when I realized the room was silent. I looked up and saw Steve standing alone at the head of the class. He stuck out his tongue at me and grinned. Feeling the hairs on the back of my neck prickle, I stared over my shoulder and there was Mr. Dalton, standing behind me, reading the flyer, lips tight.</p><p>\"What is this?\" he snapped, snatching the paper from my hands.</p><p>\"It's an advertisement, sir,\" I answered.</p><p>\"Where'd you get it?\" he asked. He looked really angry. I'd never seen him this worked up. \"Where'd you get it?\" he asked again.</p><p>I licked my lips nervously. I didn't know how to answer. I wasn't going to tell on Alan and I knew he wouldn't own up by himself: even Alan's best friends know he's not the bravest in the world but my mind was stuck in low gear and I couldn't think of a reasonable lie. Luckily, Steve stepped in.</p><p>\"Mr. Dalton, it's mine,\" he said.</p><p>\"Yours?\" Mr. Dalton blinked slowly.</p><p>\"I found it near the bus stop, sir,\" Steve said. \"Some old guy threw it away. I thought it looked interesting, so I picked it up. I was going to ask you about it later, at the end of class.\"</p><p>\"Oh.\" Mr. Dalton tried not to look flattered but I could tell he was. \"That's different. Nothing wrong with an inquisitive mind. Sit down, Steve.\" Steve sat. Mr. Dalton stuck a thumbtack on the flyer and pinned it to the bulletin board.</p><p>\"Long ago,\" he said, tapping the flyer, \"there used to be real freak shows. Greedy con men crammed malformed people in cages and...\"</p><p>\"Sir, what's malformed mean?\" somebody asked.</p><p>\"Someone who doesn't look ordinary,\" Mr. Dalton said. \"A person with three arms or two noses; somebody with no legs; somebody very short or very tall. The con men put these poor people who were no different from you or me, except in looks on display and called them freaks. They charged the public to stare at them, and invited them to laugh and tease. They treated the so-called freaks like animals. Paid them little, beat them, dressed them in rags, never allowed them to wash.\"</p><p>\"That's cruel,\" Delaina Price a girl near the front said.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he agreed. \"Freak shows were cruel, monstrous creations. That's why I got angry when I saw this.\" He tore down the flyer. \"They were banned years ago, but every so often you'll hear a rumor that they're still going strong.\"</p><p>\"Do you think the Cirque Du Freak is a real freak show?\" I asked.</p><p>Mr. Dalton studied the flyer again, then shook his head.</p><p>\"I doubt it,\" he said. \"Probably just a cruel hoax. Still,\" he added, \"if it was real, I hope nobody here would dream of going.\"</p><p>\"Oh, no, sir,\" we all said quickly.</p><p>\"Because freak shows were terrible,\" he said. \"They pretended to be like proper circuses but they were cesspits of evil. Anybody who went to one would be just as bad as the people running it.\"</p><p>\"You'd have to be really twisted to want to go to one of those,\" Steve agreed. And then he looked at me, winked, and mouthed the words: \"We're going!\"</p><p>Chapter THREE</p><p>STEVE PERSUADED MR. DALTON to let him keep the flyer. He said he wanted it for his bedroom wall. Mr. Dalton wasn't going to give it to him but then changed his mind. He cut off the address at the bottom before handing it over.</p>","<p>After school, the four of us me, Steve, Alan Morris, and Tommy Jones met outside and studied the glossy flyer.</p><p>\"It's got to be a fake,\" I said.</p><p>\"Why?\" Alan asked.</p><p>\"They don't allow freak shows anymore,\" I told him. \"Wolf-men and snake-boys were outlawed years ago. Mr. Dalton said so.\"</p><p>\"It's not a fake,\" Alan insisted.</p><p>\"Where'd you get it?\" Tommy asked.</p><p>\"I stole it,\" Alan said softly. \"It belongs to my big brother.\" Alan's big brother was Tony Morris, who used to be the school's biggest bully until he got thrown out. He's huge and mean and ugly.</p><p>\"You stole from Tony?!?\" I gasped. \"Have you got a death wish?\"</p><p>\"He won't know it was me,\" Alan said. \"He had it in a pair of pants that my mother threw in the washing machine. I stuck a blank piece of paper in when I took this out. He'll think the ink got washed off.\"</p><p>\"Smart,\" Steve said.</p><p>\"Where did Tony get it?\" I asked.</p><p>\"There was a guy passing them out in an alley,\" Alan said. \"One of the circus performers, a Mr. Crepsley.\"</p><p>\"The one with the spider?\" Tommy asked.</p><p>\"Yeah,\" Alan answered, \"only he didn't have the spider with him. It was night and Tony was on his way back from a bar.\" Tony's not old enough to get served in bars, but hangs around with older guys who buy drinks for him. \"Mr. Crepsley handed the paper to Tony and told him they're a traveling freak show who put on secret performances in towns and cities across the world. He said you had to have a flyer to buy tickets and they only give them to people they trust. You're not supposed to tell anyone else about the show. I only found out because Tony was in high spirits the way he gets when he drinks and couldn't keep his mouth shut.\"</p><p>\"How much are the tickets?\" Steve asked.</p><p>\"Twenty-three dollars each,\" Alan said.</p><p>\"Twenty-three dollars!\" we all shouted.</p><p>\"Nobody's going to pay twenty-three bucks to see a bunch of freaks!\" Steve snorted.</p><p>\"I would,\" I said.</p><p>\"Me, too,\" Tommy agreed.</p><p>\"And me,\" Alan added.</p><p>\"Sure,\" Steve said, \"but we don't have twenty-three bucks to throw away. So it's academic, isn't it?\"</p><p>\"What does academic mean?\" Alan asked.</p><p>\"It means we can't afford the tickets, so it doesn't matter if we would buy them or not,\" Steve explained. \"It's easy to say you would buy something if you know you can't.\"</p><p>\"I'd love to go,\" Tommy said sadly. \"It sounds great.\" He studied the picture again.</p><p>\"Mr. Dalton didn't think too much of it,\" Alan said.</p><p>\"That's what I mean,\" Tommy said. \"If Dalton doesn't like it, it must be super. Anything that adults hate is normally awesome.\"</p><p>\"Are we sure we don't have enough?\" I asked. \"Maybe they have discounts for children.\"</p><p>\"I don't think children are allowed in,\" Alan said, but he told me how much he had anyway. \"Eight-fifty.\"</p><p>\"I've got eighteen dollars exactly,\" Steve said.</p><p>\"I have ten dollars and forty cents,\" Tommy said.</p><p>\"And I have twelve dollars and thirty cents,\" I told them. \"That's more than forty-nine dollars in all,\" I said, adding it up in my head. \"We get our allowance tomorrow. If we pool our...\"</p><p>\"But the tickets are nearly sold out,\" Alan interrupted. \"The first show was yesterday. It finishes Tuesday. If we go, it'll have to be tomorrow night or Saturday, because our parents won't let us out any other night. The guy who gave Tony the flyer said the tickets for both those nights were almost gone. We'd have to buy them tonight.\"</p><p>\"Well, so much for that,\" I said, putting on a brave face.</p><p>\"Maybe not,\" Steve said. \"My mom keeps a wad of money in a jar at home. I could borrow some and put it back when we get our allowance...\"</p><p>\"You mean steal?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I mean borrow,\" he snapped. \"It's only stealing if you don't put it back. What do you say?\"</p><p>\"How would we get the tickets?\" Tommy asked. \"It's a school night. We wouldn't be let out.\"</p><p>\"I can sneak out,\" Steve said. \"I'll buy them.\"</p><p>\"But Mr. Dalton snipped off the address,\" I reminded him. \"How will you know where to go?\"</p><p>\"I memorized it.\" He grinned. \"Now, are we gonna stand here all night making up excuses, or are we gonna go for it?\"</p><p>We looked at each other, then one by one nodded silently.</p><p>\"Right,\" Steve said. \"We hurry home, grab our money, and meet back here. Tell your parents you forgot a book or something. We'll lump the money together and I'll add the rest from the pot at home.\"</p><p>\"What if you can't steal I mean, 'borrow, the money?\" I asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \"Then the deal's off. But we won't know unless we try. Now hurry!\"</p><p>With that, he sprinted away. Moments later, making up our minds, Tommy, Alan, and I ran, too.</p><p>Chapter FOUR</p><p>THE FREAK SHOW WAS all I could think about that night. I tried forgetting it but couldn't, not even when I was watching my favorite TV shows. It sounded so weird: a snake-boy, a wolf-man, a performing spider. I was especially excited by the spider.</p><p>Mom and Dad didn't notice anything was up, but Annie did. Annie is my younger sister. She can be sort of annoying but most of the time she's cool. She doesn't run to Mom telling on me if I misbehave, and she knows how to keep a secret.</p><p>\"What's wrong with you?\" she asked after dinner. We were alone in the kitchen, washing the dishes.</p><p>\"Nothing's wrong,\" I said.</p><p>\"Yes there is,\" she said. \"You've been acting weird all night.\"</p><p>I knew she'd keep asking until she got the truth, so I told her about the freak show.</p><p>\"It sounds great,\" she agreed, \"but there's no way you'd get in.\"</p><p>\"Why not? \"I asked.</p><p>\"I bet they don't let children in. It sounds like a grown-up kind of show.\"</p><p>\"They probably wouldn't let a brat like you in,\" I said nastily, \"but me and the others would be okay.\" That upset her, so I apologized. \"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"I didn't mean that. I'm just annoyed because you're probably right. Annie, I'd give anything to go!\"</p>","<p>\"I've got a makeup kit I could lend you,\" she said. \"You can draw on wrinkles and stuff. It'd make you look older.\"</p><p>I smiled and gave her a big hug, which is something I don't do very often. \"Thanks, sis,\" I said, \"but it's okay. If we get in, we get in. If we don't, we don't.\"</p><p>We didn't say much after that. We finished drying and hurried into the TV room. Dad got home a few minutes later. He works on building sites all over the place, so he's often late. He's grumpy sometimes but was in a good mood that night and swung Annie around in a circle.</p><p>\"Anything exciting happen today?\" he asked, after he'd said hello to Mom and given her a kiss.</p><p>\"I scored another hat trick at lunch,\" I told him.</p><p>\"Really?\" he said. \"That's great. Well done.\"</p><p>We turned the TV down while Dad was eating. He likes peace and quiet when he eats, and often asks us questions or tells us about his day at work.</p><p>Later, Mom went to her room to work on her stamp albums. She's a serious stamp collector. I used to collect, too, when I was younger and more easily amused.</p><p>I popped up fo see if she had any new stamps with exotic animals or spiders on them. She didn't. While I was there, I asked her about freak shows.</p><p>\"Mom,\" I said, \"have you ever been to a freak show?\"</p><p>\"A what?\" she asked, concentrating on the stamps.</p><p>\"A freak show,\" I repeated. \"With bearded ladies and wolf-men and snake-boys.\"</p><p>She looked up at me and blinked. \"A snake-boy?\" she asked. \"What on Earth is a snake-boy?\"</p><p>\"It's a...\" I stopped when I realized I didn't know. \"Well, that doesn't matter,\" I said. \"Have you ever been to one?\"</p><p>She shook her head. \"No. They're illegal.\"</p><p>\"If they weren't,\" I said, \"and one came to town, would you go?\"</p><p>\"No,\" she said, shivering. \"Those sorts of things frighten me. Besides, I don't think it would be fair to the people in the show.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I asked.</p><p>\"How would you like it,\" she said, \"if you were stuck in a cage for people to look at?\"</p><p>\"I'm not a freak!\" I said huffily.</p><p>\"I know.\" She laughed and kissed my forehead. \"You're my little angel.\"</p><p>\"Mom, don't!\" I grumbled, wiping my forehead with my hand.</p><p>\"Silly.\" She smiled. \"But imagine you had two heads or four arms, and somebody stuck you on display for people to make fun of. You wouldn't like that, would you?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said, shuffling my feet.</p><p>\"Anyway, what's all this about a freak show?\" she asked. \"Have you been staying up late, watching horror films?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said.</p><p>\"Because you know your dad doesn't like you watching...\"</p><p>\"I wasn't staying up late, okay?\" I shouted. It's really annoying when parents don't listen.</p><p>\"Okay, Mister Grumpy,\" she said. \"No need to shout. If you don't like my company, go downstairs and help your father weed the garden.\"</p><p>I didn't want to go, but Mom was upset that I'd shouted at her, so I left and went down to the kitchen. Dad was coming in from the back and spotted me.</p><p>\"So this is where you've been hiding.\" He chuckled. \"Too busy to help the old man tonight?\"</p><p>\"I was on my way,\" I told him.</p><p>\"Too late,\" he said, taking off his workboots. \"I'm finished.\"</p><p>I watched him putting on his slippers. He has huge feet. He wears size twelve shoes! When I was younger, he used to stand me on his feet and walk me around. It was like being on two long skateboards.</p><p>\"What are you doing now?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Writing,\" he said. My dad has pen pals all over the world, in America, Australia, Russia, and China. He says he likes to keep in touch with his global neighbors, though I think it's just an excuse to go into his study for a nap!</p><p>Annie was playing with dolls and stuff. I asked if she wanted to come to my room for a game of tennis using a sock for a ball and shoes for rackets, but she was too busy arranging her dolls for a pretend picnic.</p><p>I went to my room and dragged down my comic books. I have a bunch of cool comic books Superman, Batman, Spiderman, and Spawn. Spawn's my favorite. He's a superhero who used to be a demon in hell. Some of the Spawn comics are pretty scary, but that's why I love them.</p><p>I spent the rest of the night reading comic books and putting them in order. I used to swap with Tommy, who has a huge collection, but he kept spilling drinks on the covers and crumbs between the pages, so I stopped.</p><p>Most nights I go to bed by ten, but Mom and Dad forgot about me, and I stayed up until nearly ten-thirty. Then Dad saw the light in my room and came up. He pretended to be angry but he wasn't really. Dad doesn't mind too much if I stay up late. Mom's the one who nags me about that.</p><p>\"Bed,\" he said, \"or I'll never be able to wake you in the morning.\"</p><p>\"Just a minute, Dad,\" I told him, \"while I put my comics away and brush my teeth.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" he said, \"but make it quick.\"</p><p>I stuck the comics into their box and stuffed it back up on the shelf over my bed.</p><p>I put on my pajamas and went to brush my teeth. I took my time, brushing slowly, and it was almost eleven when I got into bed. I lay back, smiling. I felt very tired and knew I'd fall asleep in a couple of seconds. The last thing I thought about was the Cirque Du Freak. I wondered what a snake-boy looked like, and how long the bearded lady's beard was, and what Hans Hands and Gertha Teeth did. Most of all, I dreamed about the spider.</p><p>Chapter FIVE</p><p>THE NEXT MORNING, TOMMY, Alan, and me waited outside the gates for Steve, but there was no sign of him by the time the bell rang for class, so we had to go in.</p><p>\"I bet he's hiding,\" Tommy said. \"He couldn't get the tickets and now he doesn't want to face us.\"</p><p>\"Steve's not like that,\" I said.</p><p>\"I hope he brings the flyer back,\" Alan said. \"Even if we can't go, I'd like to have the flyer. I'd stick it up over my bed and...\"</p><p>\"You couldn't stick it up, stupid!\" Tommy laughed.</p><p>\"Why not? \"Alan asked.</p><p>\"Because Tony would see it,\" I told him.</p><p>\"Oh yeah,\" Alan said glumly.</p>","<p>I was miserable in class. We had geography first, and every time Mrs. Quinn asked me a question, I got it wrong. Normally geography's my best subject, because I know so much about it from when I used to collect stamps.</p><p>\"Had a late night, Darren?\" she asked when I got my fifth question wrong.</p><p>\"No, Mrs. Quinn,\" I lied.</p><p>\"I think you did.\" She smiled. \"There are more bags under your eyes than in the local supermarket!\" Everybody laughed at that Mrs. Quinn didn't crack jokes very often and I did, too, even though I was the butt of the joke.</p><p>The morning dragged, the way it does when you feel let down or disappointed. I spent the time imagining the freak show. I made-believe I was one of the freaks, and the owner of the circus was a nasty guy who whipped everybody, even when they got stuff right. All the freaks hated him, but he was so big and mean, nobody said anything. Until one day he whipped me once too often, and I turned into a wolf and bit his head off! Everybody cheered and I was made the new owner.</p><p>It was a pretty good daydream.</p><p>Then, a few minutes before lunch, the door opened and guess who walked in? Steve! His mother was behind him and she said something to Mrs. Quinn, who nodded and smiled. Then Mrs. Leonard left and Steve strolled over to his seat and sat down.</p><p>\"Where were you?\" I asked in a furious whisper.</p><p>\"At the dentist's,\" he said. \"I forgot to tell you I was going.\"</p><p>\"What about...\"</p><p>\"That's enough, Darren,\" Mrs. Quinn said. I shut up instantly.</p><p>At recess, Tommy, Alan, and I almost smothered Steve. We were shouting and pulling at him at the same time.</p><p>\"Did you get the tickets?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Were you really at the dentist's?\" Tommy wanted to know.</p><p>\"Where's my flyer?\" Alan asked.</p><p>\"Patience, boys, patience,\" Steve said, pushing us away and laughing. \"Good things come to those who wait.\"</p><p>\"Come on, Steve, don't mess around with us,\" I told him. \"Did you get them or not?\"</p><p>\"Yes and no,\" he said.</p><p>\"What does that mean?\" Tommy snorted.</p><p>\"It means I have some good news, some bad news, and some crazy news,\" he said. \"Which do you want to hear first?\"</p><p>\"Crazy news?\" I asked, puzzled.</p><p>Steve pulled us off to one side of the yard, checked to make sure no one was around, then began speaking in a whisper.</p><p>\"I got the money,\" he said, \"and sneaked out at seven o'clock, when Mom was on the phone. I hurried across town to the ticket booth, but do you know who was there when I arrived?\"</p><p>\"Who?\" we asked.</p><p>\"Mr. Dalton!\" he said. \"He was there with a couple of policemen. They were dragging a small guy out of the booth it was only a small shed, really when suddenly there was this huge bang and a big cloud of smoke covered them all. When it cleared, the small guy had disappeared.\"</p><p>\"What did Mr. Dalton and the police do?\" Alan asked.</p><p>\"Examined the shed, looked around a bit, then left.\"</p><p>\"They didn't see you?\" Tommy asked.</p><p>\"No,\" Steve said. \"I was well hidden.\"</p><p>\"So you didn't get the tickets,\" I said sadly.</p><p>\"I didn't say that,\" he contradicted me.</p><p>\"You got them?\" I gasped.</p><p>\"I turned to leave,\" he said, \"and found the small guy behind me. He was tiny, and dressed in a long cloak that covered him from head to toe. He spotted the flyer in my hand, took it, and held out the tickets. I handed over the money and...\"</p><p>\"You got them!\" we roared delightedly.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he beamed. Then his face fell. \"But there was a catch. I told you there was bad news, remember?\"</p><p>\"What is it?\" I asked, thinking he'd lost them.</p><p>\"He only sold me two,\" Steve said. \"I had the money for four, but he wouldn't take it. He didn't say anything, just tapped the part on the flyer about 'some restrictions, then handed me a card that said the Cirque Du Freak only sold two tickets per flyer. I offered him extra money I had almost a hundred dollars total but he wouldn't accept it.\"</p><p>\"He only sold you two tickets?\" Tommy asked, dismayed.</p><p>\"But that means...\" Alan began.</p><p>\"...Only two of us can go,\" Steve finished. He looked around at us grimly. \"Two of us will have to stay at home.\"</p><p>Chapter SIX</p><p>IT WAS FRIDAY AFTERNOON, the end of the school week, the start of the weekend, and everybody was laughing and running home as quickly as they could, delighted to be free. Except a certain miserable foursome who hung around the schoolyard, looking like the end of the world had arrived. Their names? Steve Leonard, Tommy Jones, Alan Morris, and me, Darren Shan.</p><p>\"It's not fair,\" Alan moaned. \"Who ever heard of a circus only letting you buy two tickets? It's stupid!\"</p><p>We all agreed with him, but there was nothing we could do about it but stand around kicking the ground with our feet, looking bummed out.</p><p>Finally, Alan asked the question that was on everybody's mind.</p><p>\"So, who gets the tickets?\"</p><p>We looked at each other and shook our heads uncertainly.</p><p>\"Well, Steve has to get one,\" I said. \"He put in more money than the rest of us, and he went to buy them, so he has to get one, agreed?\"</p><p>\"Agreed,\" Tommy said.</p><p>\"Agreed,\" Alan said. I think he would have argued about it, except he knew he wouldn't win.</p><p>Steve smiled and took one of the tickets. \"Who goes with me?\" he asked.</p><p>\"I brought in the flyer,\" Alan said quickly.</p><p>\"Forget that!\" I told him. \"Steve should get to choose.\"</p><p>\"Not on your life!\" Tommy laughed. \"You're his best friend. If we let him pick, he'll pick you. I say we fight for it. I have boxing gloves at home.\"</p><p>\"No way!\" Alan squeaked. He's small and never gets into fights.</p><p>\"I don't want to fight either,\" I said. I'm no coward but I knew I wouldn't stand a chance against Tommy. His dad taught him how to box and they have their own punching bag. He would have floored me in the first round.</p><p>\"Let's pick straws for it,\" I said, but Tommy didn't want to. He has terrible luck and never wins anything like that.</p><p>We argued about it a bit more, until Steve came up with an idea. \"I know what to do,\" he said, opening his school bag. He tore two sheets of paper out of a notebook and, using his ruler, carefully cut them into small pieces, each one roughly the same size as the ticket. Then he got his empty lunch bag and dumped the paper inside.</p>","<p>\"Here's how it works,\" he said, holding up the second ticket. \"I put this in, squeeze the bag shut, and shake it around, okay?\" We nodded. \"You stand side by side and I'll throw the pieces of paper over your heads. Whoever gets the ticket wins. Me and the winner will give the other two their money back when we can afford it. Is that fair enough, or does somebody have a better idea?\"</p><p>\"Sounds good to me,\" I said.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" Alan grumbled. \"I'm the youngest. I can't jump as high as...\"</p><p>\"Quit yapping,\" Tommy said. \"I'm the smallest, and I don't mind. Besides, the ticket might come out on the bottom of the pile, float down low, and be in just the right place for the shortest person.</p><p>\"All right,\" Alan said. \"But no shoving.\"</p><p>\"Agreed,\" I said. \"No rough stuff.\"</p><p>\"Agreed.\" Tommy nodded.</p><p>Steve squeezed the bag and gave it a good long shake. \"Get ready,\" he told us.</p><p>We stood back from Steve and lined up in a row. Tommy and Alan were side by side, but I kept out of the way so I'd have room to swing both arms.</p><p>\"Okay,\" Steve said. \"I'll throw everything in the air on the count of three. All set?\" We nodded. \"One,\" Steve said, and I saw Alan wiping sweat from around his eyes. \"Two,\" Steve said, and Tommy's fingers twitched. \"Three!\" Steve yelled, and he jerked open the bag and tossed the paper high up into the air.</p><p>A breeze came along and blew the pieces of paper straight at us. Tommy and Alan started yelling and grabbing wildly. It was impossible to see the ticket in among the scraps of paper.</p><p>I was about to start grabbing, when all of a sudden I got an urge to do something strange. It sounds crazy, but I've always believed in following an urge or a hunch.</p><p>So what I did was, I shut my eyes, stuck out my hands like a blind man, and waited for something magical to happen.</p><p>As I'm sure you know, usually when you try something you've seen in a movie, it doesn't work. Like if you try doing a wheelie with your bike, or making your skateboard jump up in the air. But every once in a while, when you least expect it, something clicks.</p><p>For a second I felt paper blowing by my hands. I was going to grab at it but something told me it wasn't time. Then, a second later, a voice inside me yelled, \"NOW!\"</p><p>I closed my hands really fast.</p><p>The wind died down and the pieces of paper drifted to the ground. I opened my eyes and saw Alan and Tommy down on their knees, searching for the ticket.</p><p>\"It's not here!\" Tommy said.</p><p>\"I can't find it anywhere!\" Alan shouted.</p><p>They stopped searching and looked up at me. I hadn't moved. I was standing stills my hands closed tight.</p><p>\"What's in your hands, Darren?\" Steve asked softly.</p><p>I stared at him, unable to answer. It was like I was in a dream, where I couldn't move or speak.</p><p>\"He doesn't have it,\" Tommy said. \"He can't have. He had his eyes shut.\"</p><p>\"Maybe so,\" Steve said, \"but there's something in those fists of his.\"</p><p>\"Open them,\" Alan said, giving me a shove. \"Let's see what you're hiding.\"</p><p>I looked at Alan, then Tommy, then Steve. And then, very slowly, I opened my right fist.</p><p>There was nothing there.</p><p>My heart and stomach dropped. Alan smiled and Tommy started looking down at the ground again, trying to find the missing ticket.</p><p>\"What about the other hand?\" Steve asked.</p><p>I gazed down at my left fist. I'd almost forgotten about that one! Slowly, even slower than the first time, I opened it.</p><p>There was a piece of green paper smack-dab in the middle of my hand, but it was lying facedown, and since there was nothing on its back, I had to turn it over, just to be sure. And there it was, in red and blue letters, the magical name:</p><p>CIRQUE DU FREAK.</p><p>I had it. The ticket was mine. I was going to the freak show with Steve. \"YEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!\" I screamed, and punched the air with my fist. I'd won!</p><p>Chapter SEVEN</p><p>THE TICKETS WERE FOR the Saturday show, which was just as well, since it gave me a chance to talk to my parents and ask if I could stay over at Steve's Saturday night.</p><p>I didn't tell them about the freak show, because I knew they would say no if they knew about it. I felt bad about not telling the whole truth, but at the same time, I hadn't really told a lie: all I'd done was keep my mouth shut.</p><p>Saturday couldn't go quickly enough for me. I tried keeping busy, because that's how you make time pass without noticing, but I kept thinking about the Cirque Du Freak and wishing it was time to go. I was pretty grumpy, which was odd for me on a Saturday, and Mom was glad to see me go when it was time to leave for Steve's.</p><p>Annie knew I was going to the freak show and asked me to bring her back something, a photo if possible, but I told her cameras weren't allowed (it said so on the ticket) and I didn't have enough money for a T-shirt. I told her I'd buy her a pin if they had them, or a poster, but she'd have to keep it hidden and not tell Mom and Dad where she got it if they found it.</p><p>Dad dropped me off at Steve's at six o'clock. He asked what time I wanted to be picked up in the morning. I told him noon if that was okay.</p><p>\"Don't watch horror movies, okay?\" he said before he left. \"I don't want you coming home with nightmares.\"</p><p>\"Oh, Dad!\" I groaned. \"Everyone in my class watches horror movies.\"</p><p>\"Listen,\" he said, \"I don't mind an old black-and-white film, or one of the less scary Dracula movies, but none of these nasty new ones, okay?\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" I promised.</p><p>\"Good man,\" he said, and drove off.</p><p>I hurried up to the house and rang the doorbell four times, which was my secret signal to Steve. He must have been standing just inside, because he opened the door right away and dragged me in.</p><p>\"About time,\" he growled, then pointed to the stairs. \"See that hill?\" he asked, speaking like a soldier in a war film.</p><p>\"Yes, sir,\" I said, clicking my heels together.</p><p>\"We have to take it by dawn.\"</p><p>\"Are we using rifles or machine guns, sir?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Are you crazy?\" he barked. \"We'd never be able to carry a machine gun through all that mud.\" He nodded at the carpet.</p><p>\"Rifles it is, sir,\" I agreed.</p>","<p>\"And if we're taken,\" he warned me, \"save the last bullet for yourself.\"</p><p>We started up the stairs like a couple of soldiers, firing imaginary guns at imaginary enemies. It was childish, but great fun. Steve ?lost? a leg on the way and I had to help him to the top. \"You might have taken my leg,\" he shouted from the top of the stairs, \"and you might take my life, but you'll never take my country!\"</p><p>It was a stirring speech. At least, it stirred Mrs. Leonard, who came up from the downstairs living room to see what the racket was. She smiled when she saw me and asked if I wanted anything to eat or drink. I didn't. Steve said he'd like some caviar and champagne, but it wasn't funny the way he said it, and I didn't laugh.</p><p>Steve doesn't get along with his mom. He lives alone with her his dad left when Steve was very young and they're always arguing and shouting. I don't know why. I've never asked him. There are certain things you don't discuss with your friends if you're boys. Girls can talk about stuff like that, but if you're a boy you have to talk about computers, soccer, war, and so on. Parents aren't cool.</p><p>\"How will we sneak out tonight?\" I asked in a whisper as Steve's mom went back into the living room.</p><p>\"It's okay,\" Steve said. \"She's going out.\" He often called her she instead of Mom. \"She'll think we're in bed when she gets back.\"</p><p>\"What if she checks?\"</p><p>Steve laughed nastily. \"Enter my room without being asked? She wouldn't dare.\"</p><p>I didn't like Steve when he talked like that, but I said nothing in case he went into one of his moods. I didn't want to do anything that might spoil the show.</p><p>Steve dragged out some of his horror comics and we read them out loud. Steve has great comic books, which are only meant for adults. My mom and dad would hit the roof if they knew about them!</p><p>Steve also has a bunch of old magazines and books about monsters and vampires and werewolves and ghosts.</p><p>\"Does a stake have to be made out of wood?\" I asked when I'd finished reading a Dracula comic.</p><p>\"No,\" he said. \"It can be metal or ivory, even plastic, as long as it's hard enough to go right through the heart.\"</p><p>\"And that will kill a vampire?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Every time,\" he said.</p><p>I frowned. \"But you told me you have to cut off their heads and stuff them with garlic and throw them in a river.\"</p><p>\"Some books say you have to,\" he agreed. \"But that's to make sure you kill the vampire's spirit as well as its body, so it can't come back as a ghost.\"</p><p>\"Can a vampire come back as a ghost?\" I asked, eyes wide.</p><p>\"Probably not,\" Steve said. \"But if you had the time, and wanted to make sure, cutting off the head and getting rid of it would be worth doing. You don't want to take any chances with vampires, do you?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said, shivering. \"What about werewolves? Do you need silver bullets to kill them?\"</p><p>\"I don't think so,\" Steve said. \"I think normal bullets can do the job. You might have to use lots of them, but they should work.\"</p><p>Steve knows everything there is to know about horror facts. He's read every sort of horror book there is. He says every story has at least some truth in it, even if most are made up.</p><p>\"Do you think the wolf-man at the Cirque Du Freak is a werewolf?\" I asked.</p><p>Steve shook his head. \"From what I've read,\" he said, \"the wolf-men in freak shows are normally just very hairy guys. Some of them are more like animals than people, and eat live chickens and stuff, but they're not werewolves. A werewolf would be no good in a show, because it can only turn into a wolf when there's a full moon. Every other night, it would be a normal guy.\"</p><p>\"Oh,\" I said. \"What about the snake-boy? Do you...\"</p><p>\"Hey,\" he laughed, \"save the questions for later. The shows long ago were terrible. The owners used to starve the freaks and keep them locked up in cages and treat them like dirt. But I don't know what this one will be like. They might not even be real freaks: they might only be people in costumes.\"</p><p>The freak show was being held at a place near the other side of town. We had to leave shortly after nine o'clock, to make sure we got there in time. We could have got a cab, except we'd used most of our allowance to replace the cash Steve took from his mom. Besides, it was more fun walking. It was spookier!</p><p>We told ghost stories as we walked. Steve did most of the talking, because he knows way more than me. He was in rare form. Sometimes he forgets the ends of stories, or gets names mixed up, but not tonight. It was better than being with Stephen King!</p><p>It was a long walk, longer than we thought, and we almost didn't make it on time. We had to run the last quarter-mile. We were panting like dogs when we got there.</p><p>The venue was an old theater that used to show movies. I'd passed it once or twice in the past. Steve told me once that it was shut down because a boy fell off the balcony and got killed. He said it was haunted. I asked my dad about it, and he said it was a pack of lies. It's hard sometimes to know whether you should believe the stories your dad tells you or the ones your best friend tells you.</p><p>There was no name outside the door, and no cars parked nearby, and no waiting line. We stopped out front and bent over until we got our breath back. Then we stood and looked at the building. It was tall and dark and covered in jagged gray stones. Lots of the windows were broken, and the door looked like a giant's open mouth.</p><p>\"Are you sure this is the place?\" I asked, trying not to sound scared.</p><p>\"This is what it says on the tickets,\" Steve said and checked again, just to be sure. \"Yep, this is it.\"</p><p>\"Maybe the police found out and the freaks had to move on,\" I said. \"Maybe there isn't any show tonight.\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\" Steve said.</p><p>I looked at him and licked my lips nervously. \"What do you think we should do?\" I asked.</p><p>He stared back at me and hesitated before replying. \"I think we should go in,\" he finally said. \"We've come this far. It'd be silly to turn back now, without knowing for sure.\"</p><p>\"I agree,\" I said, nodding. Then I gazed up at the scary building and gulped. It looked like the sort of place you saw in a horror movie, where lots of people go in but don't come out. \"Are you scared?\" I asked Steve.</p>","<p>\"No,\" he said, but I could hear his teeth chattering and knew he was lying. \"Are you? \" he asked.</p><p>\"Course not,\" I said. We looked at each other and grinned. We knew we were both terrified, but at least we were together. It's not so bad being scared if you're not alone.</p><p>\"Shall we enter?\" Steve asked, trying to sound cheerful.</p><p>\"Might as well,\" I said.</p><p>We took a deep breath, crossed our fingers, then started up the steps (there were nine stone steps leading up to the door, each one cracked and covered with moss) and went in.</p><p>Chapter EIGHT</p><p>WE FOUND OURSELVES STANDING in a long, dark, cold corridor. I had my jacket on, but shivered anyway. It was freezing!</p><p>\"Why is it so cold?\" I asked Steve. \"It was warm outside.\"</p><p>\"Old houses are like that,\" he told me.</p><p>We started to walk. There was a light down by the other end, so the farther in we got, the brighter it became. I was glad for that. I don't think I could have made it otherwise: it would have been too scary!</p><p>The walls were scratched and scribbled on, and bits of the ceiling were flaky. It was a creepy place. It would have been bad enough in the middle of the day, but this was ten o'clock, only two hours away from midnight!</p><p>\"There's a door here,\" Steve said and stopped. He pushed it ajar and it creaked loudly. I almost turned and ran. It sounded like the lid of a coffin being tugged open!</p><p>Steve showed no fear and stuck his head in. He said nothing for a few seconds, while his eyes got used to the dark, then he pulled back. \"It's the stairs up to the balcony,\" he said.</p><p>\"Where the kid fell from?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"Do you think we should go up?\" I asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \"I don't think so. It's dark up there, no sign of any sort of light. We'll try it if we can't find another way in, but I think...\"</p><p>\"Can I help you boys?\" somebody said behind us, and we nearly jumped out of our skins!</p><p>We turned around quickly and the tallest man in the world was standing there, glaring down on us as if we were a couple of rats. He was so tall, his head almost touched the ceiling. He had huge bony hands and eyes that were so dark, they looked like two black coals stuck in the middle of his face.</p><p>\"Isn't it rather late for two little boys like yourselves to be out and about?\" he asked. His voice was as deep and croaky as a frog's, but his lips hardly seemed to move. He would have made a great ventriloquist.</p><p>\"We...\" Steve began, but had to stop and lick his lips before he could continue. \"We're here to see the Cirque Du Freak,\" he said.</p><p>\"Are you?\" The man nodded slowly. \"Do you have tickets?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Steve said, and showed his.</p><p>\"Very good,\" the man muttered. Then he turned to me and said: \"How about you, Darren? Do you have a ticket?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said, reaching into my pocket. Then I stopped dead in my tracks. He knew my name! I glanced at Steve and he was shaking in his sneakers.</p><p>The tall man smiled. He had black teeth and some were missing, and his tongue was a dirty shade of yellow. \"My name is Mr. Tall,\" he said. \"I own the Cirque Du Freak.\"</p><p>\"How did you know my friend's name?\" Steve asked bravely.</p><p>Mr. Tall laughed and bent down, so he was eyeball-to-eyeball with Steve. \"I know lots of things,\" he said softly. I know your names. I know where you live. I know you don't like your mommy or your daddy.\" He turned to face me and I took a step back. His breath stank to the high heavens. \"I know you didn't tell your parents you were coming here. And I know how you won your ticket.\"</p><p>\"How?\" I asked. My teeth were shaking so much, I wasn't sure if he heard me or not. If he did, he decided not to answer, because next he stood up and turned away from us.</p><p>\"We must hurry,\" he said, beginning to walk. I thought he would take giant steps, but he didn't, he took short ones. \"The show is about to begin. Everyone else is present and seated. You are late, boys. You're lucky we didn't start without you.\"</p><p>He turned a corner at the end of the corridor. He was only two or three steps in front of us, but when we turned the corner, he was sitting behind a long table covered with a black cloth that reached down to the floor. He was wearing a tall red hat now, and a pair of gloves.</p><p>\"Tickets, please,\" he said. He reached out, took them, opened his mouth, put the tickets in, then chewed them to pieces and swallowed!</p><p>\"Very well,\" he said. \"You may go in now. We normally don't welcome children, but I can see you are two fine, courageous young men. We will make an exception.\"</p><p>There were two blue curtains in front of us, drawn across the end of the hall. Steve and me looked at each other and gulped.</p><p>\"Do we walk straight on?\" Steve asked.</p><p>\"Of course,\" Mr. Tall said.</p><p>\"Isn't there a lady with a flashlight?\" I asked.</p><p>He laughed. \"If you want someone to hold your hand,\" he said, \"you should have brought a babysitter!\"</p><p>That made me mad and I forgot for a moment how afraid I was. \"All right,\" I snapped, stepping forward, surprising Steve. \"If that's the way it is...\" I walked forward quickly and pushed past the curtains.</p><p>I don't know what those curtains were made of, but they felt like spiderwebs. I stopped once I passed them. I was in a short corridor and another pair of curtains were draped across the walls a few yards in front. There was a sound behind and then Steve was by my side. We could hear noises on the other side of the curtains.</p><p>\"Do you think it's safe?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I think it's safer to go forward than backward,\" he answered. \"I don't think Mr. Tall would like it if we turned back.\"</p><p>\"How do you think he knew all that stuff about us? \"I asked.</p><p>\"He must be able to read minds,\" Steve replied.</p><p>\"Oh,\" I said, and thought about that for a few seconds. \"He nearly scared the life out of me,\" I admitted.</p><p>\"Me, too,\" Steve said.</p><p>Then we stepped forward.</p><p>It was a huge room. The chairs had been ripped out of the theater long ago, but deck chairs had been set up in their place. We looked for empty seats. The entire theater was packed, but we were the only children there. I could feel people watching us and whispering.</p><p>The only spaces were in the fourth row from the front. We had to step over lots of legs to get there and people were grumbling. When we sat down, we realized they were good seats, because we were right in the middle and nobody tall was in front of us. We had a perfect view of the stage and could see everything.</p>","<p>\"Do you think they sell popcorn?\" I asked.</p><p>\"At a freak show?\" Steve snorted. \"Get real! They might sell snake eggs and lizard eyes, but I'll bet anything you like they don't sell popcorn!\"</p><p>The people in the theater were a mixed bunch. Some were dressed stylishly, others in sweatsuits. Some were as old as the hills, others just a few years older than Steve and me. Some chatted confidently to their companions and behaved as though at a soccer game, others sat quietly in their chairs and gazed around nervously.</p><p>What everyone shared was a look of excitement.</p><p>I could see it in their eyes, the same light that was shining in Steve's and mine. We all somehow knew that we were in for something special, the likes of which we'd never seen before.</p><p>Then a bunch of trumpets blew and the whole place went quiet. The trumpets blew for ages and ages, getting louder and louder, and every light went out until the theater was pitch black. I began to get scared again, but it was too late to leave.</p><p>All of a sudden, the trumpets stopped and there was silence. My ears were ringing and for a few seconds I felt dizzy. Then I recovered and sat up straight in my seat.</p><p>Somewhere high up in the theater, someone switched on a green light and the stage lit up. It looked eerie! For about a minute nothing else happened. Then two men came out, pulling a cage. It was on wheels and covered with what looked like a huge bearskin rug. When they got to the middle of the stage they stopped, dropped the ropes, and ran back into the wings.</p><p>For a few seconds more silence. Then the trumpets blew again, three short blasts. The rug came flying off the cage and the first freak was revealed.</p><p>That was when the screaming began.</p><p>Chapter NINE</p><p>THERE WAS NO NEED for the screaming. The freak was pretty shocking, but he was chained up inside the cage. I think the people who screamed did it for fun, the way people scream on a roller coaster, not because they were actually afraid.</p><p>It was the wolf-man. He was very ugly, with hair all over his body. He only wore a piece of cloth around his middle, like Tarzan, so we could see his hairy legs and belly and back and arms. He had a long bushy beard, which covered most of his face. His eyes were yellow and his teeth were red.</p><p>He shook the bars of the cage and roared. It was pretty frightening. Lots more people screamed when he roared. I nearly screamed myself, except I didn't want to look like a baby.</p><p>The wolf-man went on shaking the bars and jumping around, before calming down. When he was sitting on his backside, the way dogs do, Mr. Tall walked on and spoke.</p><p>\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said, and even though his voice was low and croaky, everybody could hear what he was saying, \"welcome to the Cirque Du Freak, home of the world's most remarkable human beings.</p><p>\"We are an ancient circus,\" he went on. \"We have toured for five hundred years, bringing the grotesque to generation after generation. Our lineup has changed many times, but never our aim, which is to astound and terrify you! We present acts both frightening and bizarre, acts you can find nowhere else in the world.</p><p>\"Those who are easily scared should leave now,\" he warned. \"I'm sure there are people who came tonight thinking this was a joke. Maybe they thought our freaks would be people in masks, or harmless misfits. This is not so! Every act you see tonight is real. Each performer is unique. And none are harmless.\"</p><p>That was the end of his speech and he walked offstage Two pretty women in shiny suits came on next and unlocked the door of the wolf-man's cage. A few people looked scared but nobody left.</p><p>The wolf-man was yapping and howling when he first came out of the cage, until one of the ladies hypnotized him with her fingers. The other lady spoke to the crowd.</p><p>\"You must be very quiet,\" she said in a foreign accent. \"The wolf-man will not be able to hurt you as long as we control him, but a loud sound could wake him up, and then he would be deadly!\"</p><p>When they were ready, they stepped down from the stage and walked the hypnotized wolf-man through the theater. His hair was a dirty gray color and he walked with a stoop, fingers hanging down around his knees.</p><p>The ladies stayed by his side and warned people to be quiet. They let you stroke him if you wanted, but you had to do it gently. Steve rubbed him when he went by but I was afraid he might wake up and bite me, so I didn't.</p><p>\"What did it feel like?\" I asked, as quietly as I could.</p><p>\"It was spiky,\" Steve replied, \"like a hedgehog.\" He lifted his fingers to his nose and sniffed. \"It smells strange, too, like burning rubber.\"</p><p>The wolf-man and ladies were about halfway down the rows of seats when there was a big BANG! I don't know what made the noise, but suddenly the wolf-man began roaring and he shoved the ladies away from him.</p><p>People screamed and those nearest him leaped from their seats and ran. One woman wasn't quick enough, and the wolf-man leaped on her and dragged her to the ground. She was screaming at the top of her lungs, but nobody tried to help her. He rolled her over onto her back and bared his teeth. She stuck a hand up to push him away, but he got his teeth on it and bit it off!</p><p>A couple of people fainted when they saw that and a bunch more began yelling and running. Then, out of nowhere, Mr. Tall appeared behind the wolf-man and wrapped his arms around him. The wolf-man struggled for a few seconds, but Mr. Tall whispered something in his ear and he relaxed. While Mr. Tall led him back to the stage, the women in the suits calmed down the crowd and told them to return to their seats.</p><p>While the crowd hesitated, the woman with the bitten-off hand went on screaming. Blood was pumping out of the end of her wrist, covering the ground and other people. Steve and I were staring at her, our mouths wide open, wondering if she was going to die.</p><p>Mr. Tall returned from the stage, picked up the severed hand, and gave a loud whistle. Two people in blue robes with hoods over their heads ran forward. They were short, not much bigger than me or Steve, but with thick arms and legs and lots of muscles. Mr. Tall sat the woman up and whispered something in her ear. She stopped screaming and sat stiff.</p><p>Mr. Tall took hold of the wrist, then reached into his pocket and took out a small brown leather pouch. He opened it with his free hand and sprinkled a sparkly pink powder onto the bleeding wrist. Then he stuck the hand against it and nodded to the two people in the blue suits. They produced a pair of needles and loads of orange string. And then, to the amazement of everybody in the theater, they started to stitch the hand back onto the wrist!</p>","<p>The people in blue robes stitched for five or six minutes. The woman didn't feel any pain, even though their needles were going in and out of her flesh, all the way around the wrist. When finished, they put their needles and unused thread away and returned to wherever they'd come from. Their hoods never slipped from their faces, so I couldn't tell if they were men or women. When they'd gone, Mr. Tall let go of the woman's hand and stepped back.</p><p>\"Move your fingers,\" he said. The woman stared at him blankly. \"Move your fingers!\" he said again, and this time she gave them a wiggle.</p><p>They moved!</p><p>Everybody gasped. The woman stared at the fingers as though she didn't believe they were real. She gave them another wiggle. Then she stood and lifted the hand above her head. She shook it as hard as she could, and it was as good as new! You could see the stitches but there was no more blood and the fingers seemed to be working fine.</p><p>\"You will be okay,\" Mr. Tall told her. \"The stitches will fall out after a couple of days. It will be fine after that.\"</p><p>\"Maybe that's not good enough!\" someone shouted, and a big red-faced man stepped forward. \"I'm her husband,\" he said, \"and I say we should go to a doctor and then the police! You can't let a wild animal like that out into a crowd! What if he'd bitten her head off?\"</p><p>\"Then she would be dead,\" Mr. Tall said calmly.</p><p>\"Listen, buster,\" the husband began, but Mr. Tall interrupted.</p><p>\"Tell me, sir,\" Mr. Tall said, \"where were you when the wolf-man was attacking?\"</p><p>\"Me?\" the man asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Mr. Tall said. \"You are her husband. You were sitting beside her when the beast escaped. Why did you not leap to her rescue?\"</p><p>\"Well, I...There was no time...I couldn't...I wasn't...\"</p><p>No matter what he said, the husband couldn't win, because there was only one true answer: he had been running away, looking after himself.</p><p>\"Listen to me,\" Mr. Tall said. \"I gave fair warning. I said this show could be dangerous. This is not a nice, safe circus where nothing goes wrong. Mistakes can and do happen, and sometimes people end up a lot worse off than your wife. That's why this show is banned. That's why we must play in old theaters in the middle of the night. Most of the time, things go smoothly and nobody gets hurt. But we cannot guarantee your safety.\"</p><p>Mr. Tall turned around in a circle and seemed to look everybody in the eye while turning. \"We cannot guarantee anybody's safety,\" he roared. \"Another accident like this is unlikely, but it could happen. Once again I say, if you are afraid, leave. Leave now, before it is too late!\"</p><p>A few people did leave. But most stayed to see the rest of the show, even the woman who nearly lost her hand.</p><p>\"Do you want to go?\" I asked Steve, half-hoping he'd say yes. I was excited but scared as well.</p><p>\"Are you crazy?\" he said. \"This is great! You don't want to go, do you?\"</p><p>\"No way,\" I lied, and slapped on a shaky little smile.</p><p>If only I hadn't been so scared of looking like a coward! I could have left and everything would have been fine. But no, I had to act like a big man and sit it out to the end. If you only knew how many times I've wished since then that I'd fled with all the speed in my body and never looked back...</p><p>Chapter TEN</p><p>Chapter TEN</p><p>AS SOON AS MR. TALL had left the stage and we'd settled back into our seats, the second freak, Alexander Ribs, came out. He was more of a comedy act than a scary one, which was just what we needed to calm us down after the terrifying start. I happened to look over my shoulder while he was on, and noticed two of the blue-hooded people down on their knees, cleaning blood from the floor.</p><p>Alexander Ribs was the skinniest man I'd ever seen. He looked like a skeleton! There seemed to be no flesh on him. He would have been frightening, except he had a wide friendly smile.</p><p>Funny music played and he danced around the stage. He was dressed in ballet clothes and looked so ridiculous that soon everyone was laughing. After a while, he stopped dancing and began stretching. He said he was a contortionist (somebody with bones like rubber, who can bend every which way).</p><p>First, he tilted his head back so far, it looked like it had been cut off. He turned around so we could see his upside-down face, then went on leaning backward until his head was touching the floor! Then he put his hands around the backs of his legs and pulled his head through until it was sticking up in front of him. It looked like it was growing out of his stomach!</p><p>He got a huge round of applause for that, after which he straightened up and began twisting his body around like a curly-wurly straw! He kept twisting and twisting, five times around, until his bones began to creak from the strain. He stood like that for a minute, then began to unwind really, really fast.</p><p>Next, he got two drumsticks with furry ends. He took the first drumstick and hit one of his bony ribs with it. He opened his mouth and a musical note sprang out! It sounded like the noise pianos make. Then he closed his mouth and struck a rib on the other side of his body. This time it was a louder, higher note.</p><p>After a few more practice notes, he kept his mouth open and began playing songs! He played \"London Bridge Is Falling Down,\" some songs by the Beatles, and the theme tunes from a few popular TV shows.</p><p>The skinny man left the stage to shouts for more. But none of the freaks ever came back to do an encore.</p><p>After Alexander Ribs came Rhamus Twobellies, and he was as fat as Alexander was thin. He was eNOR-mous! The floorboards creaked as he walked out onto the stage.</p><p>He walked close to the edge and kept pretending he was about to topple forward. I could see people in the front rows getting worried, and some jumped back out of the way when he got close. I don't blame them: he would have squashed them flat as a pancake if he fell!</p><p>He stopped in the middle of the stage. \"Hello,\" he said. He had a nice voice, soft and squeaky. \"My name is Rhamus Twobellies, and I really have two bellies! I was born with them, the same way certain animals are. The doctors were stunned and said I was a freak. That's why I joined this show and am here tonight.\"</p><p>The ladies who had hypnotized the wolf-man came out with two carts full of food: cakes, chips, hamburgers, packages of candy and heads of cabbage. There was stuff there that I hadn't even seen before, never mind tasted!</p><p>\"Yum yum,\" Rhamus said. He pointed to a huge clock being lowered by ropes from above. It stopped about ten feet above his head. \"How long do you think it will take me to eat all this?\" he asked, pointing to the food. \"There will be a prize for the person who guesses closest.\"</p>","<p>\"An hour!\" somebody yelled.</p><p>\"Forty-five minutes!\" somebody else roared.</p><p>\"Two hours, ten minutes, and thirty-three seconds,\" another person shouted. Soon everybody was calling out. I said an hour and three minutes. Steve said twenty-nine minutes. The lowest guess was seventeen minutes.</p><p>When we were finished guessing, the clock started to tick and Rhamus started to eat. He ate like the wind. His arms moved so fast, you could hardly see them. His mouth didn't seem to close at all. He shoveled food in, swallowed, and moved on.</p><p>Everybody was amazed. I felt sick as I watched. Some people actually were sick!</p><p>Finally, Rhamus scoffed the last bun and the clock above his head stopped ticking.</p><p>Four minutes and fifty-six seconds! He'd eaten all that food in less than five minutes! I could hardly believe it. It didn't seem possible, even for a man with two bellies.</p><p>\"That was nice,\" Rhamus said, \"but I could have used more dessert.\"</p><p>While we clapped and laughed, the ladies in shiny suits rolled the carts away and brought out a new one, packed with glass statues and forks and spoons and bits of metal junk.</p><p>\"Before I begin,\" Rhamus said, \"I must warn you not to try this at home! I can eat things that would choke and kill normal people. Do not try to copy me! If you do, you may die.\"</p><p>He began eating. He started with a couple of nuts and bolts, which he sucked down without blinking. After a few handfuls he gave his big round belly a shake and we could hear the noise of the metal inside.</p><p>His belly heaved and he spat the nuts and bolts back out! If there had only been one or two, I might have thought he was keeping them under his tongue or at the sides of his cheeks, but not even Rhamus Twobellies's mouth was big enough to hold that load!</p><p>Next, he ate the glass statues. He crunched the glass up into small pieces before swallowing it with a drink of water. Then he ate the spoons and forks. He twisted them up into circles with his hands, popped them into his mouth, and let them slide down. He said his teeth weren't strong enough to tear through metal.</p><p>After that, he swallowed a long metal chain, then paused to catch his breath. His belly began rumbling and shaking. I didn't know what was going on, until he gave a heave and I saw the top of the chain come out of his mouth.</p><p>As the chain came out, I saw that the spoons and forks were wrapped around it! He had managed to poke the chain through the hoops inside his belly. It was unbelievable.</p><p>When Rhamus left the stage, I thought nobody could top such an act.</p><p>I was wrong!</p><p>Chapter ELEVEN</p><p>ACOUPLE OF PEOPLE in the blue-hooded robes came around after Rhamus Twobellies, selling gifts. There was some really cool stuff, like chocolate models of the nuts and bolts that Rhamus ate, and rubber dolls of Alexander Ribs that you could bend and stretch. And there were clippings of the wolf-man's hair. I bought some of that: it was tough and wiry, sharp as a knife.</p><p>\"There will be more novelties later,\" Mr. Tall announced from the stage, \"so don't spend all your money right away.\"</p><p>\"How much is the glass statue?\" Steve asked. It was the same kind that Rhamus Twobellies had eaten. The person in the blue hood didn't say anything, but stuck out a sign with the price on it. \"I can't read,\" Steve said. \"Will you tell me how much it costs?\"</p><p>I stared at Steve and wondered why he was lying. The person in the hood still didn't speak. This time he (or she) shook his head quickly and moved on before Steve could ask anything else.</p><p>\"What was that about?\" I asked.</p><p>Steve shrugged. \"I wanted to hear it speak,\" he said, \"to see if it was human or not.\"</p><p>\"Of course it's human,\" I said. \"What else could it be?\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" he said. \"That's why I was asking. Don't you think it's strange that they keep their faces covered all the time?\"</p><p>\"Maybe they're shy,\" I said.</p><p>\"Maybe,\" he said, but I could tell he didn't believe that.</p><p>When the people selling the gifts were finished, the next freak came on. It was the bearded lady, and at first I thought it was meant to be a joke, because she didn't have a beard!</p><p>Mr. Tall stood behind her and said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very special act. Truska here is new to our family. She is one of the most incredible performers I have ever seen, with a truly unique talent.\"</p><p>Mr. Tall walked off. Truska was very beautiful, dressed in flowing red robes that had many slashes and gaps. Lots of the men in the theater began to cough and shift around in their seats.</p><p>Truska stepped closer to the edge of the stage, so we could see her better, then said something that sounded like a seal barking. She put her hands on her face, one at either side, and stroked the skin gently. Then she held her nose shut with two fingers and tickled her chin with her other hand.</p><p>An extraordinary thing happened: she began to grow a beard! Hairs crept out, first on her chin, then her upper lip, then the sides of her face, finally all over. It was long and blonde and straight.</p><p>It grew about four or five inches, then stopped. She took her fingers away from her nose and stepped down into the crowd, where she walked around and let people pull on the beard and stroke it.</p><p>The beard continued growing as she walked, until finally it reached down to her feet! When she arrived at the rear of the theater, she turned and walked back to the stage. Even though there was no breeze, her hair blew about wildly, tickling people's faces as she passed.</p><p>When she was back on the stage, Mr. Tall asked if anybody had a pair of scissors. Lots of women did. Mr. Tall invited a few up.</p><p>\"The Cirque Du Freak will give one solid bar of gold to anyone who can slice off Truska's beard,\" he said, and held up a small yellow piece of metal to show he wasn't joking.</p><p>That got a lot of people excited and for ten minutes nearly everybody in the theater tried cutting off her beard. But they couldn't! Nothing could cut through the bearded lady's hair, not even a pair of garden shears that Mr. Tall handed out. The funny thing was, it still felt soft, just like ordinary hair!</p><p>When everyone had admitted defeat, Mr. Tall emptied the stage and Truska stood in the middle again. She stroked her cheeks as before and held her nose, but this time the beard grew back in! It took about two minutes for the hairs to disappear back inside, and then she looked exactly as she had when she first came out. She left to huge applause and the next act came out almost directly after.</p>","<p>His name was Hans Hands. He began by telling us about his father, who'd been born without legs. Hans's father learned to get around on his hands just as well as other people could on their feet, and had taught his children his secrets.</p><p>Hans then sat down, pulled up his legs, and wrapped his feet around his neck. He stood on his hands, walked up and down the stage, then hopped off and challenged four men picked at random to a race. They could race on their feet; he'd race on his hands. He promised a bar of gold to anyone who could beat him.</p><p>They used the aisles of the theater as a racetrack, and despite his disadvantage, Hans beat the four men easily. He claimed he could sprint a hundred yards in eight seconds on his hands, and nobody in the theater doubted him. Afterward he performed some impressive gymnastic feats, proving that a person could manage just as well without legs as with them. His act wasn't especially exciting but it was enjoyable.</p><p>There was a short pause after Hans had left, then Mr. Tall came out. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said, \"our next act is another unique and perplexing one. It can also be quite dangerous, so I ask that you make no noise and do not clap until you are told it is safe.\"</p><p>The whole place went quiet. After what had happened with the wolf-man earlier, nobody needed to be told twice!</p><p>When it was quiet enough, Mr. Tall walked off the stage. He shouted out the name of the next freak as he went, but it was a soft shout: \"Mr. Crepsley and Madam Octa!\"</p><p>The lights went down low and a creepy-looking man walked onto the stage. He was tall and thin, with very white skin and only a small crop of orange hair on the top of his head. He had a large scar running down his left cheek. It reached to his lips and made it look like his mouth was stretching up the side of his face.</p><p>He was dressed in dark-red clothes and carried a small wooden cage, which he put on a table. When he was set, he turned and faced us. He bowed and smiled. He looked even scarier when he smiled, like a crazy clown in a horror movie I once saw! Then he started to explain about the act.</p><p>I missed the first part of his speech because I wasn't looking at the stage. I was watching Steve. You see, when Mr. Crepsley walked out, there had been total silence, except for one person who had gasped loudly.</p><p>Steve.</p><p>I stared curiously at my friend. He was almost as white as Mr. Crepsley and was shaking all over. He'd even dropped the rubber model of Alexander Ribs that he'd bought.</p><p>His eyes were fixed on Mr. Crepsley, as though glued to him, and as I watched him watch the freak, the thought that crossed my mind was: \"He looks like he's seen a ghost!\"</p><p>Chapter TWELVE</p><p>\"IT IS NOT TRUE that all tarantulas are poisonous,\" Mr. Crepsley said. He had a deep voice. I managed to tear my eyes away from Steve and trained them on the stage. \"Most are as harmless as the spiders you find anywhere in the world. And those which are poisonous normally only have enough poison in them to kill very small creatures.</p><p>\"But some are deadly!\" he went on. \"Some can kill a man with one bite. They are rare, and only found in extremely remote areas, but they do exist.</p><p>\"I have one such spider,\" he said and opened the door of the cage. For a few seconds nothing happened, but then the largest spider I had ever seen crawled out. It was green and purple and red, with long hairy legs and a big fat body. I wasn't afraid of spiders, but this one looked terrifying.</p><p>The spider walked forward slowly. Then its legs bent and it lowered its body, as though waiting for a fly.</p><p>\"Madam Octa has been with me for several years,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"She lives far longer than ordinary spiders. The monk who sold her to me said some of her kind live to be twenty or thirty years old. She is an incredible creature, both poisonous and intelligent.\"</p><p>While he was speaking, one of the blue-hooded people led a goat onto the stage. It was making a frightened bleating noise and kept trying to run. The hooded person tied it to the table and left.</p><p>The spider began moving when it saw and heard the goat. It crept to the edge of the table, where it stopped, as if awaiting an order. Mr. Crepsley produced a shiny tin whistle he called it a flute from his pants pocket and blew a few short notes. Madam Octa immediately leaped through the air and landed on the goat's neck.</p><p>The goat gave a leap when the spider landed, and began bleating loudly. Madam Octa took no notice, hung on, and moved a few inches closer to the head. When she was ready, she bared her fangs and sunk them deep into the goat's neck!</p><p>The goat froze and its eyes went wide. It stopped bleating and, a few seconds later, toppled over. I thought it was dead, but then realized it was still breathing.</p><p>\"This flute is how I control Madam Octa,\" Mr. Crepsley said, and I looked away from the fallen goat. He waved the flute slowly above his head. \"Though we have been together such a long time, she is not a pet, and would surely kill me if I ever lost it.</p><p>\"The goat is paralyzed,\" he said. \"I have trained Madam Octa not to kill outright with her first bite. The goat would die in the end, if we left it there is no cure for Madam Octa's bite but we shall finish it quickly.\" He blew on the flute and Madam Octa moved up the goat's neck until she was standing on its ear. She bared her fangs again and bit. The goat shivered, then went totally still.</p><p>It was dead.</p><p>Madam Octa dropped from the goat and crawled toward the front of the stage. The people in the front rows became very alarmed and some jumped to their feet. But they froze at a short command from Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>\"'Do not move!\" he hissed. \"Remember your earlier warning: a sudden noise could mean death!\"</p><p>Madam Octa stopped at the edge of the stage, then stood on her two back legs, just like a dog! Mr. Crepsley blew softly on his flute and she began walking backward, still on two feet. When she reached the nearest leg of the table, she turned and climbed up.</p><p>\"You will be safe now,\" Mr. Crepsley said, and the people in the front rows sat down again, as slowly and quietly as they could. \"But please,\" he added, \"do not make any loud noises, because if you do, she might come after me.\"</p><p>I don't know if Mr. Crepsley was really scared, or if it was part of the act, but he looked frightened. He wiped the sleeve of his right arm over his forehead, then placed the flute back in his mouth and whistled a strange little tune.</p><p>Madam Octa cocked her head, then appeared to nod. She crawled across the table until she was in front of Mr. Crepsley. He lowered his right hand, and she crept up his arm. The thought of those long hairy legs creeping along his flesh made me sweat all over. And I liked spiders! People who were afraid of them must have been nervously chewing the insides of their cheeks to pieces.</p>","<p>When she got to the top of his arm, she scuttled along his shoulder, up his neck, over his ear, and didn't stop until she reached the top of his head, where she lowered her body. She looked like a funny kind of a hat.</p><p>After a while, Mr. Crepsley began playing the flute again. Madam Octa slid down the other side of his face, along the scar, and walked around until she was standing upside down on his chin. Then she spun a string of web and dropped down on it.</p><p>She was hanging about three inches below his chin now, and slowly began rocking from side to side. Soon she was swinging about level with his ears. Her legs were tucked in, and from where I was sitting she looked like a ball of wool.</p><p>Then, as she made an upward swing, Mr. Crepsley threw his head back and she went flying straight up into the air. The thread snapped and she tumbled around and around. I watched her go up, then come down. I thought she'd land on the floor or the table, but she didn't. Instead, she landed in Mr. Crepsley's mouth!</p><p>I nearly got sick when I thought of Madam Octa sliding down his throat and into his belly. I was sure she'd bite him and kill him. But the spider was a lot smarter than I knew. As she was falling, she'd stuck her legs out and they had caught on his lips.</p><p>He brought his head forward, so we could see his face. His mouth was wide open and Madam Octa was hanging between his lips. Her body throbbed in and out of his mouth and she looked like a balloon that he was blowing up and letting the air out of.</p><p>I wondered where the flute was and how he was going to control the spider now. Then Mr. Tall appeared with another flute. He couldn't play as well as Mr. Crepsley, but he was good enough to make Madam Octa take notice. She listened, then moved from one side of Mr. Crepsley's mouth to the other.</p><p>I didn't know what she was doing at first, so I craned my neck to see. When I saw the bits of white on Mr. Crepsley's lips I understood: she was spinning a web!</p><p>When she was finished, she lowered herself from his chin, like she had before. There was a large web spun across Mr. Crepsley's mouth. He began chewing and licking the web! He ate the whole thing, then rubbed his belly (being careful not to hit Madam Octa) and said, \"Delicious. Nothing tastier than fresh spiderwebs. They are a treat where I come from.\"</p><p>He made Madam Octa push a ball across the table, then got her to balance on top of it. He set up small pieces of gym gear, tiny weights and ropes and rings, and put her through her paces. She was able to do all the things a human could, like lift weights above her head and climb ropes and pull herself up on the rings.</p><p>Then he brought out a tiny dinner set. There were mini plates and knives and forks and teeny-weeny glasses. The plates were filled with dead flies and other small insects. I don't know what was in the glasses.</p><p>Madam Octa ate that dinner as neatly as you please. She was able to pick up the knives and forks, four at a time, and feed herself. There was even a fake saltshaker that she sprinkled over one of the dishes!</p><p>It was around the time she was drinking from the glass that I decided Madam Octa was the world's most amazing pet. I would have given everything I owned for her. I knew it could never be Mom and Dad wouldn't let me keep her even if I could buy her but that didn't stop me from wishing.</p><p>When the act was over, Mr. Crepsley put the spider back in her cage and bowed low while everybody clapped. I heard a lot of people saying it wasn't fair to have killed the poor goat, but it had been thrilling.</p><p>I turned to Steve to tell him how great I thought the spider was, but he was watching Mr. Crepsley. He didn't look scared anymore, but he didn't look normal, either.</p><p>\"Steve, what's wrong?\" I asked.</p><p>He didn't answer.</p><p>\"Steve?\"</p><p>\"Ssshhh!\" he snapped, and wouldn't say another word until Mr. Crepsley had left. He watched the odd-looking man walk back to the wings. Then he turned to me and gasped: \"This is amazing!\"</p><p>\"The spider?\" I asked. \"It was great. How do you think...\"</p><p>\"I'm not talking about the spider!\" he snapped. \"Who cares about a silly old arachnid? I'm talking about Mr...Crepsley.\" He paused before saying the man's name, as though he'd been about to call him something different.</p><p>\"Mr. Crepsley?\" I asked, confused. \"What was so great about him? All he did was play the flute.\"</p><p>\"You don't understand,\" Steve said angrily. \"You don't know who he really is.\"</p><p>\"And you do?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he said, \"as a matter of fact I do.\" He rubbed his chin and started looking worried again. \"I just hope he doesn't know I know. If he does, we might never make it out of here alive...\"</p><p>Chapter THIRTEEN</p><p>THERE WAS ANOTHER BREAK after Mr. Crepsley and Madam Octa's act. I tried getting Steve to tell me more about who the man was, but his lips were sealed. All he said was: \"I have to think about this.\" Then he closed his eyes, lowered his head, and thought hard.</p><p>They were selling more cool stuff during the break: beards like the bearded lady's, models of Hans Hands, and, best of all, rubber spiders that looked like Madam Octa. I bought two, one for me and one for Annie. They weren't as good as the real thing but they'd have to do.</p><p>They were also selling candy webs. I bought six of those, using up the last of my money, and ate two while waiting for the next freak to come out. They tasted like cotton candy. I stuck the second one over my lips and licked at it the same way Mr. Crepsley had.</p><p>The lights went down and everybody settled back into their seats. Gertha Teeth was next up. She was a big woman with thick legs, thick arms, a thick neck, and a thick head.</p><p>\"Ladies and gentlemen, I am Gertha Teeth!\" she said. She sounded strict. \"I have the strongest teeth in the world! When I was a baby, my father put his ringers in my mouth, playing with me, and I bit two of them off!\"</p><p>A few people laughed, but she stopped them with a furious look. \"I am not a comedian!\" she snapped. \"If you laugh at me again, I will come down and bite your nose off!\" That sounded pretty funny, but nobody dared chuckle.</p><p>She spoke very loudly. Every sentence was a shout and ended in an exclamation mark(!).</p><p>\"Dentists all over the world have been astounded by my teeth!\" she said. \"I have been examined in every major dental center, but nobody has been able to figure out why they are so tough! I have been offered huge amounts of money to become a guinea pig, but I like traveling and so I have refused!\"</p>","<p>She picked up four steel bars, each about ten inches long, but different widths. She asked for volunteers and four men went up onstage. She gave each of them a bar and said to try bending them. They did their best, but weren't able. When they had failed, she took the thinnest bar, put it in her mouth, and bit clean through it!</p><p>She handed the two halves back to one of the men. He stared at them in shock, then put one end in his own mouth and bit on it, to check that it was real steel. His howls when he almost cracked his teeth proved that it was.</p><p>Gertha did the same to the second and third bars, each of which was thicker than the first. When it came to the fourth, the thickest of the bunch, she chewed it to pieces like a candy bar.</p><p>Next, two of the blue-hooded assistants brought out a large radiator and she bit holes in it! Then they gave her a bike and she gnashed it up into a little ball, tires and all! I don't think there was anything in the world Gertha Teeth couldn't chew her way through if she set her mind to it.</p><p>She called more volunteers up onstage. She gave one a sledgehammer and a large chisel, one a hammer and smaller chisel, and the other an electric saw. She lay flat on her back and put the large chisel in her mouth. She nodded at the first volunteer to swing the sledgehammer at the chisel.</p><p>The man raised the sledgehammer high above his head and brought it down. I thought he was going to smash her face open and so did lots of others, judging by the gasps and people covering their eyes with their hands.</p><p>But Gertha was no fool. She swung out of the way and the sledgehammer slammed into the floor. She sat up and spat the chisel out of her mouth. \"Hah!\" she snorted. \"How crazy do you think I am?\"</p><p>One of the blue-hoods came out and took the sledgehammer from the man. \"I only called you up to show the sledgehammer is real!\" she told him. \"Now,\" she said to those of us in the audience, \"watch!\"</p><p>She lay back again and stuck the chisel in her mouth. The blue-hood waited a moment, then raised the sledgehammer high and swung it down, faster and harder than the man had. It struck the top of the chisel and there was a fierce noise.</p><p>Gertha sat up. I expected to see teeth falling out of her mouth, but when she opened it and removed the chisel, there wasn't as much as a crack to be seen! She laughed and said: \"Hah! You thought I had bitten off more than I could chew!\"</p><p>She let the second volunteer go to work, the one with the smaller hammer and chisel. She warned him to be careful of her gums, then let him position the chisel on her teeth and whack away at it. He nearly hammered his arm off, but he wasn't able to harm her teeth.</p><p>The third volunteer tried sawing them off with the electric saw. He ran the saw from one side of her mouth to the other, and sparks were flying everywhere, but when he put it down and the dust cleared, Gertha's teeth were as white, gleaming, and solid as ever.</p><p>The Twisting Twins, Sive and Seersa, came on after her. They were identical twins and they were contortionists like Alexander Ribs. Their act involved twisting their bodies around each other so they looked like one person with two fronts instead of a back, or two upper bodies and no legs. They were skillful and it was pretty interesting, but dull compared to the rest of the performers.</p><p>When Sive and Seersa were finished, Mr. Tall came out and thanked us for coming. I thought the freaks would come out again and line up in a row, but they didn't. Instead, Mr. Tall said we could buy more stuff at the back of the hall on our way out. He asked us to mention the show to our friends. Then he thanked us again for coming and said that the show was over.</p><p>I was a little disappointed that it had ended so weakly, but it was late and I suppose the freaks were tired. I got to my feet, picked up the stuff I'd bought, and turned to say something to Steve.</p><p>He was looking behind me, up at the balcony, his eyes wide. I turned to see what he was looking at, and as I did, people behind us began to scream. When I looked up, I saw why.</p><p>There was a huge snake up on the balcony, one of the longest I had ever seen, and it was sliding down one of the poles toward the people at the bottom!</p><p>Chapter FOURTEEN</p><p>THE SNAKE'S TONGUE FLICKED IN and out of its mouth and it seemed mighty hungry. It wasn't very colorful dark green, with a few flecks of brighter colors here and there but it looked deadly.</p><p>The people beneath the balcony ran back toward their seats. They were screaming and dropping stuff as they ran. A few people fainted and some fell and were crushed. Steve and I were lucky to be near the front: we were the smallest people in the theater and would have been trampled to death if we'd been caught in the rush.</p><p>The snake was about to slither onto the floor when a strong light fixed itself to the snake's face. The reptile froze and stared into the light without blinking. People stopped running and the panic died down. Those who had fallen pulled themselves back to their feet, and fortunately nobody appeared to be badly hurt.</p><p>There was a sound behind us. I turned to look back at the stage. A boy was up there. He was about fourteen or fifteen, very thin, with long yellowy-green hair. His eyes were oddly shaped, narrow like the snake's. He was dressed in a long white robe.</p><p>The boy made a hissing noise and raised his arms above his head. The robe fell away and everybody who was watching him let out a loud gasp of surprise. His body was covered in scales!</p><p>From head to toe he sparkled, green and gold and yellow and blue. He was wearing a pair of shorts but nothing else. He turned around so we could see his back, and that was the same as the front, except a few shades darker.</p><p>When he faced us again, he lay down on his belly and slid off the stage, just like a snake. It was then that I remembered the snake-boy on the flyer and put two and two together.</p><p>He stood when he reached the floor and walked toward the back of the theater. I saw, as he passed, that he had strange hands and feet: his fingers and toes were joined to each other by thin sheets of skin. He looked a little like that monster I saw in an old horror film, the one who lived in the black lagoon.</p><p>He stopped a few yards away from the pillar and crouched down. The light that had been blinding the snake snapped off and it began to move again, sliding down the last stretch of pole. The boy made another hissing noise and the snake paused. I remembered reading somewhere once that snakes can't hear, but can feel sounds.</p><p>The snake-boy shuffled a little bit to his left, then his right. The snake's head followed him but didn't lunge. The boy crept closer to the snake, until he was within its range. I expected it to strike and kill him, and I wanted to scream at him to run.</p>","<p>But the snake-boy knew what he was doing. When he was close enough he reached out and tickled the snake beneath its chin with his weird webbed fingers. Then he bent forward and kissed it on the nose!</p><p>The snake wrapped itself around the boy's neck. It coiled about him a couple of times, leaving its tail draped over his shoulder and down his back like a scarf.</p><p>The boy stroked the snake and smiled. I thought he was going to walk through the crowd, letting the rest of us rub it, but he didn't. Instead he walked over to the side of the theater, away from the path to the door. He unwrapped the snake and put it down on the floor, then tickled it under its chin once more.</p><p>The mouth opened wide this time, and I saw its fangs. The snake-boy lay down on his back a short distance away from the snake, then began wriggling toward it!</p><p>\"No,\" I said softly to myself. \"Surely he's not going to...\"</p><p>But yes, he stuck his head in the snake's wide-open mouth!</p><p>The snake-boy stayed inside the mouth for a few seconds, then slowly eased out. He wrapped the snake around him once more, then rolled around and around until the snake covered him completely, except for his face. He managed to hop to his feet and grin. He looked like a rolled-up carpet!</p><p>\"And that, ladies and gentlemen,\" said Mr. Tall from the stage behind us, \"really is the end.\" He smiled and leaped from the stage, vanishing in midair in a puff of smoke. When it cleared, I saw him by the back of the theater, holding the exit curtains open.</p><p>The pretty ladies and mysterious blue-hooded people were standing to his left and right, their arms filled with trays full of goodies. I was sorry I hadn't saved some of my money.</p><p>Steve said nothing while we were waiting. I could tell from the serious look on his face that he was still thinking, and from past experience I knew there was no point trying to talk to him. When Steve went into one of his moods, nothing could jolt him out of it.</p><p>When the rows behind us had cleared out, we made our way to the back of the theater. I brought the stuff I'd bought with me. I also lugged Steve's gifts, because he was so wrapped up in his thoughts, he would have dropped them or left them behind.</p><p>Mr. Tall was standing at the back, holding the curtains open, smiling at everyone. The smile widened when we approached.</p><p>\"Well, boys,\" he said, \"did you enjoy the show?\"</p><p>\"It was fabulous!\" I said.</p><p>\"You weren't scared?\" he asked.</p><p>\"A little,\" I admitted, \"but no more than anybody else.\"</p><p>He laughed. \"You're a tough pair,\" he said.</p><p>There were people behind us, so we hurried on, not wanting to hold them up. Steve looked around when we entered the short corridor between the two sets of curtains, then leaned over and whispered in my ear: \"Go back by yourself.\"</p><p>\"What?\" I asked, stopping. The people who had been behind us were chatting with Mr. Tall, so there was no rush.</p><p>\"You heard,\" he said.</p><p>\"Why should I? \"I asked.</p><p>\"Because I'm not coming,\" he said. \"I'm staying. I don't know how things will turn out, but I have to stay. I'll follow you home later, after I've...\" His voice trailed off and he pulled me forward.</p><p>We pushed past the second set of curtains and entered the corridor with the table, the one covered by the long black cloth. The people ahead of us had their backs to us. Steve looked over his shoulder, to make sure nobody could see, then dived underneath the table and hid behind the cloth!</p><p>\"Steve!\" I hissed, worried he was going to get us into trouble.</p><p>\"Go on!\" he hissed back.</p><p>\"But you can't,\" I began.</p><p>\"Do what I say!\" he snapped. \"Go, quick, before we're caught.\"</p><p>I didn't like it but what else could I do? Steve sounded like he'd go crazy if I didn't obey him. I'd seen Steve get into fierce rages before and he wasn't someone you wanted to mess with when he was angry.</p><p>I started walking, turned the corner, and began down the long corridor leading to the front door. I was walking slowly, thinking, and the people in front got farther ahead. I glanced over my shoulder and saw there was still nobody behind me.</p><p>And then I spotted the door.</p><p>It was the one we'd stopped by on our way in, the one leading up to the balcony. I paused when I reached it and checked behind one last time. Nobody there.</p><p>\"Okay,\" I said to myself, \"I'm staying! I don't know what Steve's up to, but he's my best friend. If he gets into trouble, I want to be there to help him out.\"</p><p>Before I could change my mind, I opened the door, slipped through, shut it quickly behind me, and stood in the dark, my heart beating as fast as a mouse's.</p><p>I stood there for a long time, listening while the last of the audience filed out. I could hear their murmurs as they discussed the show in hushed, frightened, but excited tones. Then they were gone and the place was quiet. I thought I'd be able to hear noises from inside the theater, people cleaning up and putting the chairs back in place, but the whole building was as silent as a graveyard.</p><p>I climbed the stairs. My eyes had gotten used to the dark and I could see pretty well. The stairs were old and creaky and I was half-afraid they would snap under my feet and send me hurtling to my death, but they held.</p><p>When I reached the top I discovered I was standing in the middle of the balcony. It was very dusty and dirty up there, and cold, too. I shivered as I crept down toward the front.</p><p>I had a great view of the stage. The lights were still on and I could see everything in perfect detail. Nobody was around, not the freaks, not the pretty ladies, not the blue-hoods not Steve. I sat back and waited.</p><p>About five minutes later, I spotted a shadow creeping slowly toward the stage. It pulled itself up, then stood and walked to the center, where it stopped and turned around.</p><p>It was Steve.</p><p>He started toward the left wing, then stopped and set off toward the right. He stopped again. I could see him chewing on his nails, trying to decide which way to go.</p><p>Then a voice came from high above his head. \"Are you looking for me?\" it asked. A figure swooped down onto the stage, its arms out to its sides, a long red cloak floating behind it like a pair of wings.</p><p>Steve almost jumped out of his skin when the figure hit the stage and rolled into a ball. I toppled backward, terrified. When I rose to my knees again, the figure was standing and I was able to make out its red clothes, orange hair, pale skin, and huge scar.</p>","<p>Mr. Crepsley!</p><p>Steve tried speaking, but his teeth were chattering too much.</p><p>\"I saw you watching me,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"You gasped aloud when you first saw me. Why?\"</p><p>\"B-b-b-because I kn-kn-know who you a-are,\" Steve stuttered, finding his voice.</p><p>\"I am Larten Crepsley,\" the creepy-looking man said.</p><p>\"No,\" Steve replied. \"I know who you really are.\"</p><p>\"Oh?\" Mr. Crepsley smiled, but there was no humor in it. \"Tell me, little boy,\" he sneered, \"who am I, really?\"</p><p>\"Your real name is Vur Horston,\" Steve said, and Mr. Crepsley's jaw dropped in astonishment. And then Steve said something else, and my jaw dropped, too.</p><p>\"You're a vampire,\" he said, and the silence that followed was as long as it was terrifying.</p><p>Chapter FIFTEEN</p><p>MR. CREPSLEY (OR VUR HORSTON, if that was his real name) smiled. \"So,\" he said, \"I have been discovered. I should not be surprised. It had to happen eventually. Tell me, boy, who sent you?\"</p><p>\"Nobody,\" Steve said.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley frowned. \"Come, boy,\" he growled, \"do not play games. Who are you working for? Who put you onto me and what do they want?\"</p><p>\"I'm not working for anybody,\" Steve insisted. \"I've got lots of books and magazines at home about vampires and monsters. There was a picture of you in one of them.\"</p><p>\"A picture?\" Mr. Crepsley asked suspiciously.</p><p>\"A painting,\" Steve replied. \"It was done in 1903, in Paris. You were with a rich woman. The story said the two of you almost married, but she found out you were a vampire and dumped you.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley smiled. \"As good a reason as any. Her friends thought she had invented a fantastic story to make herself look better.\"</p><p>\"But it wasn't a story, was it?\" Steve asked.</p><p>\"No,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed. \"It was not.\" He sighed and fixed Steve with a fierce gaze. \"Though it might have been better for you if it had been!\" he boomed.</p><p>If I'd been in Steve's place, I would have fled as soon as he said that. But Steve didn't even blink.</p><p>\"You won't hurt me,\" he said.</p><p>\"Why not?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"Because of my friend,\" Steve said. \"I told him all about you and if anything happens to me, he'll tell the police.\"</p><p>\"They will not believe him,\" Mr. Crepsley snorted.</p><p>\"Probably not,\" Steve agreed. \"But if I turn up dead or missing, they'll have to investigate. You wouldn't like that. Lots of police asking questions, coming here in the daytime ...\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley shook his head with disgust. \"Children!\" he snarled. \"I hate children. What is it you want? Money? Jewels? The rights to publish my story?\"</p><p>\"I want to join you,\" Steve said.</p><p>I almost fell off the balcony when I heard that. Join him?</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" Mr. Crepsley asked, as stunned as I was.</p><p>\"I want to become a vampire,\" Steve said. \"I want you to make me a vampire and teach me your ways.\"</p><p>\"You are crazy!\" Mr. Crepsley roared.</p><p>\"No,\" Steve said, \"I'm not.\"</p><p>\"I cannot turn a child into a vampire,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"I would be murdered by the Vampire Generals if I did.\"</p><p>\"What are Vampire Generals?\" Steve asked.</p><p>\"Never you mind,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"All you need to know is, it cannot be done. We do not blood children. It creates too many problems.\"</p><p>\"So don't change me right away,\" Steve said. \"That's okay. I don't mind waiting. I can be an apprentice. I know vampires often have assistants who are half-human, half-vampire. Let me be one. I'll work hard and prove myself, and when I'm old enough...\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley stared at Steve and thought it over. He snapped his fingers while he was thinking and a chair flew up onto the stage from the front row! He sat down on it and crossed his legs.</p><p>\"Why do you want to be a vampire?\" he asked. \"It is not much fun. We can only come out at night. Humans despise us. We have to sleep in dirty old places like this. We can never marry or have children or settle down. It is a horrible life.\"</p><p>\"I don't care,\" Steve said stubbornly.</p><p>\"Is it because you want to live forever?\" Mr. Crepsley asked. \"If so, I must tell you we do not. We live far longer than humans, but we die all the same, sooner or later.\"</p><p>\"I don't care,\" Steve said again. \"I want to come with you. I want to learn. I want to become a vampire.\"</p><p>\"What about your friends?\" Mr. Crepsley asked. \"You would not be able to see them again. You would have to leave school and home and never return. What about your parents? Would you not miss them?\"</p><p>Steve shook his head miserably and looked down at the floor. \"My dad doesn't live with us,\" he said softly. \"I hardly ever see him. And my mom doesn't love me. She doesn't care what I do. She probably won't even notice I'm gone.\"</p><p>\"That is why you want to run away? Because your mother does not love you?\"</p><p>\"Partly,\" Steve said.</p><p>\"If you wait a few years, you will be old enough to leave by yourself,\" Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>\"I don't want to wait,\" Steve replied.</p><p>\"And your friends?\" Mr. Crepsley asked again. He looked very kind at the moment, though still a little scary. \"Would you miss the boy you came with tonight?\"</p><p>\"Darren?\" Steve asked, then nodded. \"Yes, I'll miss my friends, Darren especially. But it doesn't matter. I want to be a vampire more than I care about them. And if you don't accept me, I'll tell the police and become a vampire hunter when I grow up!\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley didn't laugh. Instead he nodded seriously. \"You have thought this through?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Steve said.</p><p>\"You are certain it is what you want?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" came the answer.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley took a deep breath. \"Come here,\" he said. \"I will have to test you first.\"</p><p>Steve stood beside Mr. Crepsley. His body blocked my view of the vampire, so I couldn't see what happened next. All I know is, they spoke to each other very softly, then there was a noise like a cat lapping up milk.</p><p>I saw Steve's back shaking and I thought he was going to fall over but somehow he managed to stay upright. I can't even begin to tell you how frightened I was, watching this. I wanted to leap to my feet and cry out, \"No, Steve, stop!\"</p>","<p>But I was too scared to move, terrified that, if Mr. Crepsley knew I was here, there would be nothing to stop him from killing and eating both me and Steve.</p><p>All of a sudden, the vampire began coughing. He pushed Steve away from him and stumbled to his feet. To my horror, I saw his mouth was red, covered in blood, which he quickly spat out.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" Steve asked, rubbing his arm where he had fallen.</p><p>\"You have bad blood!\" Mr. Crepsley screamed.</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" Steve asked. His voice was trembling.</p><p>\"You are evil!\" Mr. Crepsley shouted. \"I can taste the menace in your blood. You are savage.\"</p><p>\"That's a lie!\" Steve yelled. \"You take that back!\"</p><p>Steve ran at Mr. Crepsley and tried to punch him, but the vampire knocked him to the floor with one hand. \"It is no good,\" he growled. \"Your blood is bad. You can never be a vampire!\"</p><p>\"Why not?\" Steve asked. He had started to cry.</p><p>\"Because vampires are not the evil monsters of lore,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"We respect life. You have a killer's instincts, but we are not killers.</p><p>\"I will not make you a vampire,\" Mr. Crepsley insisted. \"You must forget about it. Go home and get on with your life.\"</p><p>\"No!\" Steve screamed. \"I won't forget!\" He stumbled to his feet and pointed a shaking ringer at the tall, ugly vampire. \"I'll get you for this,\" he promised. \"I don't care how long it takes. One day, Vur Horston, I'll track you down and kill you for rejecting me!\"</p><p>Steve jumped from the stage and ran toward the exit. \"One day!\" he called back over his shoulder, and I could hear him laughing as he ran, a crazy kind of laugh.</p><p>Then he was gone and I was alone with the vampire.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley sat where he was for a long time, his head between his hands, spitting blood out onto the stage. He wiped his teeth with his fingers, then with a large handkerchief.</p><p>\"Children!\" he snorted aloud, then stood, still wiping his teeth, glanced one last time out over the chairs at the theater (I ducked down low for fear he might spot me), then turned and walked back to the wings. I could see drops of blood dripping from his lips as he went.</p><p>I stayed where I was for a long, long time. It was tough. I'd never been as scared as I was up there on the balcony. I wanted to rush out of the theater as fast as my feet would carry me.</p><p>But I stayed. I made myself wait until I was sure none of the freaks or helpers were around, then slowly crept back up the balcony, down the stairs, into the corridor, and finally out into the night.</p><p>I stood outside the theater for a few seconds, staring up at the moon, studying the trees until I was sure there were no vampires lurking on any of the branches. Then, as quietly as I could, I raced for home. My home, not Steve's. I didn't want to be near Steve right then. I was almost as scared of Steve as I was of Mr. Crepsley. I mean, he wanted to be a vampire! What sort of lunatic actually wants to be a vampire?</p><p>Chapter SIXTEEN</p><p>I DIDN'T CALL STEVE THAT Sunday. I told Mom and Dad we'd had a small argument and that was why I'd come home early. They weren't happy about it, especially my having walked home so late at night by myself. Dad said he was going to dock my allowance and was grounding me for a month. I didn't argue. The way I saw it, I was getting off lightly. Imagine what they'd have done to me if they knew about the Cirque Du Freak!</p><p>Annie loved her presents. She gobbled the candy down quickly and played with the spider for hours. She made me tell her all about the show. She wanted to know what every freak looked like and what they'd done. Her eyes went wide when I told her about the wolf-man and how he bit off a woman's hand.</p><p>\"You're joking,\" she said. \"That can't be true.\"</p><p>\"It is,\" I vowed.</p><p>\"Cross your heart?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Cross my heart.\"</p><p>\"Swear on your eyes?\"</p><p>\"I swear on my eyes,\" I promised. \"May rats gnaw them out if I'm telling a lie.\"</p><p>\"Wow!\" she gasped. \"I wish I'd been there. If you ever go again, will you take me?\"</p><p>\"Sure,\" I said, \"but I don't think the freak show comes here that often. They move around a lot.\"</p><p>I didn't tell Annie about Mr. Crepsley being a vampire or Steve wanting to become one, but I thought about the two of them all day long. I wanted to call Steve but didn't know what to say. He would be bound to ask why I didn't go back to his place, and I didn't want to tell him that I'd stayed in the theater and spied on him.</p><p>Imagine: a real-life vampire! I used to believe they were real but then my parents and teachers convinced me they weren't. So much for the wisdom of grownups!</p><p>I wondered what vampires were really like, whether they could do everything the books and movies said they could. I had seen Mr. Crepsley make a chair fly, and I'd seen him swoop down from the roof of the theater, and I'd seen him drink some of Steve's blood. What else could he do? Could he turn into a bat, into smoke, into a rat? Could you see him in a mirror? Would sunlight kill him?</p><p>As much as I thought about Mr. Crepsley, I thought just as much about Madam Octa. I wished once again that I could buy one like her, one I could control. I could join a freak show if I had a spider like that, and travel the world, having marvelous adventures.</p><p>Sunday came and went. I watched TV, helped Dad in the garden and Mom in the kitchen (part of my punishment for coming home late by myself), went for a long walk in the afternoon, and daydreamed about vampires and spiders.</p><p>Then it was Monday and time for school. I was nervous going in, not sure what I was going to say to Steve, or what he might say to me. Also, I hadn't slept much over the weekend (it's hard to sleep when you've seen a real vampire), so I was tired and groggy.</p><p>Steve was in the yard when I arrived, which was unusual. I normally got to school before him. He was standing apart from the rest of the kids, waiting for me. I took a deep breath, then walked over and leaned against the wall beside him.</p><p>\"Morning,\" I said.</p><p>\"Morning,\" he replied. There were dark circles under his eyes and I bet he'd slept even less than me the last couple of nights. \"Where did you go after the show?\" he asked.</p><p>\"I went home,\" I told him.</p><p>\"Why?\" he asked, watching me carefully.</p><p>\"It was dark outside and I wasn't looking where I was going. I took a few wrong turns and got lost. By the time I found myself somewhere familiar, I was closer to home than to your house.\"</p>","<p>I made the lie sound as convincing as possible, and I could see him trying to figure out if it was the truth or not.</p><p>\"You must have gotten into a lot of trouble,\" he said.</p><p>\"Tell me about it!\" I groaned. \"No allowance, grounded for a month, and Dad said I'm going to have to do a bunch of chores. Still,\" I said with a grin, \"it was worth it, right? I mean, was the Cirque Du Freak superb or what!\"</p><p>Steve studied me for one more moment, then decided I was telling the truth. \"Yeah,\" he said, returning my smile. \"It was great.\"</p><p>Tommy and Alan arrived and we had to tell them everything. We were pretty good actors, Steve and I. You'd never have guessed that he had spoken to a vampire on Saturday, or that I had seen him.</p><p>I could tell, as the day wore on, that things would never be quite the same between me and Steve. Even though he believed what I'd told him, part of him still doubted me. I caught him looking at me oddly from time to time, as though I was someone who had hurt him.</p><p>For my part, I didn't want to get too close to him any longer. It scared me, what he'd said to Mr. Crepsley, and what the vampire had said to him. Steve was evil, according to Crepsley. It worried me. After all, Steve was prepared to become a vampire and kill people for their blood. How could I go on being friends with someone like that?</p><p>We were chatting about Madam Octa later that afternoon. Steve and I hadn't said much about Mr. Crepsley and his spider. We were afraid to talk about him, in case we let something slip. But Tommy and Alan kept pestering us and eventually we filled them in on the act.</p><p>\"How do you think he controlled the spider?\" Tommy asked.</p><p>\"Maybe it was a fake spider,\" Alan said.</p><p>\"It wasn't a fake,\" I snorted. \"None of the freaks were fake. That was why it was so brilliant. You could tell everything was real.\"</p><p>\"So how did he control it?\" Tommy asked again.</p><p>\"Maybe the flute is magic,\" I said, \"or else Mr. Crepsley knows how to charm spiders, the way Indians can charm snakes.\"</p><p>\"But you said Mr. Tall controlled the spider, too,\" Alan said, \"when Mr. Crepsley had Madam Octa in his mouth.\"</p><p>\"Oh. Yeah. I forgot,\" I said. \"Well, I guess that means they must have used magic flutes.\"</p><p>\"They didn't use magic flutes,\" Steve said. He had been quiet most of the day, saying less than me about the show, but Steve never could resist hammering someone with facts.</p><p>\"So what did they use?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Telepathy,\" Steve answered.</p><p>\"Is that something to do with telephones?\" Alan asked.</p><p>Steve smiled, and Tommy and I laughed (although I wasn't entirely sure what ?telepathy? meant, and I bet Tommy wasn't either). \"Moron!\" Tommy chuckled, and punched Alan playfully.</p><p>\"Go on, Steve,\" I said, \"tell him what it means.\"</p><p>\"Telepathy is when you can read somebody else's mind,\" Steve explained, \"or send them thoughts without speaking. That's how they controlled the spider, with their minds.\"</p><p>\"So what's with the flutes?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Either they're just for show,\" Steve said, \"or, more likely, you need them to attract her attention.\"</p><p>\"You mean anyone could control her?\" Tommy asked.</p><p>\"Anyone with a brain, yes,\" Steve said. \"Which counts you out, Alan,\" he added, but smiled to show he didn't mean it.</p><p>\"You wouldn't need magic flutes or special training or anything?\" Tommy asked.</p><p>\"I don't think so,\" Steve answered.</p><p>The talk moved on to something else after that soccer, I think but I wasn't listening. Because all of a sudden there was a new thought running through my mind, setting my brain on fire with ideas. I forgot about Steve and vampires and everything.</p><p>\"You mean anyone could control her?\"</p><p>\"Anyone with a brain, yes.\"</p><p>\"You wouldn't need magic flutes or special training or anything?\"</p><p>\"I don't think so.\"</p><p>Tommy's and Steve's words kept bouncing through my mind, over and over, like a stuck CD.</p><p>Anyone could control her. That anyone could be me. If I could get my hands on Madam Octa and communicate with her, she could be my pet and I could control her and...</p><p>No. It was foolish. Maybe I could control her, but I would never own her. She was Mr. Crepsley's and there was no way in the world that he would part with her, not for money or jewels or...</p><p>The answer hit me in a flash. A way to get her from him. A way to make her mine. Blackmail! If I threatened the vampire I could say I'd get the police after him he'd have to let me keep her.</p><p>But the thought of going face to face with Mr. Crepsley terrified me. I knew I couldn't do it. That left just one other option: I'd have to steal her!</p><p>Chapter SEVETEEN</p><p>EARLY MORNING WOULD BE THE best time to steal the spider. Having performed so late into the night, most members of the Cirque Du Freak would probably sleep in until eight or nine. I'd sneak into camp, find Madam Octa, grab her, and run. If that wasn't possible if the camp was awake I'd just return home and forget about it.</p><p>The difficult part was picking a day. Wednesday might be ideal: the last show would have played the night before, so the circus would in all likelihood have pulled out before midday and moved on to its next venue before the vampire could awake and discover the theft. But what if they left town directly after the show, in the middle of the night? Then I'd miss my big chance.</p><p>It had to be tomorrow Tuesday. That meant Mr. Crepsley would have all of Tuesday night to search for his spider for me but that was a risk I'd just have to take.</p><p>I went to bed earlier than usual. I was tired and ready to fall asleep, but was so excited, I thought I wouldn't be able to. I kissed Mom good night and hugged Dad. They thought I was trying to win my allowance back, but it was in case something happened to me at the theater and I never saw them again.</p><p>I have a radio that is also an alarm clock, and I set the alarm for five o'clock in the morning, then stuck my headphones on and plugged them into the radio. That way, I could wake up nice and early without waking anyone else.</p><p>I fell asleep quicker than I expected and slept straight through till morning. If I had any dreams, I can't remember them.</p><p>Next thing I knew, the alarm was sounding. I groaned, turned over, then sat up in bed, rubbing my eyes. I wasn't sure where I was for a few seconds, or why I was awake so early. Then I remembered the spider and the plan, and grinned happily.</p>","<p>The grin didn't last long, because I realized the alarm wasn't coming through my headphones. I must have rolled over in my sleep and pulled the cord out! I leaped across my bed and slammed the alarm off, then sat in the early morning darkness, heart pounding, listening for noises.</p><p>When I was sure my parents were still asleep, I slid out of bed and got dressed as quietly as I could. I went to the bathroom and was about to flush the toilet when I thought of the noise it would make. I yanked my hand away from the lever and wiped the sweat from my brow. They would surely have heard that! A narrow escape. I'd have to be more careful when I got to the theater.</p><p>I slipped downstairs and let myself out. The sun was coming up and it looked like it would be a bright day.</p><p>I walked quickly and sang songs to pep myself up. I was a bundle of nerves and almost turned back a dozen times. Once I actually did turn and start walking home, but then I remembered the way the spider had hung from Mr. Crepsley's jaw, and the tricks she had performed, and swung around again.</p><p>I can't explain why Madam Octa meant so much to me, or why I was placing my life in such danger to have her. Looking back, I'm no longer sure what drove me on. It was just this intense need I couldn't ignore.</p><p>The crumbling old building looked even creepier by day. I could see cracks running down the front, holes nibbled by rats and mice, spiderwebs in the windows. I shivered and hurried around to the rear. It was deserted. Empty old houses, junkyards, scrap heaps. There would be people moving around later in the day, but right then it looked like a ghost town. I didn't even see a cat or a dog.</p><p>As I'd thought, there were plenty of ways to get into the theater. There were two doors and tons of windows to choose from.</p><p>Several cars and vans were parked outside the building. I didn't spot any signs or pictures on them, but I was sure they belonged to the Cirque Du Freak. It suddenly struck me that the freaks probably slept in the vans. If Mr. Crepsley had a home in one of them, my plan was sunk.</p><p>I snuck into the theater, which felt even colder than it had on Saturday night, and tiptoed down a long corridor, then another, then another! It was like a maze back there and I started worrying about finding my way out. Maybe I should go back and bring a ball of string, so I could mark my way and...</p><p>No! It was too late for that. If I left, I'd never have the guts to return. I'd just have to remember my steps as best I could and say a little prayer when it came time to leave.</p><p>I saw no sign of any freaks, and began to think I was on a fool's errand, that they were all in the vans or in nearby hotels. I'd been searching for twenty minutes and my legs felt heavy after so much walking. Maybe I should quit and forget the crazy plan.</p><p>I was about to give up when I found a set of stairs leading down to a cellar. I paused at the top for a long time, biting my lips, wondering if I should go down. I'd seen enough horror movies to know this was the most likely spot for a vampire, but I'd also seen a bunch where the hero walked down to a similar cellar, only to be attacked, murdered, and chopped up into little pieces!</p><p>Finally I took a deep breath and started down. My shoes were making too much noise, so I eased them off and padded along in just my socks. I picked up a bunch of splinters, but was so nervous, I didn't feel the pain.</p><p>There was a huge cage near the bottom of the stairs. I edged over to it and looked through the bars. The wolf-man was inside, lying on his back, asleep and snoring. He twitched and moaned as I watched. I jumped back from the cage. If he woke, his howls would bring the whole freak show down on me in seconds flat!</p><p>As I was stumbling backward, my foot hit something soft and slimy. I turned my head slowly and saw I was standing over the snake-boy! He was stretched out on the floor, his snake wrapped around him, and his eyes were wide open!</p><p>I don't know how I managed not to scream or faint, but somehow I kept quiet and stayed on my feet, and that saved me. Because, even though the snake-boy's eyes were open, he was fast asleep. I knew by the way he was breathing: deeply, heavily, in and out.</p><p>I tried not to think about what would have happened if I'd fallen on him and the snake and woken them up.</p><p>Enough was enough. I gave one last look around the dark cellar, promising myself I'd leave if I didn't spot the vampire. For a few seconds I saw nothing and got ready to scram, but then I noticed what might have been a large box near one of the walls.</p><p>It might have been a large box. But it wasn't. I knew all too well what it really was. It was a coffin!</p><p>I gulped, then walked carefully over to the coffin. It was about six feet long and two and a half feet wide. The wood was dark and stained. Moss was growing in patches, and I could see a family of cockroaches in one of the corners.</p><p>I'd love to say I was brave enough to lift the lid and peek inside, but of course I wasn't and didn't. Even the thought of touching the coffin gave me the shivers!</p><p>I searched for Madam Octa's cage. I felt sure she wouldn't be far from her master, and sure enough, there was the cage, on the floor by the head of the coffin, covered by a big red cloth.</p><p>I glanced inside to make sure, and there she was, her belly pulsing, her eight legs twitching. She looked horrible and terrifying this close up, and for a second I thought about leaving her. All of a sudden it seemed like a stupid idea, and the thought of touching her hairy legs or letting her anywhere near my face filled me with dread.</p><p>But only a true coward would turn back now. So I picked up the cage and laid it in the middle of the cellar. The key was hanging from the lock and one of the flutes was tied to the bars at the side.</p><p>I took out the note I had written back home the night before. It was simple, but had taken me forever to write. I read it as I stuck it to the top of the coffin with a piece of gum.</p><p>Mr Crepsley,</p><p>I know who and what you are. I have taken Madam Octa and am keeping her. Do not come looking for her. Do not come back to this town If you do, I will tell everyone that you are a vampire and you will be hunted down and killed I am not Steve. Steve knows nothing about this I will take good care of the spider.</p><p>Of course, I didn't sign it!</p><p>Mentioning Steve probably wasn't a good idea, but I was sure the vampire would think of him anyway, so it was just as well to clear his name.</p><p>With the note stuck in place, it was time to go. I picked up the cage and hurried up the stairs as fast as I could (being as silent as possible). I slipped my shoes back on and found my way out. It was easier than I'd imagined: the halls looked brighter after the dark of the cellar. When I got outside I walked slowly around to the front of the theater, then ran for home, stopping for nothing, leaving the theater and the vampire and my fear far behind. Leaving everything behind except for Madam Octa!</p>","<p>Chapter EIGHTEEN</p><p>I MADE IT BACK ABOUT twenty minutes before Mom and Dad got up. I hid the spider cage at the back of my closet, under a pile of clothes, leaving enough holes so Madam Octa could breathe. She should be safe there: Mom left cleaning up the room to me, and hardly ever came in snooping around.</p><p>I slipped into bed and pretended to be asleep. Dad called me at quarter to eight. I put on my school clothes and walked downstairs, yawning and stretching like I'd just gotten up. I ate breakfast quickly and hurried back upstairs to check on Madam Octa. She hadn't moved since I'd stolen her. I gave the cage a small shake but she didn't budge.</p><p>I would have liked to have stayed home and kept an eye on her but that was impossible. Mom always knows when I fake being sick. She's too smart to be fooled.</p><p>That day felt like a week. The seconds seemed to drag like hours, and even break and lunchtime went slowly! I tried playing soccer but my heart wasn't in it. I couldn't concentrate in class and kept giving stupid answers, even to simple questions.</p><p>Finally it ended and I was able to rush home and up to my room.</p><p>Madam Octa was in the same spot as earlier. I was half-afraid she was dead, but I could see her breathing. Then it struck me: she was waiting to be fed! I'd seen spiders this way before. They could sit still for hours at a time, waiting for their next meal to come along.</p><p>I wasn't sure what I should feed her, but I guessed it wasn't too different from what ordinary spiders ate. I hurried out into the garden, pausing only to snatch an empty jelly jar from the kitchen.</p><p>It didn't take long to collect a couple of dead flies, a few bugs, and a long wriggly worm. Then I raced back inside, hiding the jelly jar inside my T-shirt, so Mom couldn't see it and start asking questions.</p><p>I closed my bedroom door and stuck a chair against it so nobody could come in, then placed Madam Octa's cage on my bed and removed the cloth.</p><p>The spider squinted and crouched down lower at the sudden surge of light. I was about to open the door and throw the food in when I remembered I was dealing with a poisonous spider who could kill me with a couple of bites.</p><p>I lifted the jar over the cage, picked out one of the live insects, and dropped it. It landed on its back. Its feet twitched in the air and then it managed to roll over onto its belly. It began crawling toward freedom but didn't get far.</p><p>As soon as it moved, Madam Octa pounced. One second she was standing still as a cocoon in the middle of the cage, the next she was over the insect, baring her fangs.</p><p>She swallowed the bug down quick. It would have fed a normal spider for a day or two, but to Madam Octa it was no more than a light snack. She made her way back to her original spot and looked at me as if to say, \"Okay, that was nice. Now where's the main course?\"</p><p>I fed her the entire contents of the jar. The worm put up a good fight, twisting and turning madly, but she got her fangs into it and ripped it in half, then into quarters. She seemed to enjoy the worm the most.</p><p>I had an idea and grabbed my diary from underneath my mattress. My diary is my most prized possession, and it's because I wrote everything down in it that I'm able to write this book. I remember most of the story anyway, but whenever I get stuck, all I have to do is open the diary and check the facts.</p><p>I folded the diary open to the back page, then wrote down all that I knew about Madam Octa: what Mr. Crepsley had said about her in the show, the tricks she knew, the food she liked. I put one checkmark beside food she liked a lot, and two checkmarks beside food she loved (so far, only the worm). This way I'd be able to figure out the best way to feed her, and what to give her as a treat when I wanted her to do a trick.</p><p>I brought up some grub from the fridge next: cheese, ham, lettuce, and roast beef. She ate just about everything I gave her. It looked like I was going to be kept busy trying to feed this ugly lady!</p><p>Tuesday night was horrible. I wondered what Mr. Crepsley would think when he woke and found his spider missing and a note in its place. Would he leave like I told him, or would he come looking for his pet? Maybe, since the two of them could speak with each other telepathically, he would be able to trace her here!</p><p>I spent hours sitting up in bed, holding a cross to my chest. I wasn't sure if the cross would work or not. I know they work in the movies but I remembered talking to Steve once and he said a cross was no good by itself. He said they only worked if the person using them was good.</p><p>I finally fell asleep about two in the morning. If Mr. Crepsley had come, I would have been completely defenseless, but luckily, when I woke in the morning there was no sign of his having come, and Madam Octa was still resting in the closet.</p><p>I felt a lot better that Wednesday, especially when I popped by the old theater after school and saw the Cirque Du Freak had left. The cars and vans were gone. No trace of the freak show remained.</p><p>I'd done it! Madam Octa was mine!</p><p>I celebrated by buying a pizza. Ham and pepperoni. Mom and Dad wanted to know what the special occasion was. I said I just felt like something different and offered them and Annie a slice, and they left it at that.</p><p>I fed the scraps to Madam Octa and she loved them. She ran around the cage licking up every last crumb. I made a note in my diary: \"For a special treat, a piece of pizza!\"</p><p>I spent the next couple of days getting her used to her new home. I didn't let her out of the cage, but I carried it around the room so she could see every corner and get to know the place. I didn't want her to be nervous when I finally freed her.</p><p>I talked to her all the time, telling her about my life and family and home. I told her how much I admired her and the kind of food I was going to get her and the type of tricks we were going to do. She might not have understood everything I said, but she seemed to.</p><p>I went to the library after school on Thursday and Friday and read as much about spiders as I could find. There was all sorts of stuff I hadn't known. Like they can have up to eight eyes, and the threads of their webs are gluey fluids that harden when they're let out into the air. But none of the books mentioned performing spiders, or ones with telepathic powers. And I couldn't find any pictures of spiders like Madam Octa. It looked like none of the people who wrote these books had seen a spider like her. She was unique!</p><p>When Saturday came, I decided it was time to let her out of her cage and try a few tricks. I had practiced with the flute and could play a few very simple tunes quite well. The hard part was sending thoughts to Madam Octa while playing. It was going to be tricky, but I felt I was up to it.</p>","<p>I closed my door and shut my windows. It was Saturday afternoon. Dad was working and Mom had gone to the mall with Annie. I was all alone, so if anything went wrong it would be entirely my fault, and I would be the only one to suffer.</p><p>I placed the cage in the middle of the floor. I hadn't fed Madam Octa since the night before. I figured she might not want to perform if she was full of food. Animals can be lazy, just like humans.</p><p>I removed the cloth, put the flute in my mouth, turned the key, and opened the tiny door to the cage. I stepped back and squatted down low, so she could see me.</p><p>Madam Octa did nothing for a while. Then she crept to the door, paused, and sniffed the air. She looked too fat to squeeze through the gap, and I began to think I must have overfed her. But somehow she managed to suck her sides in and ease out.</p><p>She sat on the carpet in front of the cage, her big round belly throbbing. I thought she might walk around the cage to check the room out, but she didn't show the faintest sign of having any interest in the room.</p><p>Her eyes were glued to me!</p><p>I gulped loudly and tried not to let her sense my fear. It was difficult but I managed not to shake or cry. The flute had slipped about an inch from my lips while</p><p>I was watching her but I was still holding it. It was time to start playing, so I pressed it back between my lips and prepared to blow.</p><p>That was when she made her move. In one giant leap, she sprang across the room. She flew forward, up into the air, jaws open, fangs ready, hairy legs twitching straight at my unprotected face!</p><p>Chapter NINETEEN</p><p>IF SHE HAD CONNECTED, she would have sunk her fangs into me and I would have died. But luck was on my side, and instead of landing on flesh, she slammed against the end of the flute and went flying off to the side.</p><p>She landed in a ball and was dazed for a couple of seconds. Reacting rapidly, aware that my life depended on speed, I stuck the flute between my lips and played like a madman. My mouth was dry but I blew regardless, not daring to lick my lips.</p><p>Madam Octa cocked her head when she heard the music. She struggled to her legs and swayed from side to side, as though drunk. I sneaked a quick breath, then started playing a slower tune, which wouldn't tire my fingers or lungs.</p><p>\"Hello, Madam Octa,\" I said inside my head, shutting my eyes and concentrating. \"My name's Darren Shan. I've told you that before but I don't know if you heard. I'm not even sure if you can hear it now.</p><p>\"I'm your new owner. I'm going to treat you real good and feed you loads of insects and meat. But only if you are good and do everything I tell you and don't attack me again.\"</p><p>She had stopped swaying and was staring at me. I wasn't sure if she was listening to my thoughts or planning her next leap.</p><p>\"I want you to stand on your back legs now,\" I told her. \"I want you to stand on your two back legs and take a little bow.\"</p><p>For a few seconds she didn't respond. I went on playing and thinking, asking her to stand, then commanding her, then begging her. Finally, when I was almost out of breath, she raised herself and stood on two legs, the way I wanted. Then she took a little bow and relaxed, awaiting my next order.</p><p>She was obeying me!</p><p>The next order I gave was for her to crawl back into her cage. She did as I told, and this time I only had to think it once. As soon as she was inside, I closed the door and fell back on my butt, letting the flute fall from my mouth.</p><p>The shock I'd gotten when she jumped at me! My heart was beating so fast, I was afraid it was going to run up my neck and leap out of my mouth! I lay on the floor for a long time, staring at the spider, thinking about how close to death I had come.</p><p>That should have been warning enough. Any sensible person would have left the door shut and forgot about playing with such a deadly pet. It was too dangerous. What if she hadn't hit the flute? What if Mom had come home and found me dead on the floor? What if the spider then attacked her or Dad or Annie? Only the world's dumbest person would run a risk like that again.</p><p>Step forward Darren Shan!</p><p>It was crazy, but I couldn't stop myself. Besides, the way I saw it, there was no point having stolen her if I was going to keep her locked up in a silly old cage.</p><p>I was a little smarter this time. I unlocked the door but didn't open it. Instead I played the flute and told her to push it open. She did, and when she came out she seemed as harmless as a kitten and did everything I'd communicated.</p><p>I made her do lots of tricks. Made her hop around the room like a kangaroo. Then had her hang from the ceiling and draw pictures with her webs. Next I got her lifting weights (a pen, a box of matches, a marble). After that I told her to sit in one of my remote control cars. I turned it on and it looked like she was driving! I crashed it into a pile of books, but made her jump off at the last moment, so she wasn't hurt.</p><p>I played with her for about an hour and would have happily continued all afternoon, but I heard Mom arriving home and knew she would think it was strange if I stayed up in my room all day. The last thing I wanted was her or Dad prying into my private affairs.</p><p>So I stuck Madam Octa back in the closet and ran downstairs, trying to look as natural as possible.</p><p>\"Were you playing a CD up there?\" Mom asked. She had four bags full of clothes and hats, which she and Annie were unpacking on the kitchen table.</p><p>\"No,\" I said.</p><p>\"I thought I heard music,\" she said.</p><p>\"I was playing a flute,\" I told her, trying to sound casual.</p><p>She stopped unpacking. \"You?\" she asked. \"Playing a flute?\"</p><p>\"I do know how to play one,\" I said. \"You taught me when I was five years old, remember?\"</p><p>\"I remember.\" She laughed. \"I also remember when you were six and told me flutes were for girls. You swore you were never going to look at one again!\"</p><p>I shrugged as though it was no big thing. \"I changed my mind,\" I said. \"I found a flute on the way home from school yesterday and got to wondering if I could still play.\"</p><p>\"Where did you find it?\" she asked.</p><p>\"On the road.\"</p><p>\"I hope you washed it out before you put it in your mouth. There's no telling where it might have been.\"</p><p>\"I washed it,\" I lied.</p><p>\"This is a wonderful surprise.\" She smiled, then ruffled my hair and gave my cheek a big wet kiss.</p><p>\"Hey! Quit it! \"I yelled.</p><p>\"We'll make a Mozart out of you yet,\" she said. \"I can see it now: you playing a piano in a huge concert hall, dressed in a beautiful white suit, your father and I in the front row...\"</p>","<p>\"Get real, Mom.\" I chuckled. \"It's only a flute.\"</p><p>\"From small acorns, oak trees grow,\" she said.</p><p>\"He's as thick as an oak tree,\" Annie said, and giggled.</p><p>I stuck my tongue out at her in response.</p><p>The next few days were great. I played with Madam Octa whenever I could, feeding her every afternoon (she only needed one meal a day, as long as it was a large one). And I didn't have to worry about locking my bedroom door because Mom and Dad agreed not to enter when they heard me practicing the flute.</p><p>I considered telling Annie about Madam Octa but decided to wait a while longer. I was getting along well with the spider but could tell she was still uneasy around me. I wouldn't bring Annie in until I was sure it was completely safe.</p><p>My schoolwork improved during the next week, and so did my goal-scoring. I scored twenty-eight goals between Monday and Friday. Even Mr. Dalton was impressed.</p><p>\"With your good grades in class and your prowess on the field,\" he said, \"you could turn into the world's first professional soccer player-cum-university professor! A cross between Pele and Einstein!\"</p><p>I knew he was only pulling my leg, but it was nice of him to say it all the same.</p><p>It took a long time to work up the nerve to let Madam Octa climb up my body and over my face, but I finally tried it on Friday afternoon. I played my best song and didn't let her start until I'd told her several times what I wanted her to do. When I thought we were ready, I gave her the nod and she began creeping up the leg of my pants.</p><p>It was fine until she reached my neck. The feel of those long thin hairy legs almost caused me to drop the flute. I would have been a dead duck if I had, because she was in the perfect place to sink her fangs. Luckily, my nerve held and I went on playing.</p><p>She crawled over my left ear and up to the top of my head, where she lay down for a rest. My scalp itched beneath her but I had enough sense not to try scratching it. I studied myself in the mirror and grinned. She looked like one of those French hats, a beret.</p><p>I made her slide down my face and dangle from my nose on one of her web-strings. I didn't let her into my mouth, but I got her to swing from side to side like she'd done with Mr. Crepsley, and had her tickle my chin with her legs.</p><p>I didn't let her tickle me too much, in case I started laughing and dropped the flute!</p><p>When I put her back in her cage that Friday night, I felt like a king, like nothing could ever go wrong, that my whole life was going to be perfect. I was doing well in school and at soccer, and had the kind of pet any boy would trade all his worldly goods for. I couldn't have been happier if I'd won the lottery or a chocolate factory.</p><p>That, of course, was when everything went wrong and the whole world crashed down around my ears.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY</p><p>STEVE POPPED OVER FOR A VISIT late Saturday afternoon. We hadn't said much to each other all week and he was the last person I was expecting. Mom let him in and called me downstairs. I saw him when I was halfway down, paused, then shouted for him to come up.</p><p>He gazed around my room as though he hadn't been there for months. \"I'd almost forgotten what this place looks like,\" he said.</p><p>\"Don't be silly,\" I said. \"You were here a couple of weeks ago.\"</p><p>\"It seems longer.\" He sat on the bed and turned his eyes on me. His face was serious and lonely. \"Why have you been avoiding me?\" he asked softly.</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I pretended I didn't know what he was talking about.</p><p>\"You've been steering clear of me these past two weeks,\" he said. \"It wasn't obvious at first, but each day you've been spending less time with me. You didn't even pick me when we were playing basketball in gym last Thursday.\"</p><p>\"You're not very good at basketball,\" I said. It was a lame excuse, but I couldn't think of a better one.</p><p>\"I was confused at first,\" Steve said, \"but then I figured it out. You didn't get lost the night of the freak show, did you? You stuck around, up in the balcony probably, and saw what happened between me and Vur Horston.\"</p><p>\"No, I didn't! \"I snapped.</p><p>\"No?\" he asked.</p><p>\"No,\" I lied.</p><p>\"You didn't see anything?\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"You didn't see me talking to Vur Horston?\"</p><p>\"No!\"</p><p>\"You didn't...\"</p><p>\"Look, Steve,\" I interrupted, \"whatever happened between you and Mr. Crepsley is your business. I wasn't there, didn't see it, don't know what you're talking about. Now if...\"</p><p>\"Don't lie to me, Darren,\" he said.</p><p>\"I'm not lying!\" I lied.</p><p>\"Then how did you know I was talking about Mr. Crepsley?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Because...\" I bit my tongue.</p><p>\"I said I was talking to Vur Horston.\" Steve smiled. \"Unless you were there, how would you know that Vur Horston and Larten Crepsley are one and the same?\"</p><p>My shoulders sagged. I sat on the bed beside Steve. \"Okay,\" I said, \"I admit it. I was in the balcony.\"</p><p>\"How much did you see and hear?\" Steve asked.</p><p>\"Everything. I couldn't see what he was doing when he was sucking out your blood, or hear what he was saying. But apart from that...\"</p><p>\"Everything,\" Steve finished with a sigh. \"That's why you've been avoiding me: because he said I was evil.\"</p><p>\"Partly,\" I said. \"But mostly because of what you said. Steve, you asked him to turn you into a vampire! What if he had turned you into one and you'd come after me? Most vampires go after people they know first, don't they?\"</p><p>\"In books and movies, yes,\" Steve said. \"This is different. This is real life. I wouldn't have hurt you, Darren.\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\" I said. \"Maybe not. The point is, I don't want to find out. I don't want to be friends with you anymore. You could be dangerous. What if you met another vampire and this one granted your wish? Or what if Mr. Crepsley was right and you're really evil and...\"</p><p>\"I'm not evil!\" Steve shouted, and shoved me back on the bed. He leaped on my chest and stuck his fingers in my face. \"Take that back!\" he roared. \"Take that back, or so help me, I'll jerk your head off and...\"</p><p>\"I take it back! I take it back!\" I shrieked. Steve was heavy on my chest, his face flushed and furious. I would have said anything to get him off.</p>","<p>He sat perched on my chest a few seconds longer, then grunted and rolled off. I sat up, gasping, rubbing my face where he had poked it.</p><p>\"Sorry,\" Steve mumbled. \"That was over the top. But I'm upset. It hurt, what Mr. Crepsley said, and you ignoring me at school. You're my best friend, Darren, the only person I can really talk to. If you break up our friendship, I don't know what I'll do.\"</p><p>He started to cry. I watched him for a few seconds, torn between fear and sympathy. Then my nobler self got the better of me and I put an arm around his shoulder. \"It's okay,\" I said. \"I'll still be your friend. C'mon, Steve, quit crying, okay?\"</p><p>He tried but it took a while for the tears to stop. \"I must look like a total fool,\" he finally sniffed.</p><p>\"No,\" I said. \"I'm the fool. I should have stood by you. I was a coward. I never stopped to imagine what you must be going through. I was only thinking of myself and Madam...\" I made a face and stopped talking.</p><p>Steve stared at me curiously. \"What were you going to say?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Nothing,\" I said. \"It was a slip of the tongue.\"</p><p>He grunted. \"You're a bad liar, Shan. Always were. Tell me what it was you were about to let slip.\"</p><p>I studied his face, wondering if I should tell him. I knew I shouldn't, that it could only mean trouble, but I felt sorry for him. Besides, I needed to tell someone. I wanted to show off my wonderful pet and the great tricks we could do.</p><p>\"Can you keep a secret?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Of course,\" he snorted.</p><p>\"This is a big one. You can't tell anyone, okay? If I tell you, it has to stay between the two of us. If you ever talk...\"</p><p>\"You'll talk about me and Mr. Crepsley,\" Steve said, grinning. \"You have me over a barrel. No matter what you tell me, you know I can't blab, even if I wanted to. What's the big secret?\"</p><p>\"Wait a minute,\" I said. I got off the bed and opened the door to the room. \"Mom?\" I shouted.</p><p>\"Yes?\" came her muffled reply.</p><p>\"I'm showing Steve my flute,\" I yelled. \"I'm going to teach him how to play it, but only if we're not disturbed, okay?\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" she called back.</p><p>I closed the door and smiled at Steve. He looked puzzled. \"A flute?\" he asked. \"Your big secret is a flute?\"</p><p>\"That's part of it,\" I said. \"Listen, do you remember Madam Octa? Mr. Crepsley's spider?\"</p><p>\"Of course,\" he said. \"I wasn't paying much attention to her when she was on but I don't think anyone could ever forget a creature like that. Those hairy legs: brrrr!\"</p><p>I opened the door to the closet while he was speaking and got out the cage. His eyes squinted when he saw it, then widened. \"That's not what I think it is, is it?\" he asked.</p><p>\"That depends,\" I said, whipping off the cloth. \"If you think it's a deadly performing spider you're right!\"</p><p>\"Oh man!\" he gasped, almost falling off the bed in shock. \"That's a...she's a...where did...Wow!\"</p><p>I was delighted with his reaction. I stood over the cage, smiling like a proud father. Madam Octa lay on the floor, quiet as ever, paying no attention to me or Steve.</p><p>\"She's awesome!\" Steve said, crawling closer for a better look. \"She looks just the same as the one in the circus. I can't believe you found one that looks so similar. Where'd you get her? A pet shop? From a zoo?\"</p><p>My smile slipped. \"I got her from the Cirque Du Freak, of course,\" I said uneasily.</p><p>\"From the freak show?\" he asked, face crinkling. \"They were selling live spiders? I didn't see any. How much did she cost?\"</p><p>I shook my head and said: \"I didn't buy her, Steve. I...Can't you guess? Don't you understand?\"</p><p>\"Understand what?\" he asked.</p><p>\"That's not a similar spider,\" I said. \"That's the same one. It's Madam Octa.\"</p><p>He stared at me, as though he hadn't heard what I'd said. I was about to repeat it, but he spoke up before I could. \"The...same...one?\" he asked in a slow, trembling voice.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said.</p><p>\"You mean...that's...Madam Octa? The Madam Octa?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said again, laughing at his shock.</p><p>\"That's...Mr. Crepsley's spider?\"</p><p>\"Steve, what's wrong? How many times do I have to say it for you to...\"</p><p>\"Wait a minute,\" he snapped, shaking his head. \"If this is really Madam Octa, how did you get your hands on her? Did you find her outside? Did they sell her off?\"</p><p>\"Nobody would sell a great spider like this,\" I said.</p><p>\"That's what I thought,\" Steve agreed. \"So how did...\" He left the question hanging in the air.</p><p>\"I stole her,\" I said, puffing up proudly. \"I went back to the theater that Tuesday morning, crept in, found where she was, and snuck out with her. I left a note telling Mr. Crepsley not to come looking for her or I'd report his being a vampire to the police.\"</p><p>\"You...you...\" Steve was gasping. His face had turned white and he looked like he was about to collapse.</p><p>\"Are you all right?\" I asked.</p><p>\"You...imbecile!\" he roared. \"You lunatic! You moron!\"</p><p>\"Hey!\" I shouted, upset.</p><p>\"Idiot! Dumbo! Cretin!\" he yelled. \"Do you realize what you've done? Do you have any idea what kind of trouble you're in?\"</p><p>\"Huh? \"I asked, bewildered.</p><p>\"You stole a vampire's spider!\" Steve shouted. \"You stole from a member of the undead! What do you think he's going to do when he catches up with you, Darren? Spank your bottom and scold you? Tell your parents and make them ground you? We're talking about a vampire! He'll rip out your throat and feed you to the spider! He'll tear you to pieces and...\"</p><p>\"No, he won't,\" I said calmly.</p><p>\"Of course he will,\" Steve replied.</p><p>\"No,\" I said, \"he won't. Because he won't find me. I stole the spider the Tuesday before last, so he's had nearly two whole weeks to track me down, but there hasn't been a sign of him. He left with the circus and won't ever come back, not if he knows what's good for him.\"</p><p>\"I dunno,\" Steve said. \"Vampires have long memories. He might return when you're grown up and have kids of your own.\"</p>","<p>\"I'll worry about that when and if it happens,\" I said. \"I've gotten away with it for the time being. I wasn't sure I would I thought he'd track me down and kill me but I did. So quit with the names, all right?\"</p><p>\"You're something else.\" He laughed, shaking his head. \"I thought I was daring, but stealing a vampire's pet! I never would have thought you had it in you. What made you do it?\"</p><p>\"I had to have her,\" I told him. \"I saw her onstage and knew I'd do anything to get her. Then I discovered Mr. Crepsley was a vampire and realized I could blackmail him. It's wrong, I know, but he's a vampire, so it's not too bad, is it? Stealing from someone bad in a way it's a good thing, right?\"</p><p>Steve laughed. \"I don't know if it's good or bad,\" he said. \"All I know is, if he ever comes looking for her, I wouldn't want to be in your shoes.\"</p><p>He studied the spider again. He stuck his face up close to the cage (but not close enough for her to strike him) and watched her belly bulging in and out.</p><p>\"Have you let her out of the cage yet?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Every day,\" I said. I picked up the flute and gave a toot. Madam Octa jumped forward a couple of centimeters. Steve yelped and fell back on his butt. I howled with laughter.</p><p>\"You can control her?\" he gasped.</p><p>\"I can make her do everything Mr. Crepsley did,\" I said, trying not to sound boastful. \"It's really easy. She's perfectly safe as long as you concentrate. But if you let your thoughts wander for even a second...\" I drew a finger across my throat and made a choking noise.</p><p>\"Have you let her make a web over your lips?\" Steve asked. His eyes were shining brightly.</p><p>\"Not yet,\" I said. \"I'm worried about letting her in my mouth: the thought of her slipping down my throat terrifies me. Besides, I'd need a partner to control her while she spun the web, and so far I've been alone.\"</p><p>\"So far.\" Steve grinned. \"But not anymore.\" He got up and clapped his hands. \"Let's do it. Teach me how to use that fancy tin whistle and let me at her. I'm not afraid to let her in my mouth. C'mon, let's go, let's go, let's go go go go GO!\"</p><p>I couldn't ignore excitement like that. I knew it was unwise to involve Steve with the spider on such short notice I should have made sure he got to know her better but I ignored common sense and gave in to his wishes.</p><p>I told him he couldn't play the flute, not until he'd practiced, but he could play with Madam Octa while I was controlling her. I ran him through the tricks we were going to do and made sure he understood everything.</p><p>\"Being quiet is vital,\" I said. \"Don't say anything.</p><p>Don't even whistle loudly. Because if you disturb my attention and I lose control of her...\"</p><p>\"Yeah, yeah,\" Steve sighed. \"I know. Don't worry. I can be quiet as a mouse when I want.\"</p><p>When he was ready, I unlocked Madam Octa's cage and began playing. She moved forward at my order. I could hear Steve drawing in his breath, a little scared now that she was out in the open, but he gave no sign that he wanted to stop, so I went on blowing and started her off on her routine.</p><p>I let her do a lot of stuff by herself before allowing her near Steve. We'd developed a great understanding over the last week or so. The spider had grown used to my mind and the way it thought, and had learned to obey my commands almost before I finished sending them. I'd learned that she could work from the shortest of instructions: I only had to use a few words to prompt her into action.</p><p>Steve watched the show in total silence. He almost clapped a few times but caught himself before his hands could meet and produce a noise. Instead of clapping, he gave me the thumbs-up sign and mouthed the words \"great.\" \"super.\" \"awesome,\" and so on.</p><p>When the time came for Steve to take part in the act, I gave him the nod that we had agreed upon. He gulped, took a deep breath, then nodded back. He rose to his feet and stepped forward, keeping to the side so I wouldn't lose sight of Madam Octa. Then he sank to his knees and waited.</p><p>I played a new tune and sent a new set of orders. Madam Octa sat still, listening. When she knew what I wanted, she started creeping toward Steve. I saw him shivering and licking his lips. I was going to cancel the act and send the spider back to her cage, but then he stopped shaking and became calmer, so I continued.</p><p>He gave a small shudder when she started crawling up the leg of his pants, but that was a natural response. I still got the shakes sometimes when I felt her hairy legs brushing against my skin.</p><p>I made Madam Octa crawl up the back of his neck and tickle his ears with her legs. He giggled softly and the last traces of his fear vanished. I felt more confident now that he was calmer, so I moved the spider around to the front of his face, where she built small cobwebs over his eyes and slid down his nose and bounced off his lips.</p><p>Steve was enjoying it and so was I. There were lots of new things I was able to do now that I had a partner.</p><p>She was on his right shoulder, preparing to slide down his arm, when the door opened and Annie walked in.</p><p>Normally Annie never enters my room before knocking. She's a great kid, not like other brats her age, and almost always knocks politely and waits for a reply. But that evening, by sheer bad luck, she happened to barge in.</p><p>\"Hey, Darren, where's my...\" she started to say, then stopped. She saw Steve and the monstrous spider on his shoulder, its fangs glinting as though getting ready to bite, and she did the natural thing.</p><p>She screamed.</p><p>The sound alarmed me. My head turned, the flute slid from my lips, and my concentration snapped. My link to Madam Octa disintegrated. She shook her head, took a couple of quick steps closer to Steve's throat, then bared her fangs and appeared to grin.</p><p>Steve roared with fear and surged to his feet. He swiped at the spider, but she ducked and his hand missed. Before he could try again, Madam Octa lowered her head, quick as a snake, and sank her poison-tipped fangs deep into his neck!</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-ONE</p><p>STEVE STIFFENED AS SOON as the spider bit him. His yells stopped dead in his throat, his lips turned blue, his eyes snapped wide open. For what seemed an eternity (though it couldn't have been more than three or four seconds), he tottered on his feet. Then he crumpled to the floor like a scarecrow.</p><p>The fall saved him. As with the goat at the Cirque Du Freak show, Madam Octa's first bite knocked Steve out, but didn't kill him right away. I saw her moving along his neck before he fell, searching for the right spot, preparing for the second, killer bite.</p>","<p>The fall disturbed her. She slipped from Steve's neck and it took her a few seconds to climb back up.</p><p>Those seconds were all I needed.</p><p>I was in a state of shock, but the sight of her emerging over his shoulder like some terrible arachnid sunrise spurred me back to life. I stooped for the flute, jammed it almost through the back of my throat, and blew the loudest note of my entire life.</p><p>\"STOP!\" I screamed inside my head, and Madam Octa leaped about two feet into the air.</p><p>\"Back inside the cage!\" I commanded, and she hopped down from Steve's body and sped across the floor. As soon as she passed the bars of the door, I lunged forward and slammed it shut.</p><p>With Madam Octa taken care of, my attention turned to Steve. Annie was still screaming but I couldn't worry about her until I'd seen to my poisoned friend.</p><p>\"Steve?\" I asked, crawling close to his ear, praying for an answer. \"Are you okay? Steve?\" There was no reply. He was breathing, so I knew he was alive, but that was all. There was nothing else he could do. He couldn't talk or move his arms. He wasn't even able to blink.</p><p>I became aware of Annie standing behind me. She'd stopped screaming but I could feel her shaking.</p><p>\"Is...is he...dead?\" she asked in a tiny voice.</p><p>\"Of course not!\" I snapped. \"You can see him breathing, can't you? Look at his belly and chest.\"</p><p>\"But...why can't he move?\" she asked.</p><p>\"He's paralyzed,\" I told her. \"The spider injected him with poison that stops his limbs. It's like putting him to sleep, except his brain's still active and he can see and hear everything.\"</p><p>I didn't know if this was true. I hoped it was. If the poison had left the heart and lungs alone, it might also have skipped his brain. But if it had gotten into his skull...</p><p>The thought was too terrible to consider.</p><p>\"Steve, I'm going to help you up,\" I said. \"I think if we move you around, the poison will wear off.\"</p><p>I stuck my arms around Steve's waist and hauled him to his feet. He was heavy but I took no notice of the weight. I dragged him around the room, shaking his arms and legs, talking to him as I went, telling him he was going to be all right, there wasn't enough poison in one bite to kill him, he would recover.</p><p>After ten minutes of this, there was no change and I was too tired to carry him any longer. I dropped him on the bed, then carefully arranged his body so he would be comfortable. His eyelids were open. His eyes looked weird and were scaring me, so I closed them, but then he looked like a corpse, so I opened them again.</p><p>\"Will he be all right?\" Annie asked.</p><p>\"Of course he will,\" I said, trying to sound positive. \"The poison will wear off after a while and he'll be fine. It's only a matter of time.\"</p><p>I don't think she believed me but she said nothing, only sat on the edge of the bed and watched Steve's face like a hawk. I began wondering why Mom hadn't been up to investigate. I crept over to the open door and listened at the top of the stairs. I could hear the washing machine rumbling in the kitchen below. That explained it: our washing machine is old and clunky. You can't hear anything over the noise it makes if you're in the kitchen and it's turned on.</p><p>Annie was no longer on the bed when I returned. She was down on the floor, studying Madam Octa.</p><p>\"It's the spider from the freak show, isn't it?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I admitted.</p><p>\"The poisonous one?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"How did you get it?\" she asked.</p><p>\"That's not important,\" I said, blushing.</p><p>\"How did she get loose?\" Annie asked.</p><p>\"I let her out,\" I said.</p><p>\"You what?!\"</p><p>\"It wasn't the first time,\" I told her. \"I've had her for almost two weeks. I've played with her lots of times. It's perfectly safe as long as there are no noises. If you hadn't come barging in when you did, she would have been...\"</p><p>\"No you don't,\" she growled. \"You aren't laying the blame on me. Why didn't you tell me about her? If I'd known, I wouldn't have come busting in.\"</p><p>\"I was going to,\" I said. \"I was waiting until I was sure it was safe. Then Steve came and...\"I couldn't continue.</p><p>I stuck the cage back in the closet, where I wouldn't have to look at Madam Octa. I joined Annie by the bed and studied Steve's motionless form. We sat silently for almost an hour, just watching.</p><p>\"I don't think he's going to recover,\" she finally said.</p><p>\"Give it more time,\" I pleaded.</p><p>\"I don't think time will help,\" she insisted. \"If he was going to recover, he should be moving a little by now.\"</p><p>\"What do you know about it?\" I asked roughly. \"You're a child. You know nothing!\"</p><p>\"That's right,\" she agreed calmly. \"But you don't know any more about it than me, do you?\" I shook my head unhappily. \"So stop pretending you do,\" she said.</p><p>She laid a hand on my arm and smiled bravely to show she wasn't trying to make me feel bad. \"We have to tell Mom,\" she said. \"We have to get her up here. She might know what to do.\"</p><p>\"And if she doesn't?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Then we have to take him to a hospital,\" Annie said.</p><p>I knew she was right. I'd known it all along. I just didn't want to admit it.</p><p>\"Let's give it another fifteen minutes,\" I said. \"If he hasn't moved by then, we call her.\"</p><p>\"Fifteen minutes?\" she asked uncertainly.</p><p>\"Not a minute more,\" I promised.</p><p>\"Okay,\" she agreed.</p><p>We sat in silence again and watched our friend. I thought about Madam Octa and how I was going to explain this to Mom. To the doctors. To the police! Would they believe me when I told them Mr. Crepsley was a vampire? I doubted it. They'd think I was lying. They might throw me in jail. They might say, since the spider was mine, I was to blame. They might charge me with murder and lock me away!</p><p>I checked my watch. Three minutes to go. No change in Steve.</p><p>\"Annie, I need to ask a favor,\" I said.</p><p>She looked at me suspiciously. \"What?\"</p><p>\"I don't want you to mention Madam Octa,\" I said.</p><p>\"Are you crazy?\" she shouted. \"How else are you going to explain what happened?\"</p>","<p>\"I don't know,\" I admitted. \"I'll tell them I was out of the room. The bite marks are tiny. They look like small bee stings and are going down all the time. The doctors might not even notice them.\"</p><p>\"We can't do that,\" Annie said. \"They might need to examine the spider. They might...\"</p><p>\"Annie, if Steve dies, I'll be blamed,\" I said softly. \"There are parts to this I can't tell you, that I can't tell anybody. All I can say is, if the worst happens, I'll be left holding the bag. Do you know what they do to murderers?\"</p><p>\"You're too young to be tried for murder,\" she said, but sounded uncertain.</p><p>\"No, I'm not,\" I told her. \"I'm too young to go to a real prison but they have special places for children. They'd hold me in one of those until I turned eighteen and then...Please, Annie.\" I started to cry. \"I don't want to go to jail.\"</p><p>She started crying, too. We held on to each other and sobbed like a couple of babies. \"I don't want them to take you away,\" she wept. \"I don't want to lose you.\"</p><p>\"Then do you promise not to tell?\" I asked. \"Will you go back to your bedroom and pretend you saw and heard none of this?\"</p><p>She nodded sadly. \"But not if I think the truth can save him,\" she added. \"If the doctors say they can't save him unless they find what bit him, I'm telling. Okay?\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" I agreed.</p><p>She got to her feet and headed for the door. She stopped in the middle of the room, turned, came back, and kissed me on the forehead. \"I love you, Darren,\" she said, \"but you were a fool to bring that spider into this house, and if Steve dies, I think you are the one who should be blamed.\"</p><p>Then she ran from the room, sobbing.</p><p>I waited a few minutes, holding Steve's hand, begging him to recover, to show some sign of life. When my prayers weren't answered, I got to my feet, opened the window (to explain how the mystery attacker got in), took a deep breath, and then ran downstairs, screaming for my mother.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-TWO</p><p>THE AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS ASKED MY mother if Steve was diabetic or epileptic. She wasn't sure but didn't think so. They also asked about allergies and everything, but she explained that she wasn't his mother and didn't know.</p><p>I thought they'd take us with them in the ambulance, but they said there wasn't room. They got Steve's phone number and the name of his mom, but she wasn't home. One of the attendants asked my mother if she'd follow them to the hospital, to fill out as many of the forms as she could, so they could make a start. She agreed and bundled me and Annie into the car. Dad still wasn't home, so she called him on his cell phone to explain where we'd be. He said he'd come right over.</p><p>That was a miserable ride. I sat in the back, trying not to meet Annie's eye, knowing I should tell the truth, but too afraid to. What made it even worse was, I knew if I was the one lying in a coma, Steve would own up immediately.</p><p>\"What happened in there?\" Mom asked over her shoulder. She was driving as fast as she could without breaking the speed limit, so she wasn't able to look back at me. I was glad: I don't think I could have lied straight to her face.</p><p>\"I'm not sure,\" I said. \"We were chatting. Then I had to go to the bathroom. When I got back...\"</p><p>\"You didn't see anything?\" she asked.</p><p>\"No,\" I lied, feeling my ears reddening with shame.</p><p>\"I can't understand it,\" she muttered. \"He felt so stiff and his skin was turning blue. I thought he was dead.\"</p><p>\"I think he was bitten,\" Annie said. I almost gave her a dig in the ribs, but at the last second remembered I was depending on her to keep my secret.</p><p>\"Bitten?\" Mom asked.</p><p>\"There were a couple of marks on his neck,\" Annie said.</p><p>\"I saw them,\" Mom said. \"But I don't think that's it, dear.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\" Annie asked. \"If a snake or a... spider got in and bit him...\" She glanced over at me and blushed a little, recalling her promise.</p><p>\"A spider?\" Mom shook her head. \"No, dear, spiders don't go around biting people and sending them into shock, not around here.\"</p><p>\"So what was it?\" Annie asked.</p><p>\"I'm not sure,\" Mom replied. \"Maybe he ate something that didn't agree with him, or had a heart attack.\"</p><p>\"Children don't have heart attacks,\" Annie retorted.</p><p>\"They do,\" Mom said. \"It's rare, but it can happen. Still, the doctors will sort all that out. They know more about these things than we do.\"</p><p>I wasn't used to hospitals, so I spent some time looking around while Mom was filling out the forms. It was the whitest place I'd ever seen: white walls, white floors, white uniforms. It wasn't very busy but there was a buzz to the place, a sound of bed springs and coughing, machines humming, doctors speaking softly.</p><p>We didn't say much while sitting there. Mom said Steve had been admitted and was being examined but it might be a while before they discovered what was wrong. \"They sounded optimistic,\" she said.</p><p>Annie was thirsty, so Mom sent me with her to get drinks from the machine around the corner. Annie glanced around while I was putting in the coins, to make sure nobody could overhear.</p><p>\"How long are you going to wait?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Until I hear what they have to say,\" I told her. \"We'll let them examine him. Hopefully they'll know what sort of poison it is and be able to cure him by themselves.\"</p><p>\"And if they can't?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Then I tell them,\" I promised.</p><p>\"What if he dies before that?\" she asked softly.</p><p>\"He won't,\" I said.</p><p>\"But what if...\"</p><p>\"He won't!\" I snapped. \"Don't talk like that. Don't even think like that. We have to hope for the best. We must believe he will pull through. Mom and Dad have always told us good thoughts help make sick people better, haven't they? He needs us to believe in him.\"</p><p>\"He needs the truth more,\" she grumbled, but let the matter drop. We took the drinks back to the couch and drank in silence.</p><p>Dad arrived not long after, still in his work clothes. He kissed Mom and Annie and squeezed my shoulder. His dirty hands left grease marks on my T-shirt, but that didn't bother me.</p><p>\"Any news?\" he asked.</p>","<p>\"None yet,\" Mom said. \"They're examining him. It could be hours before we hear anything.\"</p><p>\"What happened to him, Angela?\" Dad asked.</p><p>\"We don't know yet,\" Mom said. \"We'll have to wait and see.\"</p><p>\"I hate waiting,\" Dad grumbled, but since he had no other choice, he had to, the same as the rest of us.</p><p>Nothing else happened for a couple of hours, until Steve's mom arrived. Her face was white like Steve's, and her lips were pinched together. She made straight for me, grabbed me by the shoulders and shook me hard. \"What have you done to him?\" she screeched. \"Have you hurt my boy? Have you killed my Steve?\"</p><p>\"Hey! Stop that!\" Dad gasped.</p><p>Steve's mom ignored him. \"What have you done?\" she screamed again, and shook me even harder. I tried to say NNothing? but my teeth were clattering. \"What have you done? What have you done?\" she repeated, then suddenly stopped shaking me, let go, and collapsed to the floor, where she bawled like a baby.</p><p>Mom got off the couch and crouched beside Mrs. Leonard. She stroked the back of her head and whispered soothing words to her, then helped her up and sat down with her. Mrs. Leonard was still crying, and was now moaning about what a bad mother she'd been and how much Steve hated her.\"</p><p>\"You two go and play somewhere else,\" Mom said to Annie and me. We started away. \"Darren,\" Mom called me back. \"Don't pay attention to what she was saying. She doesn't blame you. She's just afraid.\"</p><p>I nodded miserably. What would Mom say if she knew Mrs. Leonard was right and I was to blame?</p><p>Annie and me found a couple of video games to keep us busy. I didn't think I'd be able to play but after a few minutes I forgot about Steve and the hospital and got caught up in the games. It was nice to slip away from the worries of the real world for a while, and if I hadn't run out of quarters, I might have stayed there all night.</p><p>When we returned to the waiting room, Mrs. Leonard had calmed down and was off with Mom, filling out forms, Annie and I sat and the waiting began all over again.</p><p>Annie began yawning about ten o'clock and that set me off, too. Mom took one look at us and ordered us home. I started to argue but she cut me short.</p><p>\"You can't do any good here,\" she said. \"I'll call as soon as I hear anything, even if it's the middle of the night, okay?\"</p><p>I hesitated. This would be my final chance to mention the spider. I came very close to spilling the beans, but I was tired and couldn't find the words. \"Okay,\" I said glumly, then left.</p><p>Dad drove us home. I wondered what he'd do if I told him about the spider, Mr. Crepsley, and the rest. He would have punished me, I'm sure, but that's not why I didn't tell him: I kept quiet because I knew he'd be ashamed of the way I'd lied and put my own well-being before Steve's. I was afraid he'd hate me.</p><p>Annie was asleep by the time we got home. Dad lifted her in from the backseat and took her to bed. I walked slowly up to my room and got undressed. I kept cursing myself under my breath.</p><p>Dad looked in as I was putting my clothes away. \"Will you be okay?\" he asked. I nodded. \"Steve will recover,\" he said. \"I'm sure of it. The doctors know their stuff. They'll bring him around.\"</p><p>I nodded again, not trusting myself to answer. Dad stood in the doorway a moment longer, then sighed, left, and stomped downstairs to his study.</p><p>I was hanging my pants up in the closet when I noticed Madam Octa's cage. Slowly, I pulled it out. She was lying in the middle, breathing easily, calm as ever.</p><p>I studied the colorful spider and wasn't impressed by what I saw. She was bright, yes, but ugly and hairy and nasty. I began to hate her. She was the real villain, the one who bit Steve for no good reason. I had fed her and cared for her and played with her. This was how she repaid me.</p><p>\"You stupid monster!\" I snarled, shaking the cage. \"You ungrateful creep!\"</p><p>I gave the cage another shake. Her legs gripped the bars tightly. This made me madder and I yanked the cage roughly from side to side, trying to make her lose her grip, hoping to hurt her.</p><p>I spun in a circle, whirling the cage around by the handle. I was swearing, calling her every name under the sun, wishing she was dead, wishing I'd never set eyes on her, wishing I had the guts to take her out of the cage and squeeze her to death.</p><p>Finally, as my rage reached its boiling point, I hurled the cage as far away from me as possible. I wasn't looking where I was throwing, and got a shock when I saw it sail through the open window and out into the night.</p><p>I watched it flying away, then hurried after it. I was scared it would hit the ground and break open, because I knew if the doctors weren't able to save Steve by themselves, they might be able to with the help of Madam Octa: if they studied her, they might find out how to cure him. But if she escaped...</p><p>I rushed to the window. I was too late to grab for the cage but at least I could see where it landed. I watched as it floated out and down, praying it wouldn't break. It seemed to take forever to fall.</p><p>Just before it hit the ground, a hand darted out from the shadows of the night and snatched it from the air.</p><p>A hand?!</p><p>I leaned forward quickly for a better view. It was a dark night and at first I couldn't see who was down there. But then the person stepped forward and all was revealed.</p><p>First, I saw his wrinkly hands holding the cage. Then his long red clothes. Then his cropped orange hair. Then his long ugly scar. And, finally, his sharp toothy grin.</p><p>It was Mr. Crepsley. The vampire.</p><p>And he was smiling up at me!</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-THREE</p><p>I STOOD BY THE WINDOW, expecting him to turn into a bat and come flying up, but he did nothing apart from shake the cage gently to make sure Madam Octa was all right.</p><p>Then, still smiling, he turned and walked away. Within a matter of seconds he had been swallowed from sight by the night.</p><p>I shut the window and fled to the safety of my bed, where my mind turned inside out with questions. How long had he been down there? If he knew where Madam Octa was, why hadn't he taken her before this? I thought he'd be furious, but he seemed amused. Why hadn't he ripped out my throat like Steve said he would?</p><p>Sleep was impossible. I was more terrified now than I had been the night after stealing the spider. Back then I could tell myself that he didn't know who I was and therefore couldn't find me.</p><p>I thought about telling Dad. After all, a vampire knew where we lived and had reason to bear a grudge against us. Dad should know. He should be warned and given a chance to prepare a defense. But...</p>","<p>He wouldn't believe me. Especially not now that Madam Octa was gone. I imagined trying to convince him that vampires were real, that one had been to our house and might come back. He'd think I was insane.</p><p>I was able to snooze a little when dawn rolled around, because I knew the vampire couldn't launch an attack until sunset. It wasn't much of a sleep, but even a small amount of rest did me good and I was able to think clearly when I woke. I realized, as I thought it over, that I had no reason to be afraid. If the vampire had wanted to kill me, he could have done it last night when I was unprepared. For some reason, he didn't want me dead, at least not yet.</p><p>With that worry off my mind, I could focus on Steve and my real problem: whether to reveal the truth or not. Mom had stayed at the hospital all night, taking care of Mrs. Leonard, calling around to let friends and neighbors know of Steve's illness. If she had been home, I might have told her, but the thought of telling Dad filled me with dread.</p><p>Ours was a very quiet house that Sunday. Dad cooked eggs and sausages for breakfast, and burned them as he normally does when he cooks, but we didn't complain. I hardly even tasted the food as I gulped it down. I wasn't hungry. The only reason I ate was to pretend it was any other average Sunday.</p><p>Mom called as we were finishing. She had a long talk with Dad. He didn't say much, only nodded and grunted. Annie and I sat still, trying to hear what was being said. He came in and sat down when he was finished talking.</p><p>\"How is he?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Not good,\" Dad said. \"The doctors don't know what to make of it. It seems Annie was right: it is poison. But not like any they know. They've sent samples to experts in other hospitals, and hopefully one of them will know more about it. But...\" He shook his head.</p><p>\"Will he die?\" Annie asked quietly.</p><p>\"Maybe,\" Dad said, being honest. I was glad for that. All too often adults lie to kids about serious matters. I'd rather know the truth about death than be lied to.</p><p>Annie started to cry. Dad picked her up and perched her on his lap. \"Hey, now, there's no need to cry,\" he said. \"It's not over yet. He's still alive. He's breathing and his brain doesn't seem to have been affected. If they can figure out a way to fight the poison in his body, he should be fine.\"</p><p>\"How long does he have?\" I asked.</p><p>Dad shrugged. \"The way he is, they could keep him alive for a long time with machines.\"</p><p>\"You mean like someone in a coma?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Exactly.\"</p><p>\"How long before they have to start using machines?\" I asked.</p><p>\"A few days, they think,\" Dad answered. \"They can't say for sure, seeing as how they don't know what they're dealing with, but they think it will be a couple of days before his respiratory and coronary systems begin to shut down.\"</p><p>\"His what?\" Annie asked between sobs.</p><p>\"His lungs and heart,\" Dad explained. \"As long as those are working, he's alive. They have to use a drip to feed him but otherwise he's okay. It's when if he stops breathing by himself that the trouble really begins.\"</p><p>A couple of days. It wasn't much. The day before, he'd had a whole lifetime to look forward to. Now he had a couple of days.</p><p>\"Can I go see him?\" I asked.</p><p>\"This afternoon, if you feel up to it,\" Dad said. \"I'll feel up to it,\" I vowed.</p><p>The hospital was busier this time, packed with visitors. I'd never seen so many boxes of chocolates and flowers. Everybody seemed to be carrying one or the other. I wanted to buy something for Steve at the hospital store but had no money.</p><p>I expected Steve to be in the children's ward but he was in a room by himself, because the doctors wanted to study him, and also because they weren't sure if what he had was catching. We had to wear masks and gloves and long green gowns when we entered.</p><p>Mrs. Leonard was asleep in a chair. Mom made a sign for us to be quiet. She gave us hugs, one by one, then spoke to Dad.</p><p>\"A couple of results have come in from other hospitals,\" she told him, her voice muffled by the mask. \"All negative.\"</p><p>\"Surely someone knows what this is,\" Dad said. \"How many different types of poison can there be?\"</p><p>\"Thousands,\" she said. \"They've sent specimens to foreign hospitals. Hopefully one of them will have a record of it, but it's going to be some time before they get back to us.\"</p><p>I studied Steve while they were talking. He was tucked neatly into the bed. A drip was attached to one arm, and wires and stuff to his chest. There were needle marks where doctors had taken samples of his blood. His face was white and stiff. He looked terrible!</p><p>I started crying and couldn't stop. Mom put her arms around me and hugged me tight, but that only made it worse. I tried telling her about the spider but I was crying too much for my words to be heard. Mom kept hugging and kissing and shushing me, and eventually I quit trying.</p><p>New visitors arrived, relatives of Steve's, and Mom decided to leave them alone with him and his mother. She led us out, removed my mask, and wiped the tears from my face with a tissue.</p><p>\"There,\" she said. \"That's better.\" She smiled and tickled me until I grinned back. \"He'll be okay,\" she promised. \"I know he looks bad, but the doctors are doing all they can. We have to trust them and hope for the best, okay?\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" I sighed.</p><p>\"I thought he looked pretty good,\" Annie said, squeezing my hand. I smiled thankfully at her.</p><p>\"Are you coming home now?\" Dad asked Mom.</p><p>\"I'm not sure,\" she said. \"I think I should stick around a little longer in case...\"</p><p>\"Angela, you've done enough for the time being,\" Dad said firmly. \"I bet you didn't get any sleep last night, did you?\"</p><p>\"Not much,\" Mom admitted.</p><p>\"And if you stay on now, you won't get any today either. Come on, Angie, let's go.\" Dad calls Mom ?Angie? when he's trying to sweet-talk her into something. \"There are other people who can look after Steve and his mother. Nobody expects you to do everything.\"</p><p>\"All right,\" she agreed. \"But I'm coming back tonight to see if they need me.\"</p><p>\"Fair enough,\" he said, and led the way out to the car. It hadn't been much of a visit but I didn't complain. I was glad to get away.</p><p>I thought about Steve as we drove home, how he looked and why he looked that way. I thought about the poison in his veins and felt pretty sure the doctors would fail to cure it. I bet no doctor in the world had ever come across poison from a spider like Madam Octa before.</p>","<p>However bad Steve had looked, I knew he'd look a lot worse after another couple of days. I imagined him hooked up to a breathing machine, his face covered with a mask, tubes sticking into him. It was a horrible thought.</p><p>There was only one way to save Steve. Only one person who might know about the poison and how to beat it.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>As we pulled into the driveway back home and got out of the car, I made up my mind: I was going to track him down and make him do what he could to help Steve. As soon as it got dark, I'd sneak out and find the vampire, wherever he might be. And if I couldn't force it out of him and come back with a cure...</p><p>...I wouldn't come back at all.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL ALMOST eleven o'clock. I would have gone earlier, while Mom was at the hospital, but a couple of Dad's pals came around with kids of their own and I had to play host.</p><p>Mom returned home at about ten. She was tired, so Dad quickly cleared the house of visitors. They had a cup of tea and a chat in the kitchen, then went up to bed. I let them drift off to sleep, then snuck downstairs and let myself out the back door.</p><p>I sped through the dark like a comet. Nobody saw or heard me, I moved so fast. I had a cross in one pocket, which I'd found in Mom's jewelry box, and a bottle of holy water in the other, which one of Dad's pen pals had sent to us years ago. I wasn't able to find a stake. I'd thought about bringing a sharp knife instead, but probably would only have cut myself. I'm clumsy with knives.</p><p>The old theater was pitch black and deserted. I used the front door this time.</p><p>I didn't know what I'd do if the vampire wasn't there, but somehow I sensed he would be. It was like the day Steve threw the scraps of paper up in the air with the winning ticket hidden amongst them, and I shut my eyes and reached out blindly. It was destiny.</p><p>It took a while to find the cellar. I'd brought a flashlight but the battery was almost dead and it flickered out after a couple of minutes, leaving me to grope through the dark like a mole. When I did find the steps, I started straight down, not giving fear time to catch up.</p><p>The farther down I went, the brighter it got, until I reached the bottom and saw five tall flickering candles. I was surprised weren't vampires supposed to be afraid of fire? but glad.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley was waiting for me at the other end of the cellar. He was sitting at a small table, playing a game of cards with himself.</p><p>\"Good morning, Master Shan,\" he said, without looking up.</p><p>I cleared my throat before replying. \"It's not morning,\" I said. \"It's the middle of the night.\"</p><p>\"To me, that is morning,\" he said, then looked up and grinned. His teeth were long and sharp. This was the closest to him I'd been and I expected to spot all sorts of details red teeth, long ears, narrow eyes but he looked like a normal human, albeit a tremendously ugly one.</p><p>\"You've been waiting for me, haven't you?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Yes. \"He nodded.</p><p>\"How long have you known where Madam Octa was?\"</p><p>\"I found her the night you stole her,\" he said.</p><p>\"Why didn't you take her then?\"</p><p>He shrugged. \"I was going to, but I got to thinking about the sort of boy who would dare steal from a vampire, and I decided you might be worth further study.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" I asked, trying to stop my knees from knocking together.</p><p>\"Why indeed?\" he replied mockingly. He snapped his fingers and the cards on the table jumped together and slid back into the pack by themselves. He put it away and cracked his knuckles. \"Tell me, Darren Shan, why have you come? Is it to steal from me again? Do you still desire Madam Octa?\"</p><p>I shook my head. \"I never want to see that monster again!\" I snarled.</p><p>He laughed. \"She will be so sad to hear that.\"</p><p>\"Don't make fun of me,\" I warned him. \"I don't like being teased.\"</p><p>\"No?\" he asked. \"And what will you do if I continue?\"</p><p>I pulled out the cross and bottle of holy water and held them up. \"I'll strike you with these!\" I roared, expecting him to fall back, frozen with fear. But he didn't. Instead he smiled, snapped his fingers again, and suddenly the cross and plastic bottle were no longer in my hands. They were in his.</p><p>He studied the cross, chuckled and squeezed it into a little ball, as though it were made of tinfoil. Next he uncorked the holy water and drank it.</p><p>\"You know what I love?\" he asked. \"I love people who watch lots of horror movies and read horror books. Because they believe what they read and hear, and come packing silly things like crosses and holy water, instead of weapons that could do real damage, like guns and hand grenades.\"</p><p>\"You mean...crosses don't...hurt you?\" I stammered.</p><p>\"Why should they?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Because you're...evil,\" I said.</p><p>\"Am I?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said. \"You must be. You're a vampire. Vampires are evil.\"</p><p>\"You should not believe everything you are told,\" he said. \"It is true that our appetites are rather exotic. But just because we drink blood does not mean that we are evil. Are vampire bats evil when they drink the blood of cows and horses?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said. \"But that's different. They're animals.\"</p><p>\"Humans are animals, too,\" he told me. \"If a vampire kills a human, then yes, he is evil. But one who just takes a little blood to fill his rumbling belly...where is the harm in that?\"</p><p>I couldn't answer. I was numb and no longer knew what to believe. I was at his mercy, alone and defenseless.</p><p>\"I see you are not in the mood for a debate,\" he said. \"Very well. I will save the speeches for another time. So tell me, Darren Shan: what is it you want if not my spider?\"</p><p>\"She bit Steve Leonard,\" I told him.</p><p>\"The one known as Steve Leopard,\" he said, nodding. \"A nasty business. Still, little boys who play with things they do not understand can hardly complain if...\"</p><p>\"I want you to make him better!\" I yelled, interrupting.</p><p>\"Me?\" he asked, acting surprised. \"But I am not a doctor. I am not a specialist. I am just a circus performer. A freak. Remember?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said. \"You're more. I know you can save him. I know you have the power.\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\" he said. \"Madam Octa's bite is deadly, but for every poison there exists an antidote. Maybe I do have the cure. Maybe I have a bottle of serum that will restore your friend's natural physical functions.\"</p>","<p>\"Yes!\" I shouted gleefully. \"I knew it! I knew it! I...\"</p><p>\"But maybe,\" Mr. Crepsley said, raising a long bony finger to silence me, \"it is a small bottle. Maybe there is only a tiny amount of serum. Maybe it is very precious. Maybe I want to save it for a real emergency, in case Madam Octa ever bites me. Maybe I do not want to waste it on an evil little brat.\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said softly. \"You have to give it to me. You have to use it on Steve. He's dying. You can't let him die.\"</p><p>\"I most certainly can.\" Mr. Crepsley laughed. \"What is your friend to me? You heard him the night he was here: he said he would become a vampire hunter when he grew up!\"</p><p>\"He didn't mean it,\" I gasped. \"He only said that because he was angry.\"</p><p>\"Perhaps,\" Mr. Crepsley mused, tugging at his chin and stroking his scar. \"But again, I ask: why should I save Steve Leopard? The serum was expensive and cannot be replaced.\"</p><p>\"I can pay for it,\" I cried, and that was what he had been waiting for. I saw it in his eyes, the way they narrowed, the way he hunched forward, smiling. This was why he hadn't taken Madam Octa that first night. This was why he hadn't left town.</p><p>\"Pay for it?\" he asked slyly. \"But you are only a boy. You cannot possibly have enough money to buy the cure.\"</p><p>\"I'll pay in small amounts,\" I promised. \"Every week for fifty years, or as long as you want. I'll get a job when I grow up and give you all my money. I swear.\"</p><p>He shook his head. \"No,\" he said softly. \"Your money does not interest me.\"</p><p>\"What does interest you?\" I asked in a low voice. \"I'm sure you have a price. That's why you waited for me, isn't it?\"</p><p>\"You are a clever young man,\" he said. \"I knew that when I woke up to find my spider gone and your note in her place. I said to myself, 'Larten, there goes a most remarkable child, a true prodigy. There goes a boy who is going places.?</p><p>\"Quit with the bull and tell me what you want,\" I snarled.</p><p>He laughed nastily, then grew serious. \"You remember what Steve Leopard and I talked about?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Of course,\" I replied. \"He wanted to become a vampire. You said he was too young, so he said he'd become your assistant. That was all right by you, but then you found out he was evil, so you said no.\"</p><p>\"That about sums it up,\" he agreed. \"Except, if you recall, I was not too keen on the idea of an assistant. They can be useful but also a burden.\"</p><p>\"Where's all this leading?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I have had a rethink since then,\" he said. \"I decided it might not be such a bad thing after all, especially now that I have been separated from the Cirque Du Freak and will have to fend for myself. An assistant could be just what the witch doctor ordered.\" He smiled at his little joke.</p><p>I frowned. \"You mean you'll let Steve become your assistant now?\"</p><p>\"Heavens, no!\" he yelped. \"That monster? There is no telling what he will do as he matures. No, Darren Shan, I do not want Steve Leopard to be my assistant.\" He pointed at me with his long bony finger again, and I knew what he was going to say seconds before he said it.</p><p>\"You want me!\" I sighed, beating him to the punch, and his dark, sinister smile told me I was right.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>\"YOU'RE CRAZY!\" I YELLED, STUMBLING backward. \"There's no way I'd become your assistant! You must be mad to even think such a thing!\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley shrugged. \"Then Steve Leopard dies,\" he said simply.</p><p>I stopped retreating. \"Please,\" I begged, \"there must be another way.\"</p><p>\"The issue is not open to debate,\" he said. \"If you wish to save your friend, you must join me. If you refuse, we have nothing further to discuss.\"</p><p>\"What if I...\"</p><p>\"Do not waste my time!\" he snapped, pounding on the table. \"I have lived in this dirty hole for two weeks, putting up with fleas and cockroaches and lice. If you are not interested in my offer, say so and I will leave. But do not waste my time with other options, because there are none.\"</p><p>I nodded slowly and took a few-steps forward. \"Tell me more about being a vampire's assistant,\" I said.</p><p>He smiled. \"You will be my traveling companion,\" he explained. \"You will travel with me across the world. You will be my eyes and hands during the day. You will guard me while I sleep. You will find food for me if it is scarce. You will take my clothes to the laundry. You will polish my shoes. You will look after Madam Octa. In short, you will see to my every need. In return, I will teach you the ways of the vampires.\"</p><p>\"Do I have to become a vampire?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Eventually,\" he said. \"At first you will only have some vampire powers. I will make you a half-vampire. That means you will be able to move about during the day. You will not need much blood to keep you satisfied. You will have certain powers but not all. And you will only age at a fifth the regular rate, instead of the full vampire's tenth.\"</p><p>\"What does that mean?\" I asked, confused.</p><p>\"Vampires do not live forever,\" he explained, \"but we do live far longer than humans. We age at about one-tenth the regular rate. Which means, for every ten years that pass, we age one. As a half-vampire, you will age one year for every five.\"</p><p>\"You mean, for every five years that pass, I'll only be one year older?\" I asked.</p><p>\"That is right.\"</p><p>\"I dunno,\" I muttered. \"It sounds sketchy to me.\"</p><p>\"It is your choice,\" he said. \"I cannot force you to become my assistant. If you decide it is not to your liking, you are free to leave.\"</p><p>\"But Steve will die if I do that!\" I cried.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he agreed. \"It is your assistance or his life.\"</p><p>\"That's not much of a choice,\" I grumbled.</p><p>\"No,\" he admitted, \"it is not. But it is the only one I offer. Do you accept?\"</p><p>I thought it over. I wanted to say no, run away, and never return. But if I did, Steve would die. Was he worth such a deal? Did I feel guilty enough to offer my life for his? The answer was:</p><p>Yes.</p><p>\"Okay,\" I sighed. \"I don't like it, but my hands are tied. I just want you to know this: if I ever get the chance to betray you, I will. If the opportunity arises to pay you back, I'll take it. You'll never be able to trust me.\"</p>","<p>\"Fair enough,\" he said.</p><p>\"I mean it,\" I warned him.</p><p>\"I know you do,\" he said. \"That is why I want you. A vampire's assistant must have spirit. Your fighting quality is exactly what drew me to you. You will be a dangerous lad to have around, I am sure, but in a fight, when the chips are down, I am just as sure you will be a worthy ally.\"</p><p>I took a deep breath. \"How do we do it?\" I asked.</p><p>He stood and pushed the table aside. Stepped forward until he was about a foot away. He seemed tall as a building. There was a foul smell to him that I hadn't noticed before, the smell of blood.</p><p>He raised his right hand and showed me the back of it. His nails weren't especially long but they looked sharp. He raised his left hand and pressed the nails of the right into the fleshy tips of his left-hand fingers. Then he used his other set of nails to mark the right-hand fingers in the same way. He winced as he did it.</p><p>\"Lift your hands,\" he grunted. I was watching the blood drip from his fingers and didn't obey the command. \"Now!\" he yelled, grabbing my hands and jerking them up.</p><p>He dug his nails into the soft tips of my fingers, all ten of them at once. I cried out with pain and fell back, tucking my hands in at my sides, rubbing them against my jacket.</p><p>\"Do not be such a baby,\" he jeered, tugging my hands free.</p><p>\"It hurts! \"I howled.</p><p>\"Of course it does.\" He laughed. \"It hurt me too. Did you think becoming a vampire was easy? Get used to the pain. Much of it lies ahead.\"</p><p>He put a couple of my fingers in his mouth and sucked some blood out. I watched as he rolled it around his mouth, testing it. Finally he nodded and swallowed. \"It is good blood,\" he said. \"We can proceed.\"</p><p>He pressed his fingers against mine, wound to wound. For a few seconds there was a numb feeling at the ends of my arms. Then I felt a gushing sensation and realized my blood was moving from my body to his through my left hand, while his blood was entering mine through my right.</p><p>It was a strange, tingling feeling. I felt his blood travel up my right arm, then down the side of my body and over to the left. When it reached my heart there was a stabbing pain and I almost collapsed. The same thing was happening to Mr. Crepsley and I could see him grinding his teeth and sweating.</p><p>The pain lasted until Mr. Crepsley's blood crept down my left arm and started flowing back into his body. We remained joined for a couple more seconds, until he broke free with a shout. I fell backward to the floor. I was dizzy and felt sick.</p><p>\"Give me your fingers,\" Mr. Crepsley said. I looked across and saw him licking his. \"My spit will heal the wounds. You will lose all your blood and die otherwise.\"</p><p>I glanced down at my hands and saw blood leaking out. Stretching them forth, I let the vampire put them in his mouth and run his rough tongue over the tips.</p><p>When he released them, the flow had stopped. I wiped the leftover blood off on a rag. I studied my fingers and noted they now had ten tiny scars running across them.</p><p>\"That is how you recognize a vampire,\" Mr. Crepsley told me. \"There are other ways to change a human but the fingers are the simplest and least painful method.\"</p><p>\"Is that it?\" I asked. \"Am I a half-vampire now?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" he said.</p><p>\"I don't feel any different,\" I told him.</p><p>\"It will take a few days for the effects to become apparent,\" he said. \"There is always a period of adjustment. The shock would be too great otherwise.\"</p><p>\"How do you become a full vampire?\" I asked.</p><p>\"The same way,\" he said, \"only you stay joined longer, so more of the vampire's blood enters your body.\"</p><p>\"What will I be able to do with my new powers?\" I asked. \"Will I be able to change into a bat?\"</p><p>His laughter rocked the room. \"A bat!\" he shrieked. \"You do not believe those silly stories, do you? How on Earth could somebody the size of you or I turn into a tiny flying rat? Use your brain, boy. We can no more turn into bats, rats, or fog than we can turn into ships, planes, or monkeys!\"</p><p>\"So what can we do?\" I asked.</p><p>He scratched his chin. \"There is too much to explain right now,\" he said. \"We must tend to your friend. If he does not get the antidote before tomorrow morning, the serum will not work. Besides, we have plenty of time to discuss secret powers.\" He grinned. \"You could say we have all the time in the world.\"</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-SIX</p><p>MR. CREPSLEY LED THE WAY up the stairs and out of the building. He walked confidently through the darkness. I thought I could see a bit better than I could when coming in, but that might just have been because my eyes were used to the dark, not because of the vampire blood in my veins.</p><p>Once outside, he told me to hop up on his back. \"Keep your arms wrapped around my neck,\" he said. \"Do not let go or make any sudden movements.\"</p><p>As I was getting up, I looked down and saw he was wearing slippers. I thought it was strange but didn't say anything.</p><p>When I was on his back, he started running. I didn't notice anything strange at first, but soon began to realize how fast buildings were zipping by. Mr. Crepsley's legs didn't seem to be moving that quickly.</p><p>Instead, it was as if the world was moving faster and we were slipping past it!</p><p>We reached the hospital in a couple of minutes. Normally it would have taken twenty minutes, and that was if you sprinted all the way.</p><p>\"How did you do that?\" I asked, sliding down.</p><p>\"Speed is relative,\" he said, tugging his red cloak tight around his shoulders, pulling back into the shadows so we could not be seen, and that was all the answer he gave.</p><p>\"Which room is your friend in?\" he asked.</p><p>I told him Steve's room number. He looked up, counting windows, then nodded and told me to hop back up on his back. When I was in position, he walked over to the wall, took off his slippers, and laid his fingers and toes against the wall. Then he shoved his nails forward into the brick!</p><p>\"Hmmm,\" he muttered. \"It is crumbly but it will hold us. Do not panic if we slip. I know how to land on my feet. It takes a very long fall to kill a vampire.\"</p><p>He climbed up the wall, digging his nails in, moving a hand forward, then a foot, then the other hand and foot, one after the other. He moved quickly and within moments we were at Steve's window, crouching on the ledge, gazing in.</p><p>I wasn't sure of the time, but it was very late. No-body was in the room except for Steve. Mr. Crepsley tried the window. It was locked. He laid the fingers of one hand beside the glass covering the latch, then clicked the fingers of his other hand.</p>","<p>The latch sprang open! He shoved the window up and stepped inside. I got down from his back. While he checked the door, I examined Steve. His breathing was more ragged than it had been and there were new tubes all over his body, hooked up to menacing-looking machines.</p><p>\"The poison has worked rapidly,\" Mr. Crepsley said, gazing down at him over my shoulder. \"We might be too late to save him.\" I felt my insides turn to ice at his words.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley bent over and rolled up one of Steve's eyelids. For a few long seconds he stared at the eyeball and held Steve's right wrist. Finally he grunted.</p><p>\"We are in time,\" he said, and I felt my heart lifting. \"But it is a good thing you did not wait any longer. A few more hours and he would have been a goner.\"</p><p>\"Just get on with it and cure him,\" I snapped, not wanting to know how close to death my best friend had come.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley reached into one of his many pockets and produced a small glass vial. He turned on the bedside lamp and held the bottle up to the light to examine the serum. \"I must be careful,\" he told me. \"This antidote is almost as lethal as the poison. A couple of drops too many and...\" He didn't need to finish.</p><p>He tilted Steve's head to one side and told me to hold it that way. He leaned one of his nails against the flesh of Steve's neck and made a small cut. Blood oozed out. He stuck his finger over it, then removed the cork of the bottle with his other hand.</p><p>He lifted the vial to his mouth and prepared to drink. \"What are you doing?\" I asked.</p><p>\"It must be passed on by mouth,\" he said. \"A doctor could inject it but I do not know about needles and the like.\"</p><p>\"Is that safe?\" I asked. \"Won't you pass on germs?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley grinned. \"If you want to call a doctor, feel free,\" he said. \"Otherwise, have some faith in a man who was doing this long before your grandfather was born.\"</p><p>He poured the serum into his mouth, then rolled it from side to side. He leaned forward and covered the cut with his lips. His cheeks bulged out, then in, as he blew the serum into Steve.</p><p>He sat back when he was finished and wiped around his mouth. He spat the last of the fluid onto the floor. \"I am always afraid of swallowing that stuff by accident,\" he said. \"One of these nights, I am going to take a course and learn how to do this the easy way.\"</p><p>I was about to reply, but then Steve moved. His neck flexed, then his head, then his shoulders. His arms twitched and his legs started to jerk. His face creased up and he began to moan.</p><p>\"What's happening?\" I asked, afraid that something had gone wrong.</p><p>\"It is all right,\" Mr. Crepsley said, putting away the bottle. \"He was on the brink of death. The journey back is never a pleasant one. He will be in pain for some time, but he will live.\"</p><p>\"Will there be any side effects?\" I asked. \"He won't be paralyzed from the waist down or anything?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"He will be fine. He will feel a bit stiff and will catch colds very easily, but otherwise he will be the same as he was before.\"</p><p>Steve's eyes shot open suddenly and focused on me and Mr. Crepsley. A puzzled look swept across his face and he tried speaking. But his mouth wouldn't work, and then his eyes went blank and closed again.</p><p>\"Steve?\" I called, shaking him. \"Steve?\"</p><p>\"That is going to happen a lot,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"He will be slipping in and out of consciousness all night. By morning he should be awake and by afternoon he will be sitting up and asking for dinner.</p><p>\"Come,\" he said. \"Let us go.\"</p><p>\"I want to stick around a while longer, to make sure he recovers,\" I replied.</p><p>\"You mean you want to make sure I have not tricked you.\" Mr. Crepsley laughed. \"We will come back tomorrow and you will see that he is fine. We really must go now. If we stay any...\"</p><p>All of a sudden, the door opened and a nurse walked in!</p><p>\"What's going on here?\" she shouted, stunned to see us. \"Who the hell are...\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley reacted quickly, grabbing Steve's bedcovers and throwing them over the nurse. She fell down as she tried to remove the sheets, getting her hands stuck in their folds.</p><p>\"Come,\" Mr. Crepsley hissed, rushing to the window. \"We have to leave immediately.\"</p><p>I stared at the hand he was holding out, then at Steve, then at the nurse, then at the open door.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley lowered his hand. \"I see,\" he said in a bleak voice. \"You are going to go back on our deal.\" I hesitated, opened my mouth to say something, then acting without thinking turned and made a dash for the door!</p><p>I thought he would stop me, but he did nothing, only howled after me as I ran: \"Very well. Run, Darren Shan! It will do you no good. You are a creature of the night now. You are one of us! You will be back. You will come crawling on your knees, begging for help. Run, fool, run!\"</p><p>And he began to laugh.</p><p>His laughter followed me through the corridor, down the stairs, and out the front door. I kept glancing over my shoulder as I ran, expecting him to swoop down on me, but there was no sign of him on the way home, not a glimpse or a smell or a sound.</p><p>All that remained of him was his laughter, which echoed through my brain like a witch's cackling curse.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>I ACTED SURPRISED WHEN MOM GOT off the phone that Monday morning and told me Steve had recovered. She was excited and did a little dance with me and Annie in the kitchen.</p><p>\"He snapped out of it by himself?\" Dad asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" she said. \"The doctors can't understand it, but nobody's complaining!\"</p><p>\"Incredible,\" Dad muttered.</p><p>\"Maybe it's a miracle,\" Annie said, and I had to turn my head aside to hide my smile. Some miracle!</p><p>While Mom went off to see Mrs. Leonard, I started out for school. I was half-afraid the sunlight would burn me when I left the house, but of course it didn't. Mr. Crepsley had told me I would be able to move around during the day.</p><p>I wondered, from time to time, if it had been a bad dream. It seemed crazy, looking back. Deep down I knew it was real, but I tried believing otherwise, and sometimes almost did.</p><p>The part I hated most was the thought of being stuck in this body for so long. How would I explain it to Mom and Dad and everybody else? I'd look silly after a couple of years, especially at school, stuck in a class with people who looked older than me.</p>","<p>I went to visit Steve on Tuesday. He was sitting up, watching TV, eating a box of chocolates. He was delighted to see me and told me about his stay in the hospital, the food, the games nurses brought him to play with, the presents that were piling up.</p><p>\"I'll have to get bitten by poisonous spiders more often,\" he joked.</p><p>\"I wouldn't make a habit of it if I were you,\" I told him. \"You might not get well next time.\"</p><p>He studied me thoughtfully. \"You know, the doctors are baffled,\" he said. \"They don't know what made me sick and they don't know how I recovered.\"</p><p>\"You didn't tell them about Madam Octa?\" I asked.</p><p>\"No,\" he said. \"There didn't seem much point. It would have meant trouble for you.\"</p><p>\"Thanks.\"</p><p>\"What happened to her?\" he asked. \"What did you do with her after she bit me?\"</p><p>\"I killed her,\" I lied. \"I got mad and stomped her to death.\"</p><p>\"Really? \"he asked.</p><p>\"Really.\"</p><p>He nodded slowly, never taking his eyes off me. \"When I first woke up,\" he said, I thought I saw you. I must have been mistaken, because it was the middle of the night. But it was a lifelike dream. I even thought I saw someone with you, tall and ugly, dressed in red, with orange hair and a long scar down the left side of his face.\"</p><p>I didn't say anything. I couldn't. I looked down at the floor and squeezed my hands together.</p><p>\"Another funny thing,\" he said. \"The nurse who discovered me awake swore there were two people in the room, a man and a boy. The doctors think it was her mind playing tricks and said it doesn't matter. Strange, though, isn't it?\"</p><p>\"Very strange,\" I agreed, unable to look him in the eye.</p><p>I began noticing changes in myself over the next couple of days. I found it hard getting to sleep when I went to bed, and kept waking in the middle of the night. My hearing improved and I was able to hear people talking from far away. In school, I could listen to voices from the next two rooms, almost as if there were no walls between my class and theirs.</p><p>I began to get in better shape. I was able to run around the yard during break and lunch without working up a sweat. Nobody could keep up with me. I was also more aware of my body and was able to control it. I could make a soccer ball do pretty much what I wanted, dribbling around opponents at will. I scored sixteen goals on Thursday.</p><p>I grew stronger, too. I was able to do push-ups and pull-ups now, as many as I liked. I didn't have new muscles none that I could see but there was a strength flowing through me that hadn't been there before. I had yet to test it properly but I believed it might be immense.</p><p>I tried hiding my new talents but it was difficult. I explained away the running and soccer skills by saying I was exercising and practicing a lot more, but other things were trickier.</p><p>Like when the bell rang on Thursday at the end of lunch. The ball had just been kicked into the air by the goalie who I'd put sixteen goals past. It was coming toward me, so I stuck up my right hand to catch it. I did, but as I squeezed, my nails sunk in and burst it!</p><p>And when I was eating dinner at home that night, I wasn't concentrating. I could hear our next-door neighbors having a fight and I was listening to their argument. I was eating french fries and hot dogs, and after a while I noticed the food was tougher than it should have been. I glanced down and realized I'd bitten the head off the fork and was chewing it to pieces! Luckily, no one saw, and I was able to slip it into the wastebasket as I was washing up.</p><p>Steve called that night. He'd been let out of the hospital. He was supposed to take things easy for a few days and not come to school until after the weekend, but he said he was going crazy with boredom and had persuaded his mother to let him come tomorrow.</p><p>\"You mean you want to come to school?\" I asked, shocked.</p><p>\"Sounds weird, doesn't it?\" He laughed. \"Normally I'm looking for an excuse to stay home. Yet now, when I have one, I want to go! But you don't know how dull it is being stuck indoors alone all the time. It was fun for a couple of days, but a whole week of it...brrr!\"</p><p>I thought of telling Steve the truth but wasn't sure how he'd take it. He had wanted to become a vampire. I didn't think he'd like knowing Mr. Crepsley had picked me instead of him.</p><p>And telling Annie was out of the question. She hadn't mentioned Madam Octa since Steve recovered but I often found her watching me. I don't know what was going through her head, but my guess is it was something like: \"Steve got better, but it wasn't because of you. You had the chance to save him and you didn't. You told a lie and risked his life, just so you wouldn't get into trouble. Would you have done the same if it had been me?\"</p><p>Steve was the center of attention that Friday. The whole class crowded around and begged for his story. They wanted to know what had poisoned him, how he'd survived, what the hospital had been like, if they'd operated on him, if he had any scars, and so on.</p><p>\"I don't know what bit me,\" he said. \"I was at Darren's house. I was sitting by the window. I heard a noise but before I could look to see what it was, I got bitten and passed out.\" This was the story we had agreed upon when I went to visit him at the hospital.</p><p>I felt stranger than ever that Friday. I spent the morning gazing around the classroom, feeling out of place. It seemed so pointless. \"I shouldn't be here,\" I kept thinking. \"I'm not a normal kid anymore. I should be out earning my living as a vampire's assistant. What good will English, history, and geography do me now? This isn't my scene.\"</p><p>Tommy and Alan told Steve about my skill on the soccer field. \"He's running like the wind these days,\" Alan said.</p><p>\"And playing like Pele,\" Tommy added.</p><p>\"Really?\" Steve asked, looking at me oddly. \"What's brought on the big change, Darren?\"</p><p>\"There isn't any change,\" I lied. \"I'm just on a roll. I'm lucky.\"</p><p>\"Listen to Mr. Modest!\" Tommy laughed. \"Mr. Dalton has said he might put him at forward for the under-seventeen soccer team. Imagine one of us playing for the under-seventeens! Nobody our age has ever made that team.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Steve mused. \"They haven't.\"</p><p>\"Aw, it's just Dalton talking,\" I said, trying to brush it aside.</p><p>\"Maybe,\" Steve said. \"Maybe?</p>","<p>I played badly that lunchtime, on purpose. I could tell Steve was suspicious. I don't think he knew what was going on, but he sensed something was different about me. I ran slowly and missed chances I normally would have put away even without the special powers.</p><p>My ploy worked. By the end of the game he'd stopped studying my every move and was beginning to joke with me again. But then something happened that ruined everything.</p><p>Alan and me were running for the same ball. He shouldn't have been going for it, because I was closest. But Alan was a little younger than the rest of us and sometimes acted stupidly. I thought about pulling back but I was sick of playing badly. Lunch was almost over and I wanted to score at least one goal. So I decided, \"The hell with Alan Morris. That's my ball and if he gets in my way, tough!\"</p><p>We clashed with each other just before reaching the ball. Alan gave a yell and went flying. I laughed, trapped the ball under my foot, and turned toward goal.</p><p>The sight of blood stopped me in my tracks.</p><p>Alan had landed awkwardly and cut his left knee. It was a bad gash and blood was welling up. He had started to cry and was making no move to cover it with a tissue or scrap of cloth.</p><p>Somebody kicked the ball away from beneath my foot and ran off with it. I took no notice. My eyes were focused on Alan. More specifically, on Alan's knee. More specifically still, on Alan's blood.</p><p>I took a step toward him. Then another. I was standing over him now, blocking the light. He gazed up and must have seen something odd in my face, because he stopped crying and stared at me uneasily.</p><p>I dropped to my knees and, before I knew what I was doing, I had covered the cut on his leg with my mouth and was sucking out his blood and gulping it down!</p><p>This went on for a few seconds. My eyes were closed and the blood filled my mouth. It tasted amazing. I'm not sure how much I would have drank or how much harm I would have done to Alan. Luckily, I didn't get the chance to find out.</p><p>I became aware of people around me and opened my eyes. Nearly everyone had stopped playing and was staring at me in horror. I removed my lips from Alan's knee and looked around at my friends, wondering how to explain this.</p><p>Then the solution hit me and I jumped up and spread my arms. \"I am the vampire lord!\" I yelled. \"I am the king of the undead! I will suck the blood from all of you!\"</p><p>They stared at me in shock, then laughed. They thought it was a joke! They thought I was only pretending to be a vampire.</p><p>\"You're a nut, Shan,\" somebody said.</p><p>\"That's gross!\" a girl squealed as fresh blood dripped down my chin. \"You should be locked away!\"</p><p>The bell rang and it was time to return to class. I was feeling pleased with myself. I thought I'd fooled everybody. But then I noticed someone near the back of the crowd and my joy faded. It was Steve, and his dark face told me he knew exactly what had happened. He hadn't been fooled at all. He knew.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>I AVOIDED STEVE THAT EVENING AND rushed straight home. I was confused. Why had I attacked Alan? I didn't want to drink anybody's blood. I hadn't been looking for a victim. So how come I'd jumped on him like a wild animal? And what if it happened again? And what if next time there was nobody around to stop me and I went on sucking until...</p><p>No, that was a crazy thought. The sight of blood had taken me by surprise, that was all. I hadn't been expecting it. I would learn from this experience and next time I'd be able to hold myself back.</p><p>The taste of blood was still in my mouth, so I went to the bathroom and washed it out with several glasses of water, then brushed my teeth.</p><p>I studied myself in the mirror. My face looked the same as ever. My teeth weren't any longer or sharper.</p><p>My eyes and ears were the same. I had the same old body. No extra muscles, no added height, no fresh patches of hair. The only visible difference was in my nails, which had hardened and darkened.</p><p>So why was I acting so strangely?</p><p>I drew one of my nails along the glass of the mirror and it made a long deep scratch. \"I'll have to be careful of those,\" I thought to myself.</p><p>My attack on Alan aside, I didn't appear to be too badly off. In fact, the more I thought about it, the less dreadful it seemed. Okay, it would take a long time to grow up, and I'd have to be careful if I saw fresh blood. Those were downers.</p><p>But apart from that, life should be fine. I was stronger than anybody else my age, faster and fitter. I could become a sprinter or a boxer or a soccer player. My age would work against me but if I was talented enough, that wouldn't matter.</p><p>Imagine: a vampire soccer player! I'd make millions. I'd be on TV talk shows, people would write books about me, a film would be made of my life, and I might be asked to make a song with a famous band. Maybe I could get work in the movie business as a stuntman for other kids. Or...</p><p>My thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door. \"Who is it? \"I asked.</p><p>\"Annie,\" came the reply. \"Are you finished yet? I've been waiting forever to use the bathroom.\"</p><p>\"Come in,\" I told her. \"I'm done.\"</p><p>She entered. \"Admiring yourself in the mirror again?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Of course.\" I grinned. \"Why shouldn't I?\"</p><p>\"If I had a face like yours, I'd stay away from mirrors.\" She giggled. She had a towel wrapped around her. She turned on the bath faucets and ran a hand under the water to make sure it wasn't too hot. Then she sat on the edge of the tub and studied me.</p><p>\"You look strange,\" she said.</p><p>\"I don't,\" I said. Then, looking in the mirror, I asked: \"Do I?\"</p><p>\"Yeah,\" she said. \"I don't know what it is, but there's something different about you.\"</p><p>\"You're just imagining things,\" I told her. \"I'm the same as I always was.\"</p><p>\"No,\" she said, shaking her head. \"You're definitely...\" The tub began filling up, so she stopped speaking and turned aside to turn off the faucets. As she was bending over, my eyes focused on the curve of her neck, and suddenly my mouth went dry.</p><p>\"As I was saying, you look...\" she began, turning back around.</p><p>She stopped when she saw my eyes.</p><p>\"Darren?\" she asked nervously. \"Darren, what are...\"</p><p>I raised my right hand and she went quiet. Her eyes widened and she stared silently at my fingers as I waved them slowly from side to side, then around in small circles. I wasn't sure how I was doing it, but I was hypnotizing her!</p>","<p>\"Come here,\" I growled, my voice deeper than normal. Annie rose and obeyed. She moved as if sleepwalking, eyes blank, arms and legs stiff.</p><p>When she stopped before me, I traced the outline of her neck with my fingers. I was breathing heavily and seeing her as though through a misty cloud. My tongue slowly licked around my lips and my belly rumbled. The bathroom felt as hot as a furnace, and I could see beads of sweat rolling down Annie's face.</p><p>I walked around the back of her, my hands never leaving her flesh. I could feel the veins throbbing as I stroked them, and when I pressed down on one near the bottom of her neck, I could see it standing out, blue and beautiful, begging to be ripped open and sucked dry.</p><p>I bared my teeth and leaned forward, jaws wide open.</p><p>At the last moment, as my lips touched her neck, I caught sight of my reflection in the mirror, and thankfully that was enough to make me pause.</p><p>The face in the mirror was a twisted, unfamiliar mask, full of red eyes, sharp wrinkles, and a vicious grin. I lifted my head for a closer look. It was me but at the same time it wasn't. It was like there were two people sharing one body, a normal human boy and a savage animal of the night.</p><p>As I stared, the ugly face faded and the urge to drink blood passed. I gazed at Annie, horrified. I'd been about to bite her! I would have fed on my own sister!</p><p>I fell away from her with a cry and covered my face with my hands, afraid of the mirror and what I might see. Annie staggered backward, then looked around the bathroom in a dazed kind of way.</p><p>\"What's going on?\" she asked. \"I feel weird. I came in for a bath, didn't I? Is it ready?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said softly. \"It's ready.\"</p><p>I was ready, too. Ready to become a vampire!</p><p>\"I'll leave you alone,\" I said, and let myself out.</p><p>I fell against the wall in the hall, where I spent a couple of minutes taking deep breaths and trying to calm down.</p><p>It couldn't be controlled. The thirst for blood was something I wouldn't be able to beat. I didn't even have to see spilled blood now. Just thinking of it had been enough to bring out the monster in me.</p><p>I stumbled to my room and collapsed upon my bed. I cried as I lay there, because I knew my life as a human had come to an end. I could no longer live as plain old Darren Shan. The vampire in me could not be controlled. Sooner or later it would make me do something terrible and I would end up killing Mom or Dad or Annie.</p><p>I couldn't let that happen. I wouldn't. My life was no longer important, but those of my friends and family were. For their sakes, I would have to travel far away, to a place where I could do no harm.</p><p>I waited for dark to fall, then let myself out. No hanging around this time until my parents fell asleep. I didn't dare, because I knew one of them would come to my room before going to bed. I could picture it, Mom bending over to kiss me goodnight, getting the shock of her life as I bit into her neck.</p><p>I didn't leave a note or take anything with me. I wasn't able to think about such things. All I knew was, I had to get out, the sooner the better. Anything that delayed my exit was bad.</p><p>I walked quickly and was soon at the theater. It no longer looked scary. I was used to it. Besides, vampires have nothing to fear from dark, haunted buildings.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley was waiting for me inside the front door.</p><p>\"I heard you coming,\" he said. \"You lasted longer in the world of humans than I thought.\"</p><p>\"I sucked blood from one of my best friends,\" I told him. \"And I almost bit my younger sister.\"</p><p>\"You escaped lightly,\" he said. \"Many vampires kill someone close to them before realizing they are doomed.\"</p><p>\"There's no way back, is there?\" I asked sadly. \"No magic potion to make me human again or keep me from attacking people?\"</p><p>\"The only thing that can stop you now,\" he said, \"is the good old stake through the heart.\"</p><p>\"Very well,\" I sighed. \"I don't like it, but I guess I've got no other choice. I'm yours. I won't run away again. Do with me as you wish.\"</p><p>He nodded slowly. \"You probably will not believe this,\" he said, \"but I know what you are going through and I feel sorry for you.\" He shook his head. \"But that is neither here nor there. We have work to do and cannot afford to waste time. Come, Darren Shan,\" he said, taking my hand. \"We have much to do before you can assume your rightful place as my assistant.\"</p><p>\"Like what?\" I asked, confused.</p><p>\"First of all,\" he said, with a sly smile, \"we have to kill you!\"</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-NINE</p><p>I SPENT MY LAST WEEKEND SAYING silent good-byes. I visited every one of my favorite spots: library, swimming pool, cinema, parks, soccer field. I went to some of the places with Mom or Dad, some with Alan Morris or Tommy Jones. I would have liked to spend time with Steve but couldn't bear to face him.</p><p>I got the feeling, every so often, that I was being followed, and the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. But whenever I turned to look, nobody was there, Eventually I put it down to nerves and ignored it.</p><p>I treated every minute with my family and friends as if it was special. I paid close attention to their faces and voices, so I would never forget. I knew I'd never see these people again and that tore me apart inside, but it was the way it had to be. There was no going back.</p><p>They could do nothing wrong that weekend. Mom's kisses didn't embarrass me, Dad's orders didn't bother me, Alan's stupid jokes didn't annoy me.</p><p>I spent more time with Annie than with anybody else. I was going to miss her the most. I gave her piggyback rides and swung her around by the arms and took her to the soccer field with me and Tommy. I even played with her dolls!</p><p>Sometimes I felt like crying. I'd look at Mom or Dad or Annie and realize how much I loved them, how empty my life would be without them. I had to turn aside at moments like that and take long, deep breaths. A couple of times that didn't work and I rushed away to cry in private.</p><p>I think they guessed something was wrong. Mom came into my room that Saturday night and stayed for a long time, tucking me into bed, telling me stories, listening to me talk. It had been years since we'd spent time together like that. I felt sorry, after she'd gone, that we hadn't had more nights like this.</p><p>In the morning, Dad asked if there was anything I wanted to discuss with him. He said I was a growing young man and would be going through lots of changes, and he'd understand if I had mood swings or wanted to go off by myself. But he would always be there for me to talk to.</p>","<p>\"You'll be there, but I won't be!\" I felt like crying, but I kept quiet, nodded my head, and thanked him.</p><p>I behaved as perfectly as possible. I wanted to leave a fine final impression, so they would remember me as a good son, a good brother, a good friend. I didn't want anybody thinking badly of me when I was gone.</p><p>Dad was going to take us out to a restaurant for dinner that Sunday, but I asked if we could stay home to eat. This would be my last meal with them and I wanted it to be special. When I was looking back on it in later years, I wanted to be able to remember us together, at home, a happy family.</p><p>Mom cooked my favorite food: chicken, roast potatoes, corn on the cob. Annie and me had freshly squeezed orange juice to drink. Mom and Dad shared a bottle of wine. We had strawberry cheesecake for dessert. Everybody was in a good mood. We sang songs. Dad cracked terrible jokes. Mom played a tune with a pair of spoons. Annie recited a few poems. Everybody joined in for a game of charades.</p><p>It was a day I wished would never end. But, of course, all days must, and finally, as it always does, the sun dropped and the darkness of night crept across the sky.</p><p>Dad looked up after a while, then at his watch. \"Time for bed,\" he said. \"You two have school in the morning.\"</p><p>\"No,\" I thought, \"I don't. I don't have school ever again.\" That should have cheered me up but all I could think was: \"No school means no Mr. Dalton, no friends, no soccer, no school trips.\"</p><p>I delayed going to bed as long as I could. I spent forever taking off my clothes and putting on my pajamas; longer still washing my hands and face and brushing my teeth. Then, when it could be avoided no longer, I went downstairs to the living room, where Mom and Dad were talking. They looked up, surprised to see me.</p><p>\"Are you all right, Darren?\" Mom asked.</p><p>\"I'm fine,\" I said.</p><p>\"You're not feeling sick?\"</p><p>\"I'm fine,\" I assured her. \"I just wanted to say good night.\" I put my arms around Dad, then kissed him on the cheek. Next I did the same with Mom. \"Good night,\" I said to each.</p><p>\"This is one for the books.\" Dad laughed, rubbing his cheek where I had kissed him. \"How long since he kissed the two of us good night, Angie?\"</p><p>\"Too long.\" Mom smiled, patting my head.</p><p>\"I love you,\" I told them. \"I know I haven't said it very often, but I do. I love the both of you and always will.\"</p><p>\"We love you, too,\" Mom said. \"Don't we, Dermot?\"</p><p>\"Of course we do,\" Dad said.</p><p>\"Well, tell him,\" she insisted.</p><p>Dad sighed. \"I love you, Darren,\" he said, rolling his eyes in a way he knew would make me laugh. Then he gave me a hug. \"Really I do,\" he said, serious this time.</p><p>I left them then. I stood outside the door a while, listening to them talk, reluctant to depart.</p><p>\"What do you think brought that on?\" Mom asked.</p><p>\"Kids,\" Dad snorted. \"Who knows how their minds work?\"</p><p>\"There's something up,\" Mom said. \"He's been acting oddly for some time now.\"</p><p>\"Maybe he's got a girlfriend,\" Dad suggested.</p><p>\"Maybe,\" Mom said, but didn't sound convinced.</p><p>I'd lingered long enough. I was afraid that if I waited any longer, I might rush into the room and tell them what was really the matter. If I did, they'd stop me from going ahead with Mr. Crepsley's plan. They'd say that vampires weren't real and fight to keep me with them, in spite of the danger.</p><p>I thought of Annie and how close I'd come to biting her, and knew I must not let them stop me.</p><p>I trudged upstairs to my room. It was a warm night and the window was open. That was important.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley was waiting in the closet. He emerged when he heard me closing the door. \"It is stuffy in there,\" he complained. \"I feel sorry for Madam Octa, having had to spend so much time in...\"</p><p>\"Shut up,\" I told him.</p><p>\"No need to be rude,\" he sniffed. \"I was merely making a comment.\"</p><p>\"Well, don't,\" I said. \"You might not think much of this place but I do. This has been my home, my room, my closet, ever since I can remember. And I'm never going to see it again after tonight. This is my last little while here. So don't bad-mouth it, all right?\"</p><p>\"I am sorry,\" he said.</p><p>I took one long last look around the room, then sighed unhappily. I pulled a bag out from underneath the bed and handed it to Mr. Crepsley. \"What is this?\" he asked suspiciously.</p><p>\"Some personal stuff,\" I told him. \"My diary. A picture of my family. A couple of other things. Nothing that will be missed. Will you watch it for me?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" he said.</p><p>\"But only if you promise not to look through it,\" I said.</p><p>\"Vampires have no secrets from each other,\" he said. But, when he saw my face, he shrugged. \"I will not open it,\" he promised.</p><p>\"All right,\" I said, taking a deep breath. \"Do you have the potion?\" He nodded and handed over a small dark bottle. I looked inside. The liquid was dark and thick and foul-smelling.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley moved behind me and laid his hands on my neck.</p><p>\"You're sure this will work?\" I asked nervously.</p><p>\"Trust me,\" he said.</p><p>\"I always thought a broken neck meant people couldn't walk or move,\" I said.</p><p>\"No,\" he replied. \"The bones of the neck do not matter. Paralysis only happens if the spinal cord a long nerve running down the middle of the neck breaks. I will be careful not to damage it.\"</p><p>\"Won't the doctors think it's strange?\" I asked.</p><p>\"They will not check,\" he said. \"The potion will slow your heart down so much, they will be sure you are dead. They will find the broken neck and put two and two together. If you were older, they might go ahead with an autopsy. But no doctor likes cutting a child open.</p><p>\"Now, are you totally clear on what is going to happen and how you must act?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said.</p><p>\"There must be no mistakes,\" he warned. \"If you make just one slip our plans will fall apart.\"</p><p>\"I'm not a fool! I know what to do!\" I snapped.</p><p>\"Then do it,\" he said.</p><p>So I did.</p><p>With one angry gesture, I swallowed the contents of the bottle. I grimaced at the taste, then shuddered as my body started to stiffen. There wasn't much pain but an icy feeling spread through my bones and veins. My teeth began to chatter.</p>","<p>It took about ten minutes for the poison to work its deadly charms. At the end of that time I couldn't move any of my limbs, my lungs weren't working (well, they were, but very, very slowly), and my heart had stopped (again, not fully, but enough for its beat to be undetectable).</p><p>\"I am going to snap the neck now,\" Mr. Crepsley said, and I heard a quick clicking sound as he jerked my head to one side. I couldn't feel anything: my senses were dead. \"There,\" he said. \"That should do it. Now I am going to throw you out of the window.\"</p><p>He carried me over and stood there a moment with me, breathing in the night air.</p><p>\"I have to throw you hard enough to make it look genuine,\" he said. \"You might break some bones in the fall. They will start hurting when the potion wears off after a few days but I will fix them up later on.</p><p>\"Here we go!\"</p><p>He picked me up, paused a moment, then hurled me out and down.</p><p>I fell quickly, the house whizzing past in a blur, and landed heavily on my back. My eyes were open and I found myself staring at a drain at the foot of the house.</p><p>For a while my body went undetected, so I lay there, listening to the sounds of the night. In the end, a passing neighbor spotted me and investigated. I couldn't see his face but I heard his gasp when he turned me over and saw my lifeless body.</p><p>He rushed straight around to the front of the house and pounded on the door. I could hear his voice as he shouted for my mother and father. Then their voices as he led them around back. They thought he was pulling their leg or had been mistaken. My father was marching angrily and muttering to himself.</p><p>The footsteps stopped when they rounded the bend and saw me. For a long, terrible moment there was complete silence. Then Dad and Mom rushed forward and picked me up.</p><p>\"Darren!\" Mom screamed, clutching me to her chest.</p><p>\"Let go, Angie,\" Dad shouted, prying me free and laying me down on the grass.</p><p>\"What's wrong with him, Dermot?\" Mom wailed.</p><p>\"I don't know. He must have fallen.\" Dad stood and gazed up at my open bedroom window. I could see his hands flexing into fists.</p><p>\"He's not moving,\" Mom said calmly, then grabbed me and shook me fiercely. \"He's not moving!\" she screamed. \"He's not moving. He's...\"</p><p>Dad once again eased her hands away. He beckoned our neighbor over and handed Mom to him. \"Take her inside,\" he said softly. \"Call for an ambulance. I'll stay here and look after Darren.\"</p><p>\"Is he...dead?\" our neighbor asked. Mom moaned loudly when he said it and buried her face in her hands.</p><p>Dad shook his head softly. \"No,\" he said, giving Mom's shoulder a light squeeze. \"He's just paralyzed, like his friend was.\"</p><p>Mom lowered her hands. \"Like Steve?\" she asked half-hopefully.</p><p>\"Yes.\" Dad smiled. \"And he'll snap out of it like Steve. Now go call for help, okay?\"</p><p>Mom nodded, then hurried away with our neighbor. Dad held his smile until she was out of sight, then bent over me, checked my eyes, and felt my wrist for a pulse. When he found no sign of life, he laid me back down, brushed a lock of hair out of my eyes, then did something I'd never expected to see.</p><p>He started to cry.</p><p>And that was how I came to enter a new, miserable phase of my life, namely death.</p><p>Chapter THIRTY</p><p>IT DIDN'T TAKE THE DOCTORS long to pronounce their verdict. They couldn't find any breath or pulse or movement. It was an open-and-shut case as far as they were concerned.</p><p>The worst thing was knowing what was going on around me. I wished that I'd asked Mr. Crepsley to give me another potion, which could have put me to sleep. It was terrible, hearing Mom and Dad crying, Annie screaming for me to come back.</p><p>Friends of the family began arriving after a couple of hours, the cue for more sobbing and moans.</p><p>I'd have loved to avoid this. I would have rather run away with Mr. Crepsley in the middle of the night, but he'd told me that wasn't possible.</p><p>\"If you run away,\" he'd said, \"they would follow. There would be posters up everywhere, pictures in the papers and with the police. We would know no peace.\"</p><p>Faking my death was the only way. If they thought I was dead, I'd be free. Nobody comes searching for a dead person.</p><p>Now, as I heard the sadness, I cursed both Mr. Crepsley and myself. I shouldn't have done it. I shouldn't have put them through this.</p><p>Still, looking on the bright side, at least this would be the end of it. They were sad, and would be for some time, but they would get over it eventually (I hoped). If I'd run away, the misery could have lasted forever: they might have lived the rest of their lives hoping I'd come back, searching, believing I would one day return.</p><p>The undertaker arrived and cleared the room of visitors. He and a nurse undressed me and examined my body. Some of my senses were returning and I could feel his cold hands prodding and poking me.</p><p>\"He's in excellent condition,\" he said softly to the nurse. \"Firm, fresh, and unmarked. I'll have very little to do with this one. Just some rouge to make him look a little redder around the cheeks.\"</p><p>He rolled up my eyelids. He was a chubby, happy-looking man. I was afraid he'd spot life in my eyes but he didn't. All he did was roll my head gently from side to side, which made the broken bones in my neck creak.</p><p>\"So fragile a creature is man,\" he sighed, then went ahead with the rest of the examination.</p><p>They took me back home that night and laid me in the living room on a long table with a large cloth spread across it, so people could come and say goodbye.</p><p>It was weird, hearing all those people discussing me as though I weren't there, talking about my life and what I'd been like as a baby and how fine a boy I was and what a good man I would have grown up to be if I'd lived.</p><p>What a shock they'd have gotten if I leaped up and shouted: \"Boo!\"</p><p>Time dragged. I don't think I can explain how boring it was to lie still for hours on end, unable to move or laugh or scratch my nose. I couldn't even stare at the ceiling because my eyes were shut!</p><p>I had to be careful as feelings returned to my body. Mr. Crepsley had told me this would happen, that tingles and itches would start, long before I fully recovered. I couldn't move, but if I'd made a real effort, I could have twitched a little, which might have given me away.</p><p>The itches nearly drove me crazy. I tried ignoring them but it was impossible. They were everywhere, scampering up and down my body like tiny spiders. They were worst around my head and neck, where the bones had snapped.</p>","<p>People finally began leaving. It must have been late, because soon the room was empty and totally silent. I lay there by myself for a time, enjoying the quiet.</p><p>And then I heard a noise.</p><p>The door to the room was opening, very slowly and very quietly.</p><p>Footsteps crossed the room and stopped by the table. My insides went cold, and it wasn't because of the potion. Who was here? For a moment I thought it might be Mr. Crepsley but he had no reason to come creeping into the house. We were set to meet at a later date.</p><p>Whoever it was, he or she was keeping very quiet. For a couple of minutes there was no sound at all.</p><p>Then I felt hands on my face.</p><p>He raised my eyelids and shined a small flashlight onto my pupils. The room was too dark for me to see who he was. He grunted, lowered the lids, then pried open my mouth and laid something on my tongue: it felt like a piece of thin paper but it had a strange, bitter taste.</p><p>After removing the object from my mouth, he picked up my hands and examined the fingertips. Next there was the sound of a camera taking photos.</p><p>Finally he stuck a sharp object it felt like a needle into me. He was careful not to prick me in places where I would bleed, and stayed away from my vital organs. My senses had partially returned, but not fully, so the needle didn't cause much pain.</p><p>After that, he left. I heard his footsteps crossing the room, as quietly as before, then the door opening and closing, and that was that. The visitor, whoever it had been, was gone, leaving me puzzled and a little bit scared.</p><p>Early the next morning, Dad came in and sat with me. He spoke for a long time, telling me all the things he'd had planned for me, the college I would have gone to, the job he'd wanted for me. He cried a lot.</p><p>Toward the end, Mom came in and sat with him. They cried on each other's shoulders and tried to comfort themselves. They said they still had Annie and could maybe have another child or adopt one. At least it had been quick and I hadn't been in pain. And they would always have their memories.</p><p>I hated being the cause of so much hurt. I would have given anything in the world to spare them this.</p><p>There was a lot of activity later that day. A coffin was brought in and I was laid inside. A priest came and sat with the family and their friends. People streamed in and out of the room.</p><p>I heard Annie crying, begging me to stop fooling and sit up. It would have been much easier if they'd taken her away, but I guess they didn't want her to grow up feeling they'd robbed her of her chance to say good-bye to her brother.</p><p>Finally, the lid was placed on the coffin and screwed into place. I was lifted off the table and led out to the hearse. We drove slowly to church, where I couldn't hear much of what was being said. Then, with Mass out of the way, they carried me to the graveyard, where I could hear every word of the priest's speech and the sobs and moans of the mourners.</p><p>And then they buried me.</p><p>Chapter THIRTY-ONE</p><p>ALL SOUNDS FADED AWAY AS they lowered me down the dark, dank hole. There was a jolt when the coffin hit bottom, then the rainlike sound of the first hand-fuls of soil being tossed upon the lid.</p><p>There was a long silence after that, until the grave diggers began shoveling the earth back into the grave.</p><p>The first few shovelfuls fell like bricks. The heavy dull thuds shook the coffin. As the grave filled and earth piled up between me and the topside world, the sounds of the living grew softer, until finally they were only faraway muffles.</p><p>At the end there were faint pounding noises, as they patted the mound of earth flat.</p><p>And then complete silence.</p><p>I lay in the quiet darkness, listening to the earth settle, imagining the sound of worms crawling toward me through the dirt. I'd thought it would be scary but it was actually quite peaceful. I felt safe down here, protected from the world.</p><p>I spent the time thinking about the last few weeks, the flyer for the freak show, the strange force that had made me close my eyes and reach blindly for the ticket, my first glimpse of the dark theater, the cool balcony where I had watched Steve talking with Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>There were so many important moments. If I'd missed the ticket, I wouldn't be here. If I hadn't gone to the show, I wouldn't be here. If I hadn't stuck around to see what Steve was up to, I wouldn't be here. If I hadn't stolen Madam Octa, I wouldn't be here. If I'd said no to Mr. Crepsley's offer, I wouldn't be here.</p><p>A world of \"ifs,\" but it made no difference. What was done was done. If I could go back in time...</p><p>But I couldn't. The past was behind me. The best thing now would be to stop looking over my shoulder. It was time to forget the past and look to the present and future.</p><p>As the hours passed, movement returned. It came to my fingers first, which curled into fists, then slipped from my chest, where they had been crossed by the undertaker. I flexed them several times, slowly, working the itches out of my palms.</p><p>My eyes opened next but that wasn't much good. Open or closed, it was all the same down here: perfect darkness.</p><p>The feelings brought pain. My back ached from where I'd fallen out of the window. My lungs, and heart having been out of the habit of beating hurt. My legs were cramped, my neck was stiff. The only part of me that escaped the pain was my right big toe!</p><p>It was when I started breathing that I began to worry about the air in the coffin. Mr. Crepsley had said I could survive for up to a week in my coma-like state. I didn't need to eat or use the toilet or breathe. But now that my breath was back, I became aware of the small amount of air and how quickly I was using it up.</p><p>I didn't panic. Panic would make me gasp and use more air. I remained calm and breathed softly. Lay as still as I could: movement makes you breathe more.</p><p>I had no way of knowing the time. I tried counting inside my head but kept losing track of the numbers and having to go back and start over.</p><p>I sang silent songs to myself and told stories beneath my breath. I wished they'd buried me with a TV or a radio, but I guess there's not much call for such items among the dead.</p><p>Finally, after what seemed like several centuries stacked one on top of the other, the sounds of digging reached my ears.</p><p>He dug quicker than any human, so fast it seemed he wasn't digging at all, but rather sucking the soil out. He reached me in what must have been record time, less than fifteen minutes. As far as I was concerned, it wasn't a moment too soon.</p><p>He knocked three times on the coffin lid, then started unscrewing it. It took a couple of minutes, then he threw the lid wide open and I found myself staring up at the most beautiful night sky I had ever seen.</p>","<p>I took a deep breath and sat up, coughing. It was a fairly dark night but after spending so much time underground it seemed bright as day to me.</p><p>\"Are you all right?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"I feel dead tired.\" I grinned weakly.</p><p>He smiled at the joke. \"Stand up so I can examine you,\" he said. I winced as I stood: I had pins and needles all over. He ran his fingers lightly up my back, then over my front. \"You were lucky,\" he said. \"No broken bones. Just a bit of bruising, which will die down after a couple of days.\"</p><p>He pulled himself up out of the grave, then reached down and gave me a hand up. I was still pretty stiff and sore.</p><p>\"I feel like a pincushion that's been squashed,\" I complained.</p><p>\"It will take a few days for the aftereffects to pass,\" he said. \"But do not worry: you are in good shape. We are lucky they buried you today. If they had waited another day to put you under, you would be feeling much worse.\"</p><p>He hopped back into the grave and closed the coffin lid. When he emerged, he picked up his shovel and began tossing the earth back in.</p><p>\"Do you want me to help?\" I asked.</p><p>\"No,\" he said. \"You would slow me down. Go for a stroll and walk some of the stiffness out of your bones. I will call when I am ready to move on.\"</p><p>\"Did you bring my bag?\" I asked.</p><p>He nodded at a nearby headstone, from which the bag was hanging.</p><p>I got the bag and checked to see if he'd searched it. There was no sign of his having invaded my privacy, but I couldn't tell for sure. I'd just have to take him at his word. Anyway, it didn't matter much: there was nothing in my diary he didn't already know.</p><p>I went for a walk among the graves, testing my limbs, shaking my legs and arms, enjoying it. Any feeling, even pins and needles, was better than none at all.</p><p>My eyes were stronger than ever before. I was able to read names and dates on headstones from several yards away. It was the vampire blood in me. After all, didn't vampires spend their whole lives in the dark? I knew I was only a half-vampire, but all the suddenly, as I was thinking about my new powers, a hand reached out from behind one of the graves, wrapped itself around my mouth, then dragged me down to the ground and out of sight of Mr. Crepsley!</p><p>I shook my head and opened my mouth to scream, but then saw something that stopped me dead in my tracks. My attacker, whoever he was, had a hammer and a large wooden stake, the tip of which was pointing directly at my heart!</p><p>Chapter THIRTY-TWO</p><p>IF YOU MOVE EVEN A fraction,\" my attacker warned, \"I'll drive this right through you without blinking!\"</p><p>The chilling words didn't have half as much impact on me as the familiar voice that uttered them.</p><p>\"Steve!\" I gasped, glancing up from the tip of the stake to find his face. It was him, sure enough, trying to look brave, but obviously terrified. \"Steve, what the...\" I began but he cut me short with a poke of the stake.</p><p>\"Not a word!\" he hissed, crouching down behind the stone pillar. \"I don't want your friend overhearing.\"</p><p>\"My...? Oh, you mean Mr. Crepsley,\" I said.</p><p>\"Larten Crepsley, Vur Horston,\" Steve sneered. \"I don't care what you call him. He's a vampire. That's all that bothers me.\"</p><p>\"What are you doing here?\" I whispered.</p><p>\"Vampire hunting,\" he growled, prodding me again with the stake. \"And lookee here: seems like I found me a pair!\"</p><p>\"Listen,\" I said, more annoyed than worried (if he was going to kill me, he would have done it immediately, not sat around talking first, like they do in the movies), \"if you're going to stick that thing in me, do it. If you want to talk, put it away. I'm sore enough as it is without you making new holes in me.\"</p><p>He stared, then pulled the stake back a few centimeters.</p><p>\"Why are you here?\" I asked. \"How did you know to come?\"</p><p>\"I was following you,\" he said. \"I followed you all weekend after seeing what you did to Alan. I saw Crepsley going into your house. I saw him toss you out the window.\"</p><p>\"You're the one who sneaked into the living room!\" I gasped, remembering the mysterious late-night visitor.</p><p>\"Yes.\" He nodded. \"The doctors were very quick to sign your death certificate. I wanted to check for myself, to see if you were still ticking.\"</p><p>\"The piece of paper in my mouth?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Litmus paper,\" he said. \"It changes color when you stick it on a damp surface. When you stick it on a living body. That and the marks on the fingers tipped me off.\"</p><p>\"You know about the marks on the fingers?\" I asked, amazed.</p><p>\"I read about it in a very old book,\" he said. \"The same one, in fact, that I found Vur Horston's portrait in. There was no mention of it anywhere else, so I thought it was just another vampire myth. But then I studied your fingers and...\"</p><p>He stopped and cocked his head. I realized I could no longer hear digging sounds. For a moment there was silence. Then Mr. Crepsley's voice hissed across the graveyard.</p><p>\"Darren, where are you?\" he called. \"Darren?\"</p><p>Steve's face collapsed with fear. I could hear his heart beating and see the beads of sweat rolling down his cheeks. He didn't know what to do. He hadn't thought this through.</p><p>\"I'm fine,\" I shouted, causing Steve to jump.</p><p>\"Where are you?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"Over here,\" I replied, standing, ignoring Steve's stake. \"My legs were weak, so I lay down for a minute.\"</p><p>\"Are you all right?\" he asked.</p><p>\"I'm fine,\" I said. \"I'll rest a little longer, then try them again. Give me a shout when you're ready.\"</p><p>I squatted back down so I was face to face with Steve. He didn't look so brave anymore. The tip of the stake was pointing down at the ground, a threat no more, and his whole body sagged miserably. I felt sorry for him.</p><p>\"Why did you come here, Steve?\" I asked.</p><p>\"To kill you,\" he said.</p><p>\"To kill me? For heaven's sake, why?\" I asked.</p><p>\"You're a vampire,\" he said. \"What other reason do I need?\"</p><p>\"But you've got nothing against vampires,\" I reminded him. \"You wanted to become one.\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" he snarled. \"I wanted to, but you're the one who did. You planned this all along, didn't you? You told him I was evil. You made him reject me so that you could...\"</p>","<p>\"You're talking nonsense.\" I sighed. \"I never wanted to become a vampire. I only agreed to join him in order to save your life. You would have died if I hadn't become his assistant.\"</p><p>\"A likely story,\" he snorted. \"To think I used to believe you were my friend. Ha!\"</p><p>\"I am your friend!\" I cried. \"Steve, you don't understand. I would never do anything to harm you. I hate what's happened to me. I only did it to...\"</p><p>\"Spare me the sob story,\" he sniffed. \"How long were you planning this? You must have gone to him that night of the freak show. That's how you got Madam Octa, wasn't it? He gave her to you in return for your becoming his assistant.\"</p><p>\"No, Steve, that's not true. You mustn't believe that.\" But he did believe it. I could see it in his eyes. Nothing I said was going to change his opinion. As far as he was concerned, I'd betrayed him. I had stolen the life he felt should have been his. He would never forgive me.</p><p>\"I'm going now,\" he said, starting to crawl away. \"I thought I'd be able to kill you tonight, but I was wrong. I'm too young. I'm not strong enough or brave enough.</p><p>\"But heed this, Darren Shan,\" he said. \"I'll grow. I'll get older and stronger and braver. I'm going to devote my entire life to developing my body and my mind, and when the day comes...when I'm ready...when I'm fully equipped and properly prepared...</p><p>\"I'm going to hunt you down and kill you\" he vowed. \"I'm going to become the world's best vampire hunter and there won't be a single hole you can find that I won't be able to find, too. Not a hole or a rock or a cellar.</p><p>\"I'll track you to the ends of the Earth if I have to.\" he said, his face glowing madly. \"You and your mentor. And when I find you, I'll drive steel-tipped stakes through your hearts, then chop off your heads and fill them with garlic. Then I'll burn you to ashes and scatter you across running water. I won't take any chances. I'll make sure you never come back from the grave again!\"</p><p>He paused, produced a knife, and cut a small cross into the flesh of his left palm. He held it up so I could see the blood dripping from the wound.</p><p>\"On this blood, I swear it!\" he declared, then turned and ran, disappearing in seconds into the shadows of the night.</p><p>I could have run after him, following the trail of blood. If I'd called Mr. Crepsley, we could have tracked him down and put an end to both Steve Leopard and his threats. It would have been the wise thing to do.</p><p>But I didn't. I couldn't. He was my friend...</p><p>Chapter THIRTY-THREE</p><p>MR. CREPSLEY WAS SMOOTHING OVER the mound of earth when I returned. I watched him work. The shovel was large and heavy but he handled it as if it were made out of paper. I wondered how strong he was and how strong I would one day be.</p><p>I considered telling him about Steve but was afraid he'd go after him. Steve had suffered enough. Besides, his threat was an idle one. He'd forget about me and Mr. Crepsley in a few weeks, when something new grabbed his attention.</p><p>I hoped.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley looked up and frowned. \"Are you sure you are all right?\" he asked. \"You seem very uptight.\"</p><p>\"So would you if you'd spent the day in a coffin,\" I replied.</p><p>He laughed out loud. \"Master Shan, I have spent more time in coffins than many of the truly dead!\" He gave the grave one last hard whack, then broke the shovel into little pieces and tossed them away. \"Is the stiffness wearing off?\" he asked.</p><p>\"It's better than it was,\" I said, twisting my arms and waist. \"I wouldn't like to fake my death too often, though.\"</p><p>\"No,\" he mused. \"Well, hopefully it will not be necessary again. It is a dangerous stunt. Many things can go wrong.\"</p><p>I stared at him. \"You told me I'd be safe,\" I said.</p><p>\"I lied. The potion sometimes drives its patients too far toward death and they never recover. And I could not be sure they would not perform an autopsy on you. And...Do you want to hear all this?\" he asked.</p><p>\"No,\" I said sickly. \"I don't.\" I took an angry swing at him. He ducked out of the way easily, laughing as he did.</p><p>\"You told me it was safe!\" I shouted. \"You lied!\"</p><p>\"I had to,\" he said. \"There was no other way.\"</p><p>\"What if I'd died?\" I snapped.</p><p>He shrugged. \"I would be down one assistant. No great loss. I am sure I could have found another.\"</p><p>\"You...you...Oh!\" I kicked the ground angrily. There were lots of things I could have called him but I didn't like using bad language in the presence of the dead. I'd tell him what I thought about his trickery later.</p><p>\"Are you ready to go?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Give me a minute,\" I said. I jumped up on one of the taller headstones and gazed around at the town. I couldn't see much from here but this would be my last glimpse of the place where I had been born and lived, so I took my time and treated every dark alley as a posh cul-de-sac, every crumbling house as a sheik's palace, every two-story building as a skyscraper.</p><p>\"You will grow used to leaving after a time,\" Mr. Crepsley said. He was standing on the stone behind me, perched on little more than thin air. His face was gloomy. \"Vampires are always saying good-bye. We never stop anywhere very long. We are forever picking up our roots and moving on to new pastures. It is our way.\"</p><p>\"Is the first time the hardest?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he said, nodding. \"But it never gets easy.\"</p><p>\"How long before I get used to it?\" I wanted to know.</p><p>\"Maybe a few decades,\" he said. \"Maybe longer.\"</p><p>Decades. He said it as though he was talking of months.</p><p>\"Can't we ever make friends?\" I asked. \"Can't we ever have homes or wives or families?\"</p><p>\"No,\" he sighed. \"Never.\"</p><p>\"Does it get lonely?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Terribly so,\" he admitted.</p><p>I nodded sadly. At least he was being truthful. As I've said before, I'd always rather the truth however unpleasant it might be than a lie. You know where you stand with the truth.</p><p>\"Okay,\" I said, hopping down. \"I'm ready.\" I picked up my bag and dusted some graveyard dirt from it.</p><p>\"You may ride on my back if you wish,\" Mr. Crepsley offered.</p><p>\"No, thank you,\" I replied politely. \"Maybe later, but I'd rather walk the stiffness out of my legs first.\"</p>","<p>\"Very well,\" he said.</p><p>I rubbed my belly and listened to it growl. \"I haven't eaten since Sunday,\" I told him. \"I'm hungry.\"</p><p>\"Me too,\" he said. Then he took my hand in his and grinned bloodthirstily. \"Let us go eat.\"</p><p>I took a deep breath and tried not to think about what would be on the menu. I nodded nervously and squeezed his hand. We turned and faced away from the graves. Then, side by side, the vampire and his assistant, we began walking... into the night.</p><p>TO BE CONTINUED in book 2.</p>"]},{"title":"The Vampire's Assistant","pages":["<p>Chapter One</p><p>It was a dry, warm night, and Stanley Collins had decided to walk home after the Boy Scouts meeting. It wasn't a very long walk - less than a mile - and though the night was dark, he knew every step of the way as surely as he knew how to tie a reef knot.</p><p>Stanley was a scoutmaster. He loved the Scouts. He'd been one when he was a boy and kept in contact when he grew up. He'd turned his own three sons into first-rate Scouts, and now that they'd grown up and left home, he was helping the local kids.</p><p>Stanley walked quickly to keep warm. He was only wearing shorts and a T-shirt, and even though it was a nice night, his arms and legs were soon covered in goosebumps. He didn't mind. His wife would have a delicious cup of hot chocolate and cookies waiting for him when he got home. He'd enjoy them all the more after a good, brisk walk.</p><p>Trees grew along both sides of the road home, making it very dark and dangerous for anyone who wasn't used to it. But Stanley had no fears. On the contrary, he loved the night. He enjoyed listening to the sound of his feet crunching through the grass and briars.</p><p>Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.</p><p>He smiled. When his sons were young, he'd often pretended there were monsters lying in wait up in the trees as they walked home. He'd make scary noises and shake the leaves of low-hanging branches when the boys weren't looking. Sometimes they'd burst into screams and run for home at top speed, and Stanley would follow after them, laughing.</p><p>Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.</p><p>Sometimes, if he was having trouble getting to sleep at night, he would imagine the sounds of his feet as they made their way home, and that always helped him drift off into a happy dream.</p><p>Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.</p><p>It was the nicest sound in the world, as far as Stanley was concerned. It was a great feeling, to know you were all alone and safe as can be.</p><p>Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.</p><p>Snap.</p><p>Stanley stopped and frowned. That had sounded like a stick breaking - but how could it have been? He would have felt it if he'd stepped on a twig. And there were no cows or sheep in the nearby fields.</p><p>He stood still for about half a minute, listening curiously. When there were no more sounds, he shook his head and smiled. It had been his imagination playing tricks on him, that was all. He'd tell the wife about it when he got home and they'd have a good old laugh.</p><p>He started walking again.</p><p>Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.</p><p>There. Back to the familiar sounds. There was nobody else around. He would have heard more than a single branch snapping if there was. Nobody could creep up on Stanley J. Collins. He was a trained scoutmaster. His ears were as sharp as a fox's.</p><p>Crunch. Crunch. Crunch. Crunch. Cru -</p><p>Snap.</p><p>Stanley stopped again and, for the first time, the fingers of fear began to squeeze around his beating heart.</p><p>That hadn't been his imagination. He'd heard it, clear as a bell. A twig snapping, somewhere overhead. And before it snapped - had there been the slightest rustling sound, like something moving?</p><p>Stanley gazed up at the trees but it was too dark to see. There could have been a monster the size of a car up there and he wouldn't have been able to spot it. Ten monsters! A hundred! A thou-</p><p>Oh, that was silly. There were no monsters in the trees. Monsters didn't exist. Everyone knew that. Monsters weren't real. It was a squirrel or an owl up there, something ordinary like that.</p><p>Stanley raised a foot and began to bring it down.</p><p>Snap.</p><p>His foot hung in the air, midstep, and his heart pounded quickly. That was no squirrel! The sound was too sharp. Something big was up there. Something that shouldn't be up there. Something that had never been up there before. Something that -</p><p>Snap!</p><p>The sound was closer this time, lower down, and suddenly Stanley could stand it no longer.</p><p>He began to run.</p><p>Stanley was a large man, but pretty fit for his age. Still, it had been a long time since he'd run this fast, and after a hundred yards he was out of breath and had a cramp in his side.</p><p>He slowed to a halt and bent over, gasping for air.</p><p>Crunch.</p><p>His head shot up.</p><p>Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.</p><p>There were footsteps coming toward him! Slow, heavy footsteps. Stanley listened, terrified, as they came closer and closer. Had the monster leaped ahead of him through the trees? Had it climbed down? Was it coming to finish him off? Was it...?</p><p>Crunch. Crunch.</p><p>The footsteps stopped and Stanley was able to make out a figure in the darkness. It was smaller than he'd expected, no bigger than a boy. He took a deep breath, straightened up, got his courage up, and stepped forward for a better look.</p><p>It was only a boy! A small, frightened-looking boy, dressed in a dirty suit.</p><p>Stanley smiled and shook his head. What a fool he'd been! The wife would have a field day when he told her about this.</p><p>\"Are you okay, son?\"Stanley asked him.</p><p>The boy didn't answer.</p><p>Stanley didn't recognize the youngster, but there were a lot of new families around these days. He no longer knew every child in the neighborhood.</p><p>\"Can I help you?\"he asked. \"Are you lost?\"</p><p>The boy shook his head slowly. There was something strange about him. Something that suddenly made Stanley feel uneasy. It might have been the effect of the darkness and the shadows...but the boy looked very pale, very thin, very...hungry.</p><p>\"Are you all right?\"Stanley asked again, stepping closer. \"Can I-\"</p><p>Snap!</p><p>The sound came from directly overhead, loud and menacing. The boy leaped back quickly, out of the way.</p><p>Stanley just had time to glance up and see a huge red shape, which might have been some sort of bat, falling through the branches of the trees, almost faster than his eyes could follow.</p><p>And then the red thing was on him. Stanley opened his mouth to scream, but before he could, the monster's hands - claws? - clamped over his mouth. There was a brief struggle, then Stanley was sliding onto the ground, unconscious, unseeing, unknowing.</p><p>Above him, the two creatures of the night moved in for the feed.</p><p>Chapter two</p><p>\"Imagine a man his age wearing a Scout's uniform,\" Mr. Crepsley snorted as he turned our victim over.</p><p>\"Were you ever in the Scouts?\" I asked.</p><p>\"They did not have them in my day,\" he replied. He patted the man's meaty legs and grunted. \"Plenty of blood in this one, \"he said.</p><p>I watched as Mr. Crepsley searched the leg for a vein, then cut it open---a small slice-using one of his fingernails. As soon as blood oozed out, he clamped his mouth around the cut and sucked. He didn't believe in wasting any of the \"precious red mercury,\" as he sometimes called it. I stood uncertainly by his side as he drank. This was the third time I'd taken part in attack, but I still wasn't used to the sight of the vampire sucking blood from a helpless human being. It had been almost two months since my \"death\" but I was having a tough time adjusting to the change. It was hard to believe my old way of life was finished, that I was a half-vampire and could never go back. I knew I had to eventually leave my human side behind. But it was easier said than done. Mr. Crepsley lifted his head and licked his lips.</p><p>\"A good vintage,\" he joked, shuffling back from the body.\"Your turn,\" he said. I took a step forward, then stopped and shook my head.</p><p>\"I can't,\" I said.</p><p>\"Do not be stupid,\" he growled. \" You have shied away twice already. It is time you drank.\"</p><p>\"I can't\" I cried.</p><p>\"You have drunk animal blood,\" he said.</p><p>\"That's different. This a human.\"</p><p>\"So what?\" Mr. Crepsley snapped. \"We are not. You have to start treating humans the same as animals, Darren. Vampires cannot live on animal blood alone. If you do not start drinking human blood, you will grow weak. If you continue to avoid it, you will die.\"</p><p>\"I know,\" I said miserably.\"You've explained it to me. And I know we don't hurt those we drink from, not unless we drink too much. But...\"I shrugged unhappily. He sighed.\"Very well. It is hard, especially when you are only a half-vampire and the hunger is not so great. I will let you abstain this time. But you must feed soon. For your own sake.\"</p><p>He returned to the cut and cleaned away the blood-which had been leaking out while we were talking-from around the man's leg. Then he worked up a mouthful of spit and slowly let it dribble over the cut. He rubbed it in with a finger, then sat back and watched. The wound closed and healed. Within a minute there was</p><p>nothing left besides a small scar that the man probably wouldn't notice when he awoke.</p><p>That's how vampires protect themselves. Unlike in the movies, they don't kill people when they drink, not unless they are starving or get carried away and go too far. They drink in small doses, a little here, a little there. Sometimes they attack people out in the open, as we had just done. Other times, they creep into bedrooms late at night or into hospital wards or police cells.</p><p>The people they drink from hardly ever know they've been fed on by a vampire. When this man woke, he would remember only a falling red shape. He wouldn't be able to explain why'd passed out or what had happened to him while he was unconscious. If he found the scar, he'd be more likely to think it was the mark of aliens than a vampire.</p><p>Hah.Aliens ! Not many people know that vampires started the UFO stories. It was the perfect cover. People all over the world were waking up to find strange scars on their bodies and were blaming it on imaginary aliens. Mr. Crepsley had knocked the scoutmaster out with his breath. Vampires can breathe out a special kind of gas, which makes people faint. When Mr. Crepsley wanted to put someone to sleep, he breathed into a cupped fist, then held his hand over the person's nose and mouth. Seconds later they were down for the count, and wouldn't wake for at least twenty or thirty minutes.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley examined the scar and made sure it had healed correctly. He took good care of his victims. He seemed to be a nice guy, from what I'd seen of him- a part from the fact that he was a vampire!</p><p>\"Come,\" he said, standing. \"The night is young. We will go find a rabbit or a fox for for you.\"</p><p>\"You don't mind me not drinking from him\" I asked.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley shook his head. \"You will drink eventually,\" he said.\"When you are hungry enough.\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said silently behind him, as he turned to walk away.\"I won't. Not from a human. I'll never drink from a human.N ever!\"</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>I woke up early in the afternoon, as usual. I'd gone to bed shortly before dawn, the same time as Mr. Crepsley. But while he had to stay asleep until night came again, I was free to rise and move around in the daylight world. It was one of the advantages of being only a half-vampire.</p><p>I made a late breakfast of butter on a bagel - even vampires have to eat normal food; blood alone won't keep us going - and plopped down in front of the hotel TV. Mr. Crepsley didn't like hotels. He usually slept out in the open, in an old barn or a ruined building or a large crypt, but I was having no part of that. I told him point blank after a week of sleeping in the cold that I'd had enough of it. He grumbled a bit, but finally gave in.</p><p>The last two months had passed pretty quickly, because I'd been so busy learning about being a vampire's assistant. Mr. Crepsley wasn't a good teacher and didn't like repeating himself, so I had to pay attention and learn fast.</p><p>I was really strong now. I could lift huge weights and crush marbles to pieces with my fingers. If I shook hands with a human I had to be careful not to break the bones in his fingers. I could do chin-ups all night long and throw a baseball farther than any grown-up. (I measured my throw one day, then checked in a book and discovered I'd set a new world record! I was excited at first, but then realized I couldn't tell anybody about it. Still, it was nice to know I was a world champion.)</p><p>My fingernails were really thick, and the only way I could cut them was with my teeth; clippers and scissors were no good on my new, tough nails. They were a pain: I kept ripping my clothes when I was putting them on or taking them off and digging holes in my pockets when I stuck my hands in.</p><p>We'd covered a lot of distance since that night in the cemetery. First we'd fled at top vampire speed, me on Mr. Crepsley's back, invisible to human eyes, gliding across the land like a couple of high-speed ghosts. That's called flitting. But flitting is tiring work, so after a couple of nights we began taking trains and buses.</p><p>I don't know where Mr. Crepsley got the money for our travel and hotels and food. He had no wallet that I could see and no bank cards, but every time he had to pay for something, out came the cash.</p><p>I hadn't grown fangs. I'd been expecting them to sprout and had been checking my teeth in the mirror every night for three weeks before Mr. Crepsley caught me.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\"he asked.</p><p>\"Looking for fangs,\"I told him.</p><p>He stared at me for a few seconds, then burst out laughing. \"We do not grow fangs, you idiot!\"he roared.</p><p>\"But... how do we bite people?\"I asked, confused.</p><p>\"We do not,\"he told me, still laughing. \"We cut them with our nails and suck the blood out. We only use our teeth in emergencies.\"</p><p>\"So I won't grow fangs?\"</p><p>\"No. Your teeth will be harder than any human's, and you will be able to bite through skin and bone if you wish, but it is messy. Only stupid vampires use their teeth. And stupid vampires tend not to last very long. They get hunted down and killed.\"</p><p>I was a little disappointed to hear that. It was one of the things I liked most about those old vampire movies: The vampires looked so cool when they bared their fangs.</p><p>But after some thought, I decided I was better off without the fangs. The fingernails making holes in my clothes were bad enough. I would have been in real trouble if my teeth had grown and I'd started cutting chunks out of my cheeks as well!</p>","<p>Most of the old vampire stories were untrue. We couldn't change shape or fly. Crosses and holy water didn't hurt us. All garlic did was give us bad breath. Our reflections could be seen in mirrors, and we cast shadows.</p><p>Some of the myths were true, though. A vampire couldn't be photographed or filmed with a video camera. There's something odd about vampire atoms, which means all that comes out on film is a dark blur. I could still be photographed, but you wouldn't get a clear photo of me, no matter how good the light.</p><p>Vampires were friendly with rats and bats. We couldn't turn into them, as some books and films said, but they liked us - they knew from the smell of our blood that we were different from humans - and often cuddled up to us while we were sleeping, or came around looking for scraps of food.</p><p>Dogs and cats, for some reason, hated us.</p><p>Sunlight would kill a vampire, but not quickly. A vampire could walk around during the day, if he wrapped up in lots of clothes. He'd tan really fast and start to go red within fifteen minutes. Four or five hours of sunlight would kill him.</p><p>A stake through the heart would kill us, of course, but so would a bullet or a knife or electricity. We could drown or be crushed to death or catch certain diseases. We were tougher to kill than normal people, but we weren't indestructible.</p><p>There was more I had to learn. A lot more. Mr. Crepsley said it would be years before I knew everything and was able to function by myself. He said a half-vampire who didn't know what he was doing would be dead within a couple of months, so I had to stick to him like glue, even if I didn't want to.</p><p>When I finished my bagel, I sat and bit my nails for a few hours. There wasn't anything good on TV, but I didn't want to go outside, not without Mr. Crepsley. We were in a small town, and people made me nervous. I kept expecting them to see through me, to know what I was and to come after me with stakes.</p><p>When night came, Mr. Crepsley emerged and rubbed his belly. \"I am starving,\"he said. \"I know it is early, but let us head out now. I should have taken more of that silly Scout-man's blood. I think I will track down another human.\"He looked at me with one eyebrow raised. \"Maybe you will join me this time.\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\"I said, though I knew I wouldn't. It was the one thing I'd sworn I would never do. I might have to drink the blood of animals to stay alive, but I would never feast on one of my own kind, no matter what Mr. Crepsley said, or how much my belly growled. I was half vampire, yes, but I was also half human, and the thought of attacking a living person filled me with horror and disgust.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>Blood...</p><p>Mr. Crepsley spent a lot of his time teaching me about blood. It's vital to vampires. Without it we grow weak and old and die. Blood keeps us young. Vampires age at a tenth the human rate (for every ten years that pass vampires only age one), but without human blood, we age even quicker than humans, maybe twenty or thirty years within a year or two. As a half-vampire, who aged at a fifth the human rate, I didn't have to drink as much human blood as Mr. Crepsley - but I would have to drink some to live.</p><p>The blood of animals - dogs, cows, sheep - keeps vampires going, but there are some animals they - we - can't drink from: cats, for instance. If a vampire drinks a cat's blood, he might as well pour poison down his throat. We also can't drink from monkeys, frogs, most fish, or snakes.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley hadn't told me the names of all the dangerous animals. There were a whole lot, and it would take time to learn them all. His advice was to always ask before I tried something new.</p><p>Vampires have to feed on humans about once a month. Most feast once a week. That way, they don't have to suck much blood. If you only feed once a month, you have to drink a lot of blood at one time.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley said it was dangerous to go too long without drinking. He said the thirst could make you drink more than you meant to, and then you were probably going to end up killing the person you drank from.</p><p>\"A vampire who feasts frequently can control himself,\"he said. \"One who drinks only when he must will end up sucking wildly. The hunger inside us must be fed to be controlled.\"</p><p>Fresh blood was the best. If you drink from a living human, the blood is full of goodness and you don't need to take very much. But blood begins to go sour when a person dies. If you drink from a dead body, you have to drink a lot more.</p><p>\"The general rule is, never drink from a person who has been dead more than a day,\"Mr. Crepsley explained.</p><p>\"How will I know how long a person's been dead?\"I asked.</p><p>\"The taste of the blood,\"he said. \"You will learn to tell good blood from bad. Bad blood is like sour milk, only worse.\"</p><p>\"Is drinking bad blood dangerous?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Yes. It will sicken you, maybe turn you crazy or even kill you.\"</p><p>Brrrr!</p><p>We could bottle fresh blood and keep it for as long as we liked, for use in emergencies. Mr. Crepsley had a few bottles of blood stored in his cloak. He sometimes had one with a meal, as if it were a small bottle of wine.</p><p>\"Could you survive on bottled blood alone?\"I asked one night.</p><p>\"For a while,\"he said. \"But not in the long run.\"</p><p>\"How do you bottle it?\"I asked, examining one of the glass bottles. It was like a test tube, only the glass was darker and thicker.</p><p>\"It is tricky,\"he said. \"I will show you how it is done, the next time I am filling up.\"</p><p>Blood...</p><p>It was what I needed most, but also what I feared most. If I drank a human's blood, there was no going back. I'd be a vampire for life. If I avoided it, I might become a human again. Maybe the vampire blood in my veins would wear out. Maybe I wouldn't die. Maybe only the vampire in me would die, and then I could go home to my family and friends.</p><p>It wasn't much of a hope - Mr. Crepsley had said it was impossible to become human again - but it was the only dream I had to hold on to.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>Days and nights passed, and we moved on. We wandered from towns to villages to cities. I wasn't getting along very well with Mr. Crepsley. Nice as he was, I couldn't forget that he was the one who'd pumped vampire blood into my veins and made it impossible for me to stay with my family.</p><p>I hated him. Sometimes, during the day, I'd think about driving a stake through his heart while he was sleeping, and running away. I might have, too, except I knew I couldn't survive without him. For the moment I needed Larten Crepsley. But when the day came that I could look after myself...</p><p>I was in charge of Madam Octa. I had to find food for her and exercise her and clean out her cage. I didn't want to - I hated the spider almost as much as I hated the vampire - but Mr. Crepsley said I was the one who'd stolen her, so I had to look after her.</p><p>I practiced a few tricks with her every now and then, but my heart wasn't in it. She didn't interest me anymore, and as the weeks went by I played with her less and less.</p><p>The one good thing about being on the road was being able to visit a whole bunch of places I hadn't been before and see a lot of cool sights. I loved traveling. But, since we traveled at night, I didn't get to see many of our surroundings - bummer!</p><p>One day, while Mr. Crepsley was sleeping, I got tired of being indoors. I left a note on the TV, in case I wasn't back when he woke up, then left. I only had a little money and had no idea where I would go, but that didn't matter. Just getting out of the hotel and spending some time by myself was wonderful.</p><p>It was a large town but pretty quiet. I checked out a few arcades and played some video games in them. I'd never been very good at video games before, but with my new reflexes and skills I was able to do pretty much anything I wanted.</p><p>I raced through all levels, knocked out every opponent in martial arts tournaments, and zapped all the aliens attacking from the skies in the sci-fi adventures.</p><p>After that I toured the town. There were plenty of fountains and statues and parks and museums, all of which I checked out with interest. But going around the museums reminded me of Mom - she loved taking me to museums - and that upset me: I always felt lonely and miserable when I thought of Mom, Dad, or Annie.</p><p>I spotted a group of guys my age playing hockey on a cement playground. There were eight players on each side. Most had plastic sticks, though a few had wooden ones. They were using an old tennis ball as a puck.</p><p>I stopped to watch, and after a few minutes one of the guys came over to me.</p><p>\"Where are you from?\"he asked.</p><p>\"Out of town,\"I said. \"I'm staying at a hotel with my father.\"I hated calling Mr. Crepsley that, but it was the safest thing to say.</p><p>\"He's from out of town,\"the boy called back to the other guys, who had stopped playing.</p><p>\"Is he part of the Addams Family?\"one of them shouted back, and they all laughed.</p><p>\"What's that supposed to mean?\"I asked, offended.</p><p>\"Have you looked at yourself in a mirror lately?\"the boy said.</p><p>I glanced down at my dusty suit and knew why they were laughing: I looked like something out of Beetlejuice.</p><p>\"I lost the bag with my normal clothes,\"I lied. \"These are all I have. I'm getting new stuff soon.\"</p><p>\"You should.\"The boy smiled, then asked if I played hockey. When I said yes, he invited me to play with them.</p><p>\"You can be on my team,\"he said, handing me a spare stick. \"We're down, six-two. My name's Michael.\"</p><p>\"Hey. I'm Darren,\"I replied, testing the stick.</p><p>I rolled up the cuffs of my pants and made sure my shoelaces were double-tied. While I was doing that, the other team scored another goal. Michael swore loudly and dragged the ball back to the center.</p><p>\"You ready to go?\"he asked me.</p><p>\"Sure.\"</p><p>\"Come on, then,\"he said. He tapped the ball to me and moved ahead, waiting for me to pass back.</p><p>It had been a long time since I'd played hockey - at school, in gym, we'd usually had to choose between hockey and soccer, and I never passed up a chance for a game of soccer - but with the stick in my hands and the ball at my feet, it seemed like only yesterday since I'd played hockey.</p><p>I knocked the ball from left to right a few times, making sure I hadn't forgotten how to control it, then looked up and focused on the goal.</p><p>There were seven players between me and the goalie. None of them rushed to stop me. I guess they felt they didn't need to since they were five goals ahead.</p><p>I started running. A big kid - the other team's captain - tried blocking me, but I slipped around him easily. I was past another two before they could react, then dribbled around a fourth. The fifth player slid in with his stick at knee level, but I jumped over him with ease, faked the sixth, and shot before the seventh and final defender could get in the way.</p><p>Even though I hit the ball pretty softly, it went a lot harder than the goalie was expecting and flew into the top right-hand corner of the goal. It bounced off the wall and I caught it in the air.</p><p>I turned, smiling, and looked back at my teammates. They were still back near the other goal, staring at me in shock. I carried the ball back to the center line and set it down without saying a word. Then I turned to Michael and said, \"Seven-three.\"</p><p>He blinked slowly, then smiled. \"Oh, yeah!\"he cheered softly, then high-fived his teammates. \"I think we're going to enjoy this!\"</p><p>I had a great time for a while, dominating play, rushing back to defend, picking players out with pinpoint passes. I scored a couple of goals and set up four more. We were leading 9-7 and coasting. The other team hated it. They made us give them two of our best players, but it made no difference. I could have given them everybody except our goalie and still kicked their butts.</p><p>Then things got nasty. The captain of the other team - Danny - had been trying to foul me for a while, but I was too quick for him and easily dodged his raised stick and stuck-out legs. But then he began to punch my ribs and stand on my toes and slam his elbows into my arms. None of it hurt me, but it annoyed me. I hate sore losers.</p><p>The last straw came when Danny pinched me in a very painful place! Even vampires have their limits. I yelled out and bent over, wincing from the pain.</p><p>Danny laughed and took off with the ball.</p><p>I got up after a few seconds, mad as hell. Danny was halfway down the rink. I sprinted after him. I knocked the players between us aside - it didn't matter if they were on his team or mine - then caught up behind him and swiped at his legs with my stick. It would have been a dangerous tackle if it had come from a human. Coming from a half-vampire...</p><p>There was a sharp snapping sound. Danny screamed and went down. Play stopped immediately. Everybody in the game knew the difference between a yell of pain and a scream of real agony.</p><p>I scrambled to my feet, already sorry for what I'd done, wishing I could take it back. I looked at my stick, hoping to find it broken in two, hoping that had been what made the snapping noise. But it wasn't.</p><p>I'd broken both of Danny's shinbones.</p><p>His lower legs were bent awkwardly and the skin around the shins was torn. I could see the white of bone in among the red.</p><p>Michael bent over to examine Danny's legs. When he got up, there was a horrified look in his eyes.</p><p>\"You've cracked his legs wide open!\"he gasped.</p><p>\"I didn't mean to,\"I cried. \"He squeezed my...\"I pointed to the spot beneath my waist.</p><p>\"You broke his legs!\"Michael shouted, then backed away from me. Everyone around him backed away as well.</p><p>They were afraid of me.</p><p>Breathing hard, I dropped my stick and left, knowing I'd make matters worse if I stayed and waited for grown-ups to arrive. None of the guys tried to stop me. They were too scared. They were terrified of me... Darren Shan... a monster.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>It was dark when I got back. Mr. Crepsley was awake. I told him we should leave town right away, but didn't tell him why. He took one look at my face, nodded, and started gathering our stuff.</p>","<p>\"We didn't say much that night. I was thinking how much it stunk to be a half-vampire. Mr. Crepsley could tell there was something wrong with me, but didn't bother me with questions. It wasn't the first time I'd been grouchy. He was getting used to my mood swings.</p><p>We found an abandoned church to sleep in. Mr. Crepsley lay out on a long pew, while I made a bed for myself on a pile of moss and weeds on the floor.</p><p>I woke early and spent the day exploring the church and the small cemetery outside. The headstones were old and a lot of them were cracked or covered with weeds. I spent a few hours cleaning some, pulling weeds away and washing the stones with water I got from a nearby stream. It kept my mind off the hockey game.</p><p>A family of rabbits lived in a nearby burrow. As the day went by, they crept closer to see what I was up to. They were curious little guys, especially the young ones. At one point, I pretended to be asleep and a couple edged closer and closer, until they were only a few feet away.</p><p>When they were as close as they would probably come, I leaped up and shouted, \"Boo!\"and they went running away like wildfire. One fell head over heels and rolled away down the mouth of the burrow.</p><p>That totally cheered me up.</p><p>I found a grocery store in the afternoon and bought some meat and vegetables. I made a fire when I got back to the church, then grabbed the pots and pans bag from underneath Mr. Crepsley's pew. I looked through the contents until I found what I was looking for. It was a small pot. I carefully laid it upside down on the floor, then pressed the metal bulge on the top.</p><p>The pot mushroomed out in size, as folded-in panels opened up. Within five seconds it had become a full-sized pot, which I filled with water and stuck on the fire.</p><p>All the pots and pans in the bag were like this. Mr.</p><p>Crepsley got them from a woman called Evanna a long time ago. They weighed the same as ordinary cook-ware, but because they could fold up small, they were easier to carry around.</p><p>I made a stew like Mr. Crepsley had taught me. He thought everybody should know how to cook.</p><p>I took leftover pieces of the carrots and cabbage outside and dropped them by the rabbit burrow.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley was surprised to find dinner - which was breakfast from his point of view - waiting for him when he awoke. He sniffed the fumes from the bubbling pot and licked his lips.</p><p>\"I could get used to this.\"He smiled, then yawned, stretched, and ran a hand through the short crop of orange hair on his head. Then he scratched the long scar running down the left side of his face. It was a familiar routine of his.</p><p>I'd always wanted to ask how he got his scar, but I never had. One night, when I was feeling brave, I would.</p><p>There were no tables, so we ate off our laps. I got two of the folded-up plates out of the bag, popped them open, and grabbed knives and forks. I served the food and we ate.</p><p>Toward the end, Mr. Crepsley wiped around his mouth with a white napkin and coughed awkwardly.</p><p>\"The stew is very nice,\"he complimented me.</p><p>\"Thank you,\"I replied.</p><p>\"I... um... that is...\"He sighed. \"I never was very good at being subtle,\"he said, \"so I will come right out and say it: What went wrong yesterday? Why were you so upset?\"</p><p>I stared at my almost empty plate, not sure if I wanted to answer or not. Then, all of a sudden, I blurted out the whole story. I hardly took a breath between the start and the finish.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley listened carefully. When I was done, he thought about it for a minute or two before speaking.</p><p>\"It is something you must get used to,\"he said. \"It is a fact of life that we are stronger than humans, faster and tougher. If you play with them, they will be hurt.\"</p><p>\"I didn't mean to hurt him,\"I said. \"It was an accident.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley shrugged. \"Listen, Darren, there is no way you can stop this from happening again, not if you interact with humans. No matter how hard you try to be normal, you are not. There will always be accidents waiting to happen.\"</p><p>\"What you're saying is, I can't have friends anymore, right?\"I nodded sadly. \"I'd figured that out by myself. That's why I was so sad. I was getting used to the idea of never being able to go back home to see my old friends, but it was just yesterday that I realized I'd never be able to make new ones, either. I'm stuck with you. I can't have any other friends, can I?\"</p><p>He rubbed his scar and pursed his lips. \"That is not true,\"he said. \"You can have friends. You just have to be careful. You -\"</p><p>\"That's not good enough!\"I cried. \"You said it yourself; there will always be an accident waiting to happen. Even shaking hands is dangerous. I could cut their wrists open with my nails!\"</p><p>I shook my head slowly. \"No,\"I said firmly. \"I won't put people's lives in danger. I'm too dangerous to have friends anymore. Besides, it's not like I can make a true friend.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\"he asked.</p><p>\"True friends don't keep secrets from one another. I could never tell a human that I was a vampire. I'd always have to lie and pretend to be someone I'm not. I'd always be afraid he'd find out what I was and hate me.\"</p><p>\"It is a problem every vampire shares,\"Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>\"But every vampire isn't a child!\"I shouted. \"What age were you when you were changed? Were you a man?\"He nodded. \"Friends aren't that important to adults. My dad told me that grown-ups get used to not having a lot of friends. They have work and hobbies and other stuff to keep them busy. But my friends were the most important thing in my life, besides my family. Well, you took my family away when you pumped your stinking blood into me. Now you've ruined the chances of my ever having a real friend again.</p><p>\"Thanks a lot,\"I said angrily. \"Thanks for making a monster out of me and wrecking my life.\"</p><p>I was close to tears, but didn't want to cry, not in front of him. So I stabbed the last piece of meat on my plate with my fork and rammed it into my mouth, then I chewed on it fiercely.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley was quiet after my outburst. I couldn't tell if he was angry or sorry. For a while I thought I'd said too much. What if he turned around and said, \"If that's the way you feel, I will leave you\"? What would I do then?</p><p>I was thinking of apologizing when he spoke in a soft voice and surprised me.</p><p>\"I am sorry,\"he said. \"I should not have blooded you. It was a poor call. You were too young. It has been so long since I was a boy, I had forgotten what it was like. I never thought of your friends and how much you would miss them. It was wrong of me to blood you. Terribly wrong. I...\"</p><p>He trailed off into silence. He looked so miserable, I almost felt sorry for him. Then I remembered what he'd done to me and I hated him again. Then I saw wet drops at the corners of his eyes that might have been tears, and I felt sorry for him again.</p><p>I was really confused.</p><p>\"Well, there's no use crying about it,\"I finally said. \"We can't go back. What's done is done, right?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"He sighed. \"If I could, I would take back my terrible gift. But that is not possible. Vampirism is forever. Once somebody has been changed, there is no changing back.</p><p>\"Still,\"he said, mulling it over, \"it is not as bad as you think. Perhaps...\"His eyes narrowed thoughtfully.</p><p>\"Perhaps what?\"I asked.</p><p>\"We can find friends for you,\"he said. \"You do not have to be stuck with me all the time.\"</p><p>\"I don't understand.\"I frowned. \"Didn't we just agree it wasn't safe for me to be around humans?\"</p><p>\"I am not talking about humans,\"he said, starting to smile. \"I am talking about people with special powers. People like us. People you can tell your secrets to...\"</p><p>He leaned across and took my hands in his.</p><p>\"Darren,\"he said, \"what do you think about going back and becoming a member of the Cirque Du Freak?\"</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>The more we discussed the idea, the more I liked it. Mr. Crepsley said the Cirque performers would know what I was and would accept me as one of their own. The lineup of the show changed a lot and there was almost always someone who would be around my own age. I could hang out with them.</p><p>\"What if I don't like it there?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Then we leave,\"he said. \"I enjoyed traveling with the Cirque, but I am not crazy about it. If you like it, we stay. If you do not, we hit the road again.\"</p><p>\"They won't mind me tagging along?\"I asked.</p><p>\"You will have to pull your weight,\"he replied. \"Mr. Tall insists on everybody doing something. You will have to help set up chairs and lights, sell souvenirs, clean up afterward, or do the cooking. You will be kept busy, but they will not overwork you. We will have plenty of time for our lessons.\"</p><p>We decided to give it a shot. At least it would mean a real bed every night. My back was stiff from sleeping on floors.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley had to find out where the show was before we could join. I asked him how he was going to do that. He told me he was able to home in on Mr. Tall's thoughts.</p><p>\"You mean he's telepathic?\"I asked, remembering what Steve had called people who could talk to each other using only their brains.</p><p>\"Sort of,\"Mr. Crepsley said. \"We cannot speak to each other with our thoughts but I can pick up his... aura, you could call it. Once I locate that, tracking him down will be no problem.\"</p><p>\"Could I locate his aura?\"I wanted to know.</p><p>\"No,\"Mr. Crepsley said. \"Most vampires - along with a few gifted humans - can, but half-vampires cannot.\"</p><p>He sat down in the middle of the church and closed his eyes. He was quiet for about a minute. Then his eyelids opened and he stood.</p><p>\"Got him,\"he said.</p><p>\"So soon?\"I asked. \"I thought it would take longer.\"</p><p>\"I have searched for his aura many times,\"Mr. Crepsley explained. \"I know what to look for. Finding him is as easy as finding a needle in a haystack.\"</p><p>\"That's supposed to be hard, isn't it?\"</p><p>\"Not for a vampire,\"he said.</p><p>While we were packing to leave, I found myself gazing around the church. Something had been bothering me, but I wasn't sure whether I should mention it to Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>\"Go on,\"he said, startling me. \"Ask whatever it is that is on your mind.\"</p><p>\"How did you know I wanted to ask something?\"I said, sort of freaked out.</p><p>He laughed. \"It does not take a vampire to know when a child is curious. You have been bursting with a question for ages. What is it?\"</p><p>I took a deep breath. \"Do you believe in God?\"I asked.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley looked at me oddly, then nodded slowly. \"I believe in the gods of the vampires.\"</p><p>I frowned. \"There are vampire gods?\"</p><p>\"Of course,\"he said. \"Every culture has gods: Egyptian gods, Indian gods, Chinese gods. Vampires are no different.\"</p><p>\"What about heaven?\"I asked.</p><p>\"We believe in Paradise. It lies beyond the stars. When we die, if we have lived good lives, our spirits float free of the earth, cross the stars and galaxies, and come at last to a wonderful world at the other side of the universe - Paradise.\"</p><p>\"And if they don't live good lives?\"</p><p>\"They stay here,\"he said. \"They remain bound to earth as ghosts, doomed to wander the face of this planet forever.\"</p><p>I thought about that. \"What's a 'good life' for a vampire?\"I asked. \"How do they make it to Paradise?\"</p><p>\"Live cleanly,\"he said. \"Do not kill unless necessary. Do not hurt people. Do not spoil the world.\"</p><p>\"Drinking blood isn't evil?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Not unless you kill the person you drink from,\"Mr. Crepsley said. \"And even then, sometimes, it can be a good thing.\"</p><p>\"Killing someone can be good?\"I gasped.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley nodded seriously. \"People have souls, Darren. When they die, those souls go to heaven or Paradise. But it is possible to keep a part of them here. When we drink small amounts of blood, we do not take any of a person's essence. But if we drink lots, we keep part of them alive within us.\"</p><p>\"How?\"I asked, frowning.</p><p>\"By draining a person's blood, we absorb some of that person's memories and feelings,\"he said. \"They become part of us, and we can see the world the way they saw it and remember things which might otherwise have been forgotten.\"</p><p>\"Like what?\"</p><p>He thought a moment. \"One of my dearest friends is called Paris Skyle,\"he said. \"He is very old. Many centuries ago, he was friends with William Shakespeare.\"</p><p>\"The William Shakespeare - the guy who wrote the plays?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley nodded. \"Plays and poems. But not all of Shakespeare's poetry was recorded; some of his most famous verses were lost. When Shakespeare was dying, Paris drank from him - Shakespeare asked him to - and was able to tap into those lost poems and have them written down. The world would have been a poorer place without them.\"</p><p>\"But...\"I stopped. \"Do you only do that with people who ask, and who are dying?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\"he said. \"It would be evil to kill a healthy person. But to drink from friends who are close to death, and keep their memories and experiences alive...\"He smiled. \"That is very good indeed.</p><p>\"Come,\"he said then. \"Brood about it on the way. We must be off.\"</p><p>I jumped on Mr. Crepsley's back when we were ready to leave, and off we flitted. He still hadn't explained how he could move so fast. It wasn't that he ran quickly; it was more like the world slipped by as he ran. He said all full vampires could flit.</p><p>It was nice, watching the countryside drift away behind us. We ran up hills and across the vast plains, faster than the wind. There was total silence while we were flitting and nobody ever noticed us. It was like we were surrounded by a magic bubble.</p>","<p>While we flitted I thought about what Mr. Crepsley had said, about keeping people's memories alive by drinking from them. I wasn't sure how that would work, and I made up my mind to ask him about it sometime later.</p><p>Flitting was hard work; the vampire was sweating and I could see him starting to struggle. To help, I took out a bottle of human blood, uncorked it, and held it to his lips so he could drink.</p><p>He nodded his silent thanks, wiped the sweat from his brow, and kept going.</p><p>Finally, as the sky was beginning to lighten, he slowed to a halt. I climbed down off his back and looked around. We were in the middle of a country road, fields and trees all around us, with no houses in sight.</p><p>\"Where's the Cirque Du Freak?\"I asked.</p><p>\"A few miles farther ahead,\"he said, pointing. He was kneeling down, panting for breath.</p><p>\"Did you run out of steam?\"I asked, holding back my laughter.</p><p>\"No.\"He glared. \"I could have made it, but did not want to arrive looking flushed.\"</p><p>\"You'd better not rest too long,\"I warned him. \"Morning's on its way.\"</p><p>\"I know precisely what time it is!\"he snapped. \"I know more about mornings and dawns than any living human. We have plenty of time on our side. A whole forty-three minutes yet.\"</p><p>\"If you say so.\"</p><p>\"I do.\"He stood, annoyed, and began to walk. I waited until he was a little in front, then ran ahead of him.</p><p>\"Hurry up, old man,\"I teased. \"You're getting left behind.\"</p><p>\"Keep it up,\"he growled. \"See what it gets you. A smack on the ear and a kick in the pants.\"</p><p>He started running after a couple of minutes, and the two of us jogged along, side by side. I was in a good mood, happier than I'd been for months. It was nice having something to look forward to.</p><p>We passed a bunch of grungy campers on our way.</p><p>They were starting to wake up and move around. A couple waved to us. They were funny-looking people: long hair, strange clothes, weighed down with fancy earrings and bracelets.</p><p>There were banners and flags all over the camp. I tried reading them, but it was hard to focus while I was jogging, and I didn't want to stop. From what I could tell, the campers had something to do with a protest against a new road.</p><p>The road was really curvy. After the fifth turn, we finally spotted the Cirque Du Freak, nestled in a clearing by the banks of a river. It was quiet - everyone was sleeping, I imagined - and if we'd been in a car and not looking for the vans and tents, it would have been easy to miss.</p><p>It was a weird place for the circus to be. There was no hall or big tent for the freaks to perform in. I figured this must be a pit stop between two towns.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley weaved between the vans and cars with confidence. He knew exactly where he was going. I followed, less sure of myself, remembering the night I crept past the freaks and stole Madam Octa.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley stopped at a long silver van and knocked on the door. It opened almost immediately and the towering figure of Mr. Tall appeared. His eyes looked darker than ever in the dim light. If I hadn't known better, I would have sworn he had no eyeballs, only two black, empty spaces.</p><p>\"Oh, it's you,\"he said, voice low, lips hardly moving. \"I thought I felt you searching for me.\"He craned over Mr. Crepsley and looked down to where I was shaking. \"I see you've brought the boy.\"</p><p>\"May we come in?\"Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"Of course. \"What is it one is supposed to say to you vampires?\"He smiled. \"Enter of your own free will?\"</p><p>\"Something like that,\"Mr. Crepsley replied, and from the smile on his face, I knew it was an old joke between them.</p><p>We went in the van and sat down. It was pretty bare inside, just a few shelves with posters and pamphlets for the Cirque, the tall red hat and gloves I'd seen Mr. Tall wear before, a couple of knickknacks, and a hideaway bed.</p><p>\"I didn't expect you back so soon, Larten,\"Mr. Tall said. Even when he was sitting down he looked enormous.</p><p>\"A swift return had not been on the agenda, Hibernius.\"</p><p>Hibernius? That was a weird name. Still, it fit him somehow. Hibernius Tall. It had a strange ring to it.</p><p>\"Did you run into trouble?\"Mr. Tall asked.</p><p>\"No,\"Mr. Crepsley said. \"Darren was not happy. I decided he would be better off here, among those of his own kind.\"</p><p>\"I see.\"Mr. Tall studied me curiously. \"You have come a long way since I saw you last, Darren Shan,\"he said.</p><p>\"I liked it better where I was,\"I grumbled.</p><p>\"Then why did you leave?\"he asked.</p><p>I glared at him. \"You know why,\"I said coldly.</p><p>He nodded slowly.</p><p>\"Is it okay if we stay?\"Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"Of course,\"Mr. Tall replied immediately. \"Delighted to have you back, actually. We're a bit understaffed at the moment. Alexander Ribs, Sive and Seersa, and Gertha Teeth are off on vacations or business. Cormac Limbs is on his way to join Us but is late getting here. Larten Crepsley and his amazing performing spider will be an invaluable addition to the lineup.\"</p><p>\"Thank you,\"Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>\"What about me?\"I asked boldly.</p><p>Mr. Tall smiled. \"You are less valuable,\"he said, \"but welcome all the same.\"</p><p>I snorted but said nothing.</p><p>\"Where shall we be playing?\"Mr. Crepsley asked next.</p><p>\"Right here,\"Mr. Tall told him.</p><p>\"Here?\"I piped up in surprise.</p><p>\"That puzzles you?\"Mr. Tall enquired.</p><p>\"It's in the middle of nowhere,\"I said. \"I thought you only played in towns and cities, where you'd get big audiences.\"</p><p>\"We always get a big audience,\"Mr. Tall said. \"No matter where we play, people will come. Usually we stick to more populated areas, but this is a slow time of the year for us. As I've said, several of our best performers are absent, as are... certain other members of our company.\"</p><p>A strange, secretive look passed between Mr. Tall and Mr. Crepsley, and I felt I was being left out of something.</p><p>\"So we are resting for a while,\"Mr. Tall went on. \"We shall not be putting on any shows for a few days. We're relaxing.\"</p><p>\"We passed a camp on our way,\"Mr. Crepsley said. \"Are they causing any problems?\"</p><p>\"The foot soldiers of NOP?\"Mr. Tall laughed. \"They're too busy defending trees and rocks to interfere with us.\"</p><p>\"What's NOP?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Nature's Opposing Protectors,\"Mr. Tall explained. \"They're ecowarriors. They run around the country trying to stop new roads and bridges from being built. They've been here a couple of months but are due to move on soon.\"</p><p>\"Are they real warriors?\"I asked. \"Do they have guns and grenades and tanks?\"</p><p>The two adults almost laughed their heads off.</p><p>\"He can be quite silly sometimes,\"Mr. Crepsley said between fits of laughter, \"but he is not as dumb as he seems.\"</p><p>I felt my face reddening but held my tongue. I knew from experience that it was no use getting mad at grown-ups when they laugh at you; it only makes them laugh even harder.</p><p>\"They call themselves warriors,\"Mr. Tall said, \"but they're not really. They chain themselves to trees and pour sand into the engines of backhoes and toss nails in the paths of cars. That sort of thing.\"</p><p>\"Why -\"I started, but Mr. Crepsley interrupted.</p><p>\"We do not have time for questions,\"he said. \"A few more minutes and the sun will be up.\"He rose and shook Mr. Tall's hand. \"Thank you for taking us back, Hibernius.\"</p><p>\"My pleasure,\"Mr. Tall replied.</p><p>\"I trust you took good care of my coffin?\"</p><p>\"Of course.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley smiled happily and rubbed his hands together. \"That is what I miss most when I am away. It will be nice to sleep in it once more.\"</p><p>\"What about the boy?\"Mr. Tall asked. \"Do you want us to knock together a coffin for him?\"</p><p>\"Don't even think about it!\"I shouted. \"You won't get me in one of those again!\"I remembered what it felt like to be in a coffin - when I was buried alive - and shivered.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley smiled. \"Put Darren in with one of the other performers,\"he said. \"Somebody his own age, if possible.\"</p><p>Mr. Tall thought a moment. \"How about Evra?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley's smile spread. \"Yes. I think putting him in with Evra is a marvelous idea.\"</p><p>\"Who's Evra?\"I asked nervously.</p><p>\"You will find out,\"Mr. Crepsley promised, opening the door to the van. \"I will leave you to Mr. Tall. He will take care of you. I have to be away.\"</p><p>And then he was gone, off to find his beloved coffin.</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder and saw Mr. Tall standing directly behind me. I don't know how he crossed the room so quickly. I didn't even hear him moving to stand up.</p><p>\"Shall we go?\"he said.</p><p>I gulped and nodded.</p><p>He led the way through the campsite. The morning was breaking and I saw a couple of lights coming on in a few of the vans and tents. Mr. Tall led me to an old gray tent, big enough for five or six people.</p><p>\"Here are some blankets,\"he said, handing over a bunch of woolly sheets. \"And a pillow.\"I didn't know where he got them from - he didn't have them when we left the van - but was too tired to ask. \"You may sleep as late as you wish. I will come for you when you are awake and explain your duties. Evra will take care of you until then.\"</p><p>I lifted the flap of the tent and looked inside. It was too dark to see anything. \"Who's Evra?\"I asked, turning back to Mr. Tall. But he was gone, having disappeared with his usual quick, silent speed.</p><p>I sighed and entered, clutching the blankets to my chest. I let the flap fall back into place, then stood quietly inside, waiting for my eyes to adjust. I could hear someone breathing softly and could make out a vague shape in a hammock in the darkness beyond the middle of the tent. I looked for somewhere to make my bed. I didn't want my tentmate tripping over me when he was getting up.</p><p>I walked forward a few blind steps. Suddenly something slithered toward me through the darkness.</p><p>I stopped and stared ahead, wishing so badly that I could see (without the light of the stars or moon, even a vampire struggles to make things out).</p><p>\"Hello?\"I whispered. \"Are you Evra? I'm Darren Shan. I'm your new -\"</p><p>I stopped. The slithering noise had reached my feet. As I stood rooted to the spot, something fleshy and slimy wrapped itself around my legs. I instantly knew what it was but didn't dare look down until it had climbed more than halfway up my body. Finally, as its coils curled around my chest, I worked up the courage to look down and stare into the eyes of a long, thick, hissing... snake!</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>I stood frozen with fear for more than an hour, staring into the snake's deathly cold eyes, waiting for it to strike.</p><p>Finally, with the light of the strong morning sun shining through the canvas of the tent, the sleeping shape in the hammock shifted, yawned, sat up, and glanced around.</p><p>It was the snake-boy, and he looked shocked when he saw me. He immediately rocked back in the hammock and raised the covers, as though to protect himself. Then he saw the snake wrapped around me and breathed easily.</p><p>\"Who are you?\"he asked sharply. \"What are you doing here?\"</p><p>I shook my head slowly. I didn't dare speak for fear that the movement of my lungs would cause the snake to strike.</p><p>\"You'd better answer,\"he warned, \"or I'll tell her to take your eyes out.\"</p><p>\"I... I... I'm Duh-Darren Sh-sh-Shan,\"I stuttered. \"Mr. Tuh-Tall told me to cuh-come in. He said I wuh-wuh-was supposed to be your new ruh-ruh-ruh-roommate.\"</p><p>\"Darren Shan?\"The snake-boy frowned, then pointed knowingly. \"You're Mr. Crepsley's assistant, aren't you?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\"I said quietly.</p><p>The snake-boy grinned. \"Did he know Mr. Tall was putting you in with me?\"I nodded and he laughed. \"I've never met a vampire without a nasty sense of humor.\"</p><p>He swung down out of the hammock, crossed the tent, took hold of the snake's head, and began unwrapping it. \"You're okay,\"he assured me. \"In fact, you were never in danger. The snake's been asleep the whole time. You could have tugged her off and she wouldn't have stirred. She's a deep sleeper.\"</p><p>\"She's asleep ?\"I squeaked. \"But... how come she wrapped herself around me?\"</p><p>He smiled. \"She sleepcrawls.\"</p><p>\"Sleepcrawls !\"I stared at him, then at the snake, which hadn't moved while he was unwinding her. The last of her coils came free and I could step away to one side. My legs were stiff and full of pins and needles.</p><p>\"A sleepcrawling snake.\"I laughed uneasily. \"Thank God she's not a sleepeating snake!\"</p><p>The snake-boy tucked his pet away in a corner and stroked her head lovingly. \"She wouldn't have eaten you even if she had woken up,\"he informed me. \"She ate a goat yesterday. Snakes her size don't have to eat very often.\"</p><p>Leaving his snake, he threw back the tent flap and stepped out. I followed quickly, not wanting to be left alone with the reptile.</p><p>I studied him closely outside. He was exactly as I remembered: a few years older than me and very thin, with long yellow-green hair, narrow eyes, and strangely webbed fingers and toes; his body was covered in green, gold, yellow, and blue scales. He was wearing a pair of shorts and nothing else.</p><p>\"By the way,\"he said, \"my name's Evra Von.\"He held out a hand and we shook. His palm felt slippery, but dry. A few of the scales came off and stuck to my hand when I pulled it away. They were like scraps of colored dead skin.</p>","<p>\"Evra Von what?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Just plain Von,\"he said, rubbing his stomach. \"You hungry?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\"I said, and went with Evra to get something to eat.</p><p>The camp was alive with activity. Since there had been no show the night before, most of the freaks and their helpers had gone to bed early, and so now they were up and about earlier than usual.</p><p>I was fascinated by the hustle and bustle. I hadn't realized there were so many people working for the Cirque. I'd thought it would just be the performers and assistants I'd seen the night I went to the show with Steve, but as I looked around I saw that those were just the tip of the iceberg. There were at least two dozen people walking or talking, washing or cooking, none of whom I'd seen before.</p><p>\"Who are all these?\"I asked.</p><p>\"The backbone of the Cirque Du Freak,\"Evra replied. \"They do the driving, set up the tents, do the laundry and the cooking, fix our costumes, clean up after shows. It's a big operation.\"</p><p>\"Are they normal humans?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Most of them,\"he said.</p><p>\"How did they come to work here?\"</p><p>\"Some are related to the performers. Some are friends of Mr. Tall. Some just wandered in, liked what they saw, and stayed.\"</p><p>\"People can do that?\"I asked.</p><p>\"If Mr. Tall likes the look of them,\"Evra said. \"There are always openings at the Cirque Du Freak.\"</p><p>Evra stopped at a large campfire, and I stopped beside him. Hans Hands (a man who could walk on his hands and run faster on them than the world's fastest sprinter) was resting on a log, while Truska (the bearded lady, who grew her beard whenever she wanted) cooked sausages on a wooden stick. Several humans were sitting or lying around.</p><p>\"Good morning, Evra Von,\"Hans Hands said.</p><p>\"How are you, Hans?\"Evra replied.</p><p>\"Who's your young friend?\"Hans asked, eyeing me suspiciously.</p><p>\"This is Darren Shan,\"Evra said.</p><p>\"The Darren Shan?\"Hans asked, eyebrows raising.</p><p>\"None other.\"Evra grinned.</p><p>\"What do you mean, The Darren Shan'?\"I asked.</p><p>\"You're famous in these parts,\"Hans said.</p><p>\"Why? Because I'm a\"- I lowered my voice - \"half-vampire?\"</p><p>Hans laughed pleasantly. \"Half-vampires are nothing new. If I had a silver dollar for every half-vampire I'd seen, I'd have...\"He scrunched up his face and thought. \"Twenty-nine silver dollars. But young half-vampires are a different story. I never saw or heard of a guy your age living it up among the ranks of the walking dead. Tell me: Have the Vampire Generals been around to inspect you yet?\"</p><p>\"Who are the Vampire Generals?\"I asked.</p><p>\"They're -\"</p><p>\"Hans!\"a lady washing clothes barked. He stopped speaking and looked around guiltily. \"Do you think Larten would enjoy hearing you spreading tales?\"she snapped.</p><p>Hans made a face. \"Sorry,\"he said. \"It's the morning air. I'm not used to it. It makes me say things I shouldn't.\"</p><p>I wanted him to explain about the Vampire Generals, but I guess it would have been impolite to ask.</p><p>Truska checked the sausages, pulled a couple off the stick, and handed them out. She smiled when she came to me, and said something in a strange, foreign language.</p><p>Evra laughed. \"She wants to know if you like sausages or if you're a vegetarian.\"</p><p>\"That's a good one!\"Hans chuckled. \"A vampire vegetarian!\"</p><p>\"You speak her language?\"I asked Evra.</p><p>\"Yes,\"he said proudly. \"I'm still learning - it's the hardest language I've ever tried to learn - but I'm the only one in the camp who knows what she's saying. I'm excellent at languages,\"he bragged.</p><p>\"What language is it?\"I asked.</p><p>\"I don't know,\"he said, frowning. \"She won't tell me.\"</p><p>That sounded weird, but I didn't want to say anything to offend him. Instead, I took one of the sausages and smiled thanks. I bit into it and had to drop it immediately; it was piping hot! Evra laughed and handed me a glass of water. I drank until my mouth was back to normal, then blew on the sausage to cool it down.</p><p>We sat with Hans and Truska and the others for a while, chatting and eating and soaking up the morning sun. The grass was wet with dew, but none of us minded. Evra introduced me to everyone in the group. There were too many names for me to remember at once, so I just smiled and shook hands.</p><p>Mr. Tall soon appeared. One minute he wasn't there, the next he was standing behind Evra, warming his hands over the fire.</p><p>\"You're up early, Master Shan,\"Mr. Tall remarked.</p><p>\"I couldn't sleep,\"I told him. \"I was too - \"I looked over at Evra and smiled \"- wound-up.\"</p><p>\"I hope it will not affect your ability to work,\"Mr. Tall said.</p><p>\"I'll be fine,\"I said. \"I'm ready to work.\"</p><p>\"You're sure?\"</p><p>\"I'm sure.\"</p><p>\"That's what I like to hear.\"He pulled out a large notebook and flipped through the pages. \"Let's see what we can find for you to do today,\"he said. \"Tell me: Are you a good cook?\"</p><p>\"I can cook stew. Mr. Crepsley taught me.\"</p><p>\"Have you ever cooked for thirty or forty humans?\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"Too bad. Maybe you'll learn.\"He flipped through another couple of pages. \"Can you sew?\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"Have you washed clothes before?\"</p><p>\"By hand?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"Hmmm.\"He flipped some more, then snapped the book shut. \"Okay,\"he said, \"until we find a more permanent position for you, stick with Evra and help him with his chores. Does that sound fair?\"</p><p>\"I'd like that,\"I said.</p><p>\"You don't mind, Evra?\"he asked the snake-boy.</p><p>\"Not at all,\"Evra replied.</p><p>\"Very well. It's settled. Evra will be in charge of you until further notice. Do what he says. When your colleague-in-blood arises,\"- he meant Mr. Crepsley - \"you're free to spend the night with him if he so desires. We'll see how you do, then make a decision on how best to utilize your talents.\"</p><p>\"Thank you,\"I said.</p><p>\"My pleasure,\"he replied.</p><p>I expected him to suddenly vanish then, but instead he turned and walked away slowly, whistling, enjoying the sunshine.</p><p>\"Well, Darren,\"Evra said, sticking a scaly arm around my shoulders, \"looks like you and I are partners now. How do you feel about that?\"</p><p>\"I feel good... partner.\"</p><p>\"Cool!\"He slapped my shoulder and gulped down the last of his sausage. \"Then let's get going.\"</p><p>\"What do we do first?\"I asked.</p><p>\"What we'll be doing first every morning,\"Evra said. \"Milking the poison from the fangs of my snake.\"</p><p>\"Oh,\"I said. \"Is it dangerous?\"</p><p>\"Only if she bites before we finish,\"Evra said, then laughed at my expression and pushed me ahead of him to the tent.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>Evra did the milking himself - to my great relief - then we brought the snake outside and laid her on the grass. We grabbed buckets of water and scrubbed her down with really soft sponges.</p><p>After that, we had to feed the wolf-man. His cage was near the back of the campsite. He roared when he saw us coming. He looked as angry and dangerous as he had that night I went to see the Cirque with Steve. He shook the bars and lunged at us if we got too close - which we didn't!</p><p>\"Why is he so vicious?\"I asked, tossing him a large chunk of raw meat, which he grabbed in midair and bit into.</p><p>\"Because he's a real wolf-man,\"Evra said. \"He's not just somebody very hairy. He's half human, half wolf.\"</p><p>\"Isn't it cruel to keep him chained up?\"I asked, throwing him another slice of meat.</p><p>\"If we didn't, he'd run free and kill people. The mix of human and wolf blood has driven him mad. He wouldn't just kill when he was hungry; if he was free, he'd murder all the time.\"</p><p>\"Isn't there a cure?\"I asked, feeling sorry for him.</p><p>\"There isn't a cure because it isn't a disease,\"Evra explained. \"This isn't something he caught, it's how he was born. This is what he is.\"</p><p>\"How did it happen?\"I asked.</p><p>Evra looked at me seriously. \"Do you really want to know?\"</p><p>I stared at the hairy monster in the cage, ripping up the meat as if it were cotton candy, then gulped and said, \"No, I suppose I don't.\"</p><p>We did a bunch of jobs after that. We peeled potatoes for the night's dinner, helped repair a tire on one of the cars, spent an hour painting the roof of a van, and walked a dog. Evra said most days were like this, just wandering through the camp, seeing what needed doing, helping out here and there.</p><p>In the evening we took a garbage bag full of cans and broken pieces of glass to the tent of Rhamus Twobellies, a huge man who could eat anything. I wanted to stay and watch him eat, but Evra hurried me out. Rhamus didn't like people watching him eat when he wasn't performing.</p><p>We had a lot of time to ourselves, and during our quieter moments we told each other about our lives - where we'd come from and how we'd grown up.</p><p>Evra had been born to ordinary parents. They were horrified when they saw him. They abandoned him at an orphanage, where he stayed until an evil circus owner bought him at the age of four.</p><p>\"Those were bad days,\"he said quietly. \"He used to beat me and treat me like a real snake. He kept me locked up in a glass case and let people pay to look at me and laugh.\"</p><p>He was with the circus for seven long, miserable years, touring small towns, being made to feel ugly and freakish and useless.</p><p>Finally, Mr. Tall came to the rescue.</p><p>\"He showed up one night,\"Evra said. \"He appeared suddenly out of the darkness and stood by my cage for a long time, watching me. He didn't say a word. Neither did I.</p><p>\"The circus owner came. He didn't know who Mr. Tall was, but thought he might be a rich man, interested in buying me. He gave him his price and stood back, waiting for an answer.</p><p>\"Mr. Tall didn't say anything for a few minutes. Then his left hand grabbed the circus owner by the neck. He squeezed once and that was the end of him. He fell to the floor, dead. Mr. Tall opened the door to my cage and said, 'Let's go, Evra. I think Mr. Tali's able to read minds, which is how he knew my name.\"</p><p>Evra was quiet after that. He had a faraway look in his eyes.</p><p>\"Do you want to see something amazing?\"he finally said, snapping out of his thoughtful mood.</p><p>\"Sure,\"I said.</p><p>He turned to face me, then stuck out his tongue and pushed it up over his lip and right up his nose !</p><p>\"Ewww! Gross!\"I yelled delightedly.</p><p>He pulled the tongue back and grinned. \"I've got the longest tongue in the world,\"he said. \"If my nose were big enough, I could poke my tongue all the way to the top, down my throat, and back out my mouth again.\"</p><p>\"You couldn't!\"I laughed.</p><p>\"Probably not.\"He giggled. \"But it's still pretty impressive.\"He stuck his tongue out again and this time licked around his nostrils, one after the other. It was revolting but hilarious.</p><p>\"That's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.\"I laughed.</p><p>\"I bet you wish you could do it,\"Evra said.</p><p>\"I wouldn't, even if I could,\"I lied. \"Don't you get snot all over your tongue?\"</p><p>\"I don't have any snot,\"Evra said.</p><p>\"What? No snot?\"</p><p>\"It's true,\"he said. \"My nose is different from yours. There's no snot or dirt or hairs. My nostrils are the cleanest part of my whole body.\"</p><p>\"What does it taste like?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Lick my snake's belly and you'll find out,\"he replied. \"It's the same taste as that.\"</p><p>I laughed and said I wasn't that interested!</p><p>Later, when Mr. Crepsley asked me what I'd done all day, I told him: \"I made a friend.\"</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>We'd been with the cirque two days and nights. I spent my days helping Evra and my nights with Mr. Crepsley, learning about vampires. I was going to bed earlier than I had been, though I rarely hit the sack before one or two in the morning.</p><p>Evra and I were tight friends. He was older than me, but he was shy - probably because of his abusive childhood - so we made a good team.</p><p>As the third day rolled by, I was gazing around the small groups of vans and cars and tents, feeling like I'd been part of the scene for years.</p><p>I was starting to suffer from the effects of going for too long without drinking human blood. I wasn't as strong as I had been, and couldn't move as quickly as I could before. My eyesight had dulled, and so had my hearing and sense of smell. I was a lot stronger and quicker than I'd been as a human, but I could feel my powers slipping a little more every day.</p><p>I didn't care. I'd rather lose some strength than drink from a human.</p><p>I was relaxing with Evra on the edge of the campsite that afternoon when we spotted a figure in the bushes.</p><p>\"Who's that?\"I asked.</p><p>\"A kid from a nearby village,\"Evra said. \"I've seen him hanging around before.\"</p><p>I watched the boy in the bushes. He was trying hard not to be seen, but to someone with my powers - fading though they were - he was as obvious as an elephant. I was curious to know what he was doing, so I turned to Evra and said, \"Let's have fun.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\"he asked.</p><p>\"Lean in and I'll tell you.\"</p>","<p>I whispered my plan in his ear. He grinned and nodded, then stood and pretended to yawn.</p><p>\"I'm leaving, Darren,\"he said. \"See you later.\"</p><p>\"See you, Evra,\"I replied loudly. I waited until he was gone, then stood and walked back to the camp myself.</p><p>When I was out of sight of the boy in the bushes, I went back, using the vans and tents to hide my movements. I walked about a hundred yards to the left, then crept forward until I could see the boy and sneaked toward him.</p><p>I stopped ten yards away. I was a little behind him, so he couldn't see me. His eyes were still glued to the camp. I looked over his head and saw Evra, who was even closer than I was. He made an ?okay? sign with his thumb and index finger.</p><p>I crouched down low and moaned.</p><p>\"Ohhhh,\"I groaned. \"Wwwooohhhh.\"</p><p>The boy stiffened and looked over his shoulder nervously. He couldn't see me.</p><p>\"Who's there?\"he asked.</p><p>\"Wraaarghhhh,\"Evra grunted on the other side of him.</p><p>The boy's head spun around in the other direction.</p><p>\"Who's there?\"he shouted.</p><p>\"Ohh-ohh-ohh,\"I snorted, like a gorilla.</p><p>\"I'm not afraid,\"the boy said, edging backward. \"You're just somebody playing a mean trick.\"</p><p>\"Eee-ee-ee-ee-ee,\"Evra screeched.</p><p>I shook a branch, Evra rattled a bush, then I tossed a stone into the area just ahead of the boy. His head was spinning around like a puppet's, darting all over the place. He didn't know whether it would be safer to run or stay.</p><p>\"Look, I don't know who you are,\"he began, \"but I'm -\"</p><p>Evra snuck up behind him and now, as the boy spoke, stuck out his extra-long tongue and ran it over the boy's neck, making a hissing snake noise.</p><p>That was enough for the boy. He screamed and ran for his life.</p><p>Evra and me ran after him, laughing our heads off, making all these noises. The boy fled through thorn bushes as though they weren't there, screaming for help.</p><p>We got tired after a few minutes and would have let him get away, but then he tripped and went sprawling into a patch of really high grass.</p><p>We stood, trying to spot him in the grass, but there was no sign of him.</p><p>\"Where is he?\"I asked.</p><p>\"I can't see him,\"Evra said.</p><p>\"Do you think he's all right?\"</p><p>\"I don't know.\"Evra looked worried. \"He might have fallen down a big hole or something.\"</p><p>\"Kid?\"I shouted. \"Are you okay?\"No answer. \"You don't need to be afraid. We won't hurt you. We were only kidding. We didn't -\"</p><p>There was a rustling noise behind us, then I felt a hand on my back, shoving me forward into the grass. Evra fell with me. When we sat up, spluttering with shock, we heard somebody laughing behind us.</p><p>We turned around slowly, and there was the kid, doubled over with laughter.</p><p>\"I got you! I got you!\"he sang. \"I saw you coming from the beginning. I was only pretending to be frightened. I ambushed you. Ha-ha!\"</p><p>He was making fun of us, and, though we felt pretty stupid, when we stood and looked at each other we burst out laughing. He'd led us into a patch of grass filled with sticky green seeds and we were covered in them from head to foot.</p><p>\"You look like a walking plant,\"I joked.</p><p>\"You look like the Jolly Green Giant,\"Evra replied.</p><p>\"Both of you look stupid,\"the boy said. We stared at him, and his smile faded a little. \"Well, you do ,\"he grumbled.</p><p>\"I suppose you think this is funny,\"I snarled. He nodded silently. \"Well, I've got news for you,\"I said, stepping closer, putting on the meanest face I could. I paused menacingly, then burst into a smile. \"It is!\"</p><p>He laughed happily, relieved that we could see the funny side of things, then stuck out his hands, one to each of us. \"Hey,\"he said as we shook. \"My name's Sam Grest. Nice to meetcha.\"</p><p>\"Hey, Sam,\"I said, and as I shook his hand I thought to myself, \"Looks like this is friend number two. Cool.\"</p><p>And Sam did become my friend. But by the time the Cirque Du Freak moved on, I was wishing with all my heart that I'd never even heard his name.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>Sam lived about a mile away, with his mom and dad, two younger brothers and a baby sister, three dogs, five cats, a turtle, and a tank full of tropical fish.</p><p>\"It's like living in Noah's ark,\"he said. \"I try to stay out of the house as much as possible. Mom and Dad don't mind. They think children should be free to express their individuality. As long as I come home for bed at night, they're happy. They don't even care if I miss school every once in a while. They think school's a despotic system of indoctrination, designed to crush the spirit and stamp out creativity.\"</p><p>Sam talked like that all the time. He was younger than me, but you wouldn't have known it by listening to him speak.</p><p>\"So, you two guys are with the show?\"he asked, rolling a piece of pickled onion around his mouth - he loved pickled onions and carried a small plastic jar of them with him. We'd returned to the spot at the edge of the clearing. Evra was lying in the grass, I was sitting on a low-hanging branch, and Sam was climbing the tree above me.</p><p>\"What sort of a show is it?\"he asked, before we could answer his first question. \"There are no signs on your vans. At first I thought you were tourists. Then, after observing for a while, I decided you must be performers of some kind.\"</p><p>\"We're masters of the macabre,\"Evra said. \"Agents of mutations. Lords of the surreal.\"He was speaking like that to show he could match Sam's big vocabulary. I wish I could have spouted a few smarty-pants sentences, but I'd never been good with words.</p><p>\"It's a magic show?\"Sam asked excitedly.</p><p>\"It's a freak show,\"I said.</p><p>\"A freak show?\"His jaw dropped open and a piece of pickled onion fell out. I had to move quickly to dodge it. \"Two-headed men and weirdos like that?\"</p><p>\"Sort of,\"I said, \"but our performers are magical, wonderful artists, not just people who look different.\"</p><p>\"Cool!\"He glanced at Evra. \"Of course, I could see from the start that you were dermatologically challenged,\"- he was talking about Evra's skin (I looked the word up in a dictionary later) - \"but I had no idea there might be other members like you among your company.\"</p><p>He looked over toward the camp, eyes bright with curiosity. \"This is most fascinating.\"He sighed. \"What other bizarre examples of the human form do your numbers include?\"</p><p>\"If you mean, 'What other sort of performers are there? the answer is tons,\"I told him. \"We have a bearded lady, of course.\"</p><p>\"A wolf-man,\"Evra said.</p><p>\"A man with two bellies,\"I added.</p><p>We went through the entire list, Evra mentioning some I'd never seen. The lineup of the Cirque Du Freak often changed. Performers came and went, depending on where the show was playing.</p><p>Sam was very impressed and, for the first time since we'd met, had nothing to say. He listened silently, eyes wide, sucking on one of his pickled onions, shaking his head once in a while as though he couldn't believe what he was hearing.</p><p>\"It's so cool,\"he said when we finished. \"You must be the luckiest guys on the planet. Living with real circus freaks, traveling the world, privy to solemn and magnificent secrets. I'd do anything to trade places with you...\"</p><p>I smiled to myself. I don't think he would have liked to trade places with me , not if he knew the full story.</p><p>\"Hey!\"he said. \"Could you help me join? I'm a hard worker and I'm really smart. I'd be an asset. Could I join? As an assistant? Please?\"</p><p>Evra and me smiled at each other.</p><p>\"I don't think so, Sam,\"Evra said. \"We don't take on many guys our age. If you were older, or if your parents wanted to join, that would be different.\"</p><p>\"But they wouldn't mind,\"Sam insisted. \"They'd be delighted for me. They're always saying travel broadens the mind. They'd love the idea of me going around the world, having adventures, seeing marvelous, mystical sights.\"</p><p>Evra shook his head. \"Sorry. Maybe when you're older.\"</p><p>Sam pouted and kicked some leaves off a nearby branch. They floated down over me and a few stuck in my hair.</p><p>\"It's not fair,\"he grumbled. \"People always say 'when you're older. Where would the world be if Alexander the Great had waited until he was older? And how about Joan of Arc? If she'd waited until she was older, the English might have conquered and colonized France. Who decides when someone's old enough to make decisions for himself? It should come down to the individual.\"</p><p>He ranted on for a while longer, complaining about adults and the \"corrupt frigging system\"and about the time being ripe for a young people's revolution. It was like listening to a crazy politician on TV.</p><p>\"If a kid wants to open a candy factory, let him open one,\"Sam stormed. \"If he wants to become a football star, fine. If he wants to be an explorer and set off for strange, cannibal-populated islands, okay! We're the slaves of the modern generation. We're -\"</p><p>\"Sam,\"Evra interrupted. \"Do you want to come see my snake?\"</p><p>Sam broke out into a smile. \"Do I?\"he yelled. \"I thought you'd never ask. C'mon, let's go.\"Leaping down out of the tree, he ran for the campsite as fast as he could, speeches forgotten. We followed slowly, laughing, feeling a whole lot older and wiser than we were.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>Sam thought the snake was the coolest thing he'd ever seen. He wasn't at all scared and didn't hesitate to wrap her around his neck like a scarf. He asked a bunch of questions: How long was she, what did she eat, how often did she shed her skin, where was she from, how fast could she move?</p><p>Evra answered all of Sam's questions. He was a snake expert. There wasn't a thing he didn't know about the serpent kingdom. He was even able to tell Sam roughly how many scales the snake had!</p><p>We gave Sam a guided tour of the campsite after that. We took him to see the wolf-man (Sam was pretty quiet outside of the hairy wolf-man's van, totally frightened by the snarling creature inside). We introduced him to Hans Hands. Then we ran into Rhamus Twobellies practicing his act. Evra asked if we could watch, and Rhamus let us. Sam's eyes almost popped out of his head when he saw Rhamus chew a glass into tiny pieces, swallow it, piece it back together inside his belly, and bring it up his throat and out his mouth.</p><p>I was going to grab Madam Octa and show Sam some of the tricks I could do with her, but I didn't feel too great. The lack of human blood in my diet was getting to me; my stomach grumbled a lot, no matter how much food I ate, and I sometimes got sick or had to sit down suddenly. I didn't want to faint or get sick with the tarantula out of her cage; I knew from experience how deadly she could be if you lost control of her for even a couple of seconds.</p><p>Sam would have stayed forever, but it was getting dark and I knew Mr. Crepsley would be waking soon. Evra and me had jobs to do, so we told him it was time he went home.</p><p>\"Can't I stay a little longer?\"he pleaded.</p><p>\"Your mother's probably looking for you for dinner,\"Evra said.</p><p>\"I can eat with you guys,\"Sam said.</p><p>\"There isn't enough food,\"I lied.</p><p>\"Well, I'm not very hungry, anyway,\"Sam said. \"I already ate most of my pickled onions.\"</p><p>\"Maybe he could stay,\"Evra said. I stared at him, surprised, but he winked to show he was only pretending.</p><p>\"Could I?\"Sam asked, psyched.</p><p>\"Sure,\"Evra said. \"But you'll have to help us with our jobs.\"</p><p>\"I'll do anything,\"Sam said. \"I don't mind. What is it?\"</p><p>\"The wolf-man needs to be fed, washed, and brushed,\"Evra said.</p><p>Sam's smile went away.</p><p>\"The wuh-wolf-muh-man?\"he asked nervously.</p><p>\"It's no problem,\"Evra told him. \"He's pretty quiet once he's been fed. He hardly ever bites his helpers. If he does attack, keep your head away from his mouth and stick an arm down his throat. It's better to lose an arm than your -\"</p><p>\"You know,\"Sam said quickly, \"I think I do have to go home. My mother said something about friends coming over tonight.\"</p><p>\"Oh. That's a pity.\"Evra grinned.</p><p>Sam backed away, gazing in the direction of the wolf-man's cage. He looked sad to be going, so I told him to stop.</p><p>\"What are you doing tomorrow?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Nothing,\"he said.</p><p>\"Do you want to come over in the afternoon and hang out with us?\"</p><p>\"Yeah!\"Sam said right back, then paused. \"I won't have to help feed and clean the...?\"He gulped loudly.</p><p>\"No,\"Evra said, still smiling.</p><p>\"Then I'll be here. See you tomorrow, guys.\"</p><p>\"See you, Sam,\"we said together.</p><p>He waved, turned, and left.</p><p>\"Sam's cool, isn't he?\"I said to Evra.</p><p>\"He's a good guy,\"Evra agreed. \"He could lose the whole sounding smart thing, and he's kind of a scaredy-cat, but otherwise he's cool.\"</p><p>\"Do you think he'd fit in if he did join the show?\"I asked.</p><p>Evra snorted sarcastically. \"Like a mouse in a house full of cats!\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\"I asked.</p><p>\"This life isn't for everyone. A few weeks away from his family, having to clean toilets and cook for thirty or forty people... He'd be running for the hills.\"</p><p>\"We do all right,\"I said.</p><p>\"We're different,\"Evra said. \"We're not like other people. This is what we're cut out for. Everybody has a place where they belong. This is ours. We're meant to...\"</p>","<p>He stopped and began to frown. He was looking over my head at something in the distance. I turned to see what was bothering him. For a few seconds I couldn't make out anything, but then, somewhere far off, coming through the trees to the east, I saw the flickering light of a burning torch.</p><p>\"What is that?\"I asked.</p><p>\"I'm not sure,\"Evra said.</p><p>We watched for a few minutes as the torch came closer. I saw figures moving beneath the branches of the trees. I couldn't tell how many there were, but it had to be at least six or seven. Then, as they came out from under the trees, I saw who they were, and goose-bumps sprang to life all over my neck and arms.</p><p>They were the small, blue-hooded people that Steve and I had seen the night of the show, the ones who helped sell sweets and toys to the crowd and assisted with the acts. I'd forgotten about those strange blue-hooded helpers. It had been a few months since that night, and I'd had so many other things on my mind.</p><p>They came out of the woods in pairs, one set after the other. I counted twelve in all, though there was a thirteenth member, a taller person walking behind the rest. He was the one carrying the torch.</p><p>\"Where did they come from?\"I asked Evra quietly.</p><p>\"I don't know,\"he answered. \"They left the show a few weeks ago. I have no idea where they went. They kept to themselves mostly.\"</p><p>\"Who are they?\"I asked.</p><p>\"They're -,\"he began to answer, but stopped all of a sudden. His eyes widened with fear.</p><p>It was the man bringing up the rear, the thirteenth, taller member of the group - visible now that he was closer - who scared Evra.</p><p>The blue-hooded people passed by silently. As the mysterious thirteenth person approached, I noticed he was dressed differently from the others. He wasn't very tall; he just looked big in comparison to the blue-hoods. He had short white hair, a thick pair of glasses, a sharp yellow suit, and long green rubber boots. He was pretty fat and walked with a weird waddle.</p><p>He smiled pleasantly at us as he passed. I smiled back, but Evra looked paralyzed, unable to move the muscles in his mouth.</p><p>The blue-hoods and the man with the torch walked farther into the campsite, all the way to the back, where they found a large clear spot. Then the blue-hoods began putting up a tent - they must have been carrying the equipment underneath their capes - while the larger man headed for Mr. Tall's van.</p><p>I studied Evra. He was shaking all over, and even though his face could never turn white - because of its natural color - it was paler than it had ever been before.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\"I asked.</p><p>He shook his head silently, unable to reply.</p><p>\"What is it? Why are you so scared? Who was that man?\"</p><p>\"He... It...\"Evra cleared his throat and took a deep breath. When he spoke, it was in a low, trembling voice, filled with sheer terror.</p><p>\"That was Mr. Tiny ,\"he said, and I couldn't get any more out of him for a long time after that.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>Evra's fear went away as the evening wore on, but he was slow to return to normal and was really edgy the whole night. I had to take his knife from him and do his share when he was peeling potatoes for dinner; I was afraid he might slice one of his fingers off.</p><p>After we'd eaten and helped clean the dishes, I asked Evra about the mysterious Mr. Tiny. We were in the tent, and Evra was playing with his snake.</p><p>He didn't answer immediately, and for a while I thought he wasn't going to, but in the end he sighed and began to speak.</p><p>\"Mr. Tiny is the leader of the Little People,\"he said.</p><p>\"The small guys in the blue-hooded capes?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Yup. He calls them Little People. He's their boss.</p><p>He doesn't come here a lot - it's been two years since I last saw him - but he gives me the creeps when he does. He's the spookiest man I've ever met.\"</p><p>\"He looked all right to me,\"I said.</p><p>\"That's what I thought the first time I saw him,\"Evra agreed. \"But wait till you've spoken to him. It's hard to explain, but every time he looks at me, I feel like he's planning to slaughter, skin, and roast me.\"</p><p>\"He eats people?\"I asked, freaked out.</p><p>\"I don't know,\"Evra said. \"Maybe he does, maybe he doesn't. But you get the feeling he wants to eat you. And it's not just me being stupid; I've talked about it with other members of the Cirque and they feel the same way. Nobody likes him. Even Mr. Tall gets fidgety when Mr. Tiny's around.\"</p><p>\"Well, the Little People must like him, don't they?\"I asked. \"They follow and obey him, right?\"</p><p>\"Maybe they're scared of him,\"Evra said. \"Maybe he forces them to obey him. Maybe they're his slaves.\"</p><p>\"Have you ever asked them?\"</p><p>\"They don't talk,\"Evra said. \"I don't know if it's because they can't or if they don't want to, but nobody in the circus has ever been able to get a word out of them. They're really helpful and they'll do whatever you ask but they're as silent as walking dummies.\"</p><p>\"Have you ever seen their faces?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Once,\"Evra said. \"Usually they don't let their hoods slip, but one day I was helping a couple of them move a heavy machine. It fell on one of the Little People and crushed him. He didn't make a sound, even though he must have been in a huge amount of pain. His hood fell to the side and I caught a glimpse of his face.</p><p>\"It was disgusting,\"Evra said quietly, stroking the snake. \"Full of scars and stitches all crumpled together, like some giant had squeezed it with his claws. He didn't have ears or a nose, and there was some kind of mask over his mouth. The skin was gray and dead-looking, and his eyes were like two green bowls near the top of his face. He didn't have hair, either.\"</p><p>Evra shivered at the memory. I felt cold myself, thinking about his description.</p><p>\"What happened to him?\"I asked. \"Did he die?\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\"Evra said. \"A couple of his brothers - I always think of them as brothers, though they probably aren't - came and took him away.\"</p><p>\"You never saw him again?\"</p><p>\"They all look the same,\"Evra said. \"Some are a little smaller or taller than the others, but there's no real way of telling them apart. Believe me - I've tried.\"</p><p>Weirder and weirder. I was really intrigued by Mr. Tiny and his Little People. I'd always liked mysteries. Maybe I could solve this one. Maybe, with my vampire powers, I could find a way to talk to one of the hooded creatures.</p><p>\"Where do the Little People come from?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Nobody knows,\"Evra said. \"There's usually about four or six of them with the Cirque. Sometimes more turn up by themselves. Sometimes Mr. Tiny brings in new ones. It was weird that none were here when you came.\"</p><p>\"You think it had something to do with me and Mr. Crepsley coming?\"I asked.</p><p>\"I doubt it,\"Evra said. \"It was probably just a coincidence. Or fate.\"He paused. \"Which is another thing: Mr. Tiny's first name is Desmond.\"</p><p>\"So?\"</p><p>\"He tells people to call him Des.\"</p><p>\"So?\"I asked again.</p><p>\"Put it together with his last name,\"Evra told me.</p><p>I did. Mr. Des Tiny. Mr. Des-Tiny. Mr...</p><p>\"Mr. Destiny ,\"I whispered, and Evra nodded seriously.</p><p>I was dying of curiosity and asked Evra a bunch more questions, but his answers were limited. He knew almost nothing about Mr. Tiny, and only a little more about the Little People. They ate meat. They smelled funny. They moved around slowly most of the time. They either didn't feel pain or couldn't show it. And they had no sense of humor.</p><p>\"How do you know that?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Bradley Stretch,\"Evra answered darkly. \"He used to be with the show. He had rubbery bones and could make his arms and legs stretch.</p><p>\"He wasn't very nice. He was always playing practical jokes on us, and he had a nasty way of laughing. He didn't just make you look like an idiot: He made you feel like one too.</p><p>\"We played a show in an Arabian palace. It was a private show for a sheik. He enjoyed all the acts, but especially liked Bradley's. The two started talking, and Bradley told the sheik he couldn't wear jewelry, because it always slipped off or broke because of the changing shape of his body.</p><p>\"The sheik ran away and came back with a small gold bracelet. He gave it to Bradley and told him to put it on his wrist. Bradley did. Then the sheik told him to try shaking it off.</p><p>\"So Bradley made his arm small and big, short and long, but he couldn't shake the bracelet loose. The sheik said it was magic and could only be removed if the wearer wanted to take it off. It was really valuable, priceless, but he gave it to Bradley as a gift.</p><p>\"Getting back to the Little People,\"Evra said. \"Bradley loved to tease them. He was always finding new ways to trick them. He made traps to hang them up in the air by their feet. He set their capes on fire. He squirted liquid laundry detergent on ropes they were using to make their hands slip, or glue to make them stick. He put thumbtacks in their food and he made their tent collapse and locked them in a van.\"</p><p>\"Why was he so mean?\"I asked.</p><p>\"I think because they never reacted,\"Evra said. \"He liked to see people get upset, but the Little People never cried or screamed or lashed out. They didn't seem to notice his pranks. At least, everybody thought they didn't notice...\"</p><p>Evra made a funny noise that was half a laugh, half a moan.</p><p>\"One morning we woke up and Bradley had disappeared. Nowhere to be found. We searched for him, but when he didn't turn up, we moved on. We weren't worried; performers join and leave the Cirque pretty much as they please. It wasn't the first time somebody had sneaked away in the middle of the night.</p><p>\"I didn't think any more about it until a week or so later. Mr. Tiny had come to see us the day before and took all but two of the Little People with him. Mr. Tall told me I had to help the leftover pair with their duties. I cleaned up their tent and rolled up their hammocks - they all sleep in hammocks. That's where I got mine from. Did I mention that before?\"He hadn't, but I didn't want to sidetrack him, so I said nothing.</p><p>\"After that,\"he went on, \"I washed their pot. It was a big black pot, set on a fire in the middle of the tent. The place had to have been full of smoke whenever they cooked because the pot was covered in grime.</p><p>\"I took it outside and tried to scrape the grime - scraps of meat and pieces of bone - onto the grass. I scrubbed it thoroughly, then took it back inside. Next I decided to pick up the pieces of meat in the grass and throw them to the wolf-man. 'Waste not, want not, like Mr. Tall always says.</p><p>\"As I was picking up the meat and bone, I saw something glistening...\"</p><p>Evra turned away and rifled through a bag on the ground. When he turned back, he was holding a small gold bracelet. He let my eyes linger on it, then slipped it on over his left hand. He shook his arm as fast as he could but the bracelet never moved.</p><p>When he stopped shaking his arm, he slid the bracelet off with the fingers of his right hand and tossed it to me. I examined it but didn't put it on.</p><p>\"The bracelet the sheik gave to Bradley Stretch?\"I guessed.</p><p>\"The same,\"Evra said.</p><p>I handed it back.</p><p>\"I don't know whether it was because of something really bad he did,\"Evra said, fingering the bracelet, \"or if they were just tired of the nonstop teasing. What I do know is, ever since, I've gone out of my way to be polite to the small, silent people in the dark blue capes.\"</p><p>\"What did you do with the remains of... I mean, with the scraps of meat?\"I asked. \"Did you bury them?\"</p><p>\"Heck, no,\"Evra said. \"I fed them to the wolf-man, like I meant to.\"Then, in response to my horrified look, he said, \"Waste not, want not, remember?\"</p><p>I stared at him for a second, then began to laugh. Evra laughed, too. In a minute we were both rolling around on the floor in hysterics.</p><p>\"We shouldn't laugh.\"I caught my breath. \"Poor Bradley Stretch. We should be crying.\"</p><p>\"I'm laughing too hard to cry,\"Evra gasped.</p><p>\"I wonder what he tasted like?\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\"Evra said. \"But I bet he was rubbery.\"</p><p>That made us laugh even more. Tears rolled from our eyes and trickled down our cheeks. It was a terrible thing to laugh at, but we couldn't help it.</p><p>In the middle of our fit of hysteria, the flap to the door of our tent was pulled aside by an inquisitive head, and Hans Hands entered. \"What's the joke?\"he asked, but we couldn't tell him. I tried, but every time I started, I began to laugh again.</p><p>He shook his head and rolled his eyes. Then, when we finally quieted down, he told us why he was there.</p><p>\"I have a message for you two,\"he said. \"Mr. Tall wants you to report to his van as soon as possible.\"</p><p>\"What's up, Hans?\"Evra asked. He was still laughing. \"Why does he want us?\"</p><p>\"He doesn't,\"Hans said. \"Mr. Tiny is with him. He's the one who wants you.\"</p><p>Our laughter stopped instantly. Hans let himself out without any further words.</p><p>\"Mr. Tuh-tuh-tuh-Tiny wants us,\"Evra gasped.</p><p>\"I heard,\"I said. \"What do you think he wants?\"</p><p>\"I don't kn-kn-kn-know,\"Evra stuttered, though I could tell what was going through his mind. It was the same thing that was rushing through mine. We were thinking of the Little People, Bradley Stretch, and the big black pot full of scraps of human meat and bone.</p><p>Chapter FOURTEEN</p><p>Mr. tall, Mr. Crepsley, and Mr. Tiny were in the van when we entered. Evra was shaking like a leaf, but I wasn't really nervous. But when I saw the worried looks on Mr. Tall's and Mr. Crepsley's faces and realized how uneasy they were, it put me on edge a little.</p>","<p>\"Come in, boys,\"Mr. Tiny welcomed us, as though it was his van and not Mr. Tall's. \"Sit down, make yourselves at home.\"</p><p>\"I'll stand if that's okay,\"Evra said, trying not to let us hear the chatter of his teeth.</p><p>\"I'll stand, too,\"I said, following Evra's lead.</p><p>\"As you wish,\"Mr. Tiny said. He was the only one sitting.</p><p>\"I've been hearing a lot about you, young Darren Shan,\"Mr. Tiny said. He was rolling something between his hands: a heart-shaped watch. I could hear it ticking whenever there was a pause in his speech.</p><p>\"You're quite the boy, by all accounts,\"Mr. Tiny went on. \"A most remarkable young man. Sacrificed everything to save a friend. There aren't many who would do as much. People are so self-centered these days. It's good to see the world can still produce heroes.\"</p><p>\"I'm no hero,\"I said, blushing at the compliment.</p><p>\"Of course you are,\"he insisted. \"What is a hero but a person who lays everything on the line for the good of somebody else?\"</p><p>I smiled proudly. I couldn't understand why Evra was so afraid of this nice, strange man. There was nothing terrible about Mr. Tiny. I kind of liked him.</p><p>\"Larten tells me you're reluctant to drink human blood,\"Mr. Tiny continued. \"I don't blame you. Nasty, repulsive stuff. Can't stand it. Apart from young children, of course. Their blood is scrump-dilly-icious.\"</p><p>I frowned. \"You can't drink blood from them,\"I said. \"They're too small. If you took blood from a young child, you'd kill it.\"</p><p>His eyes widened and so did his smile.</p><p>\"So ?\"he asked softly.</p><p>A chill ran down my spine. If he had been joking, it would have been in really poor taste, but I could have overlooked it (hadn't I just been laughing about poor Bradley Stretch?). But I could tell from his expression that he was totally serious.</p><p>All of a sudden I knew why this man was so feared. He was evil. Not just bad or nasty, but pure demonic evil. This was a man I could imagine killing thousands of people just to hear them scream.</p><p>\"You know,\"Mr. Tiny said, \"your face seems familiar. Have we met before, Darren Shan?\"</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\"Are you certain?\"he asked. \"You look very familiar.\"</p><p>\"I... would have... remembered,\"I stuttered.</p><p>\"You can't always trust memory.\"Mr. Tiny smiled. \"It can be a deceptive monster. Still, no matter. Maybe I'm confusing you with someone else.\"</p><p>By the way his lips twisted into a grin (how did I ever think that was a nice smile?), I could see he didn't think that. But I was sure he was wrong. There's no way I would have forgotten meeting a creature like him.</p><p>\"Down to business,\"Mr. Tiny said. His hands tightened on the heart-shaped watch and for a second they seemed to glow and melt into its ticking face. I blinked and rubbed my eyes. When I looked again, the illusion - which it must have been - was gone.</p><p>\"You boys saw me arrive with my Little People,\"Mr. Tiny said. \"They're new converts to my cause and are a little unsure of the ropes. Normally I'd stick around and teach them how to work, but I have business elsewhere. Still, they're smart and I'm sure they'll learn.</p><p>\"However, while they're learning, I'd like it if you two fine, young men would help ease them into the swing of things. You won't have to do much. Mainly I want you to find food for them. They have such big appetites.</p><p>\"How about it, boys? I've got the permission of your guardians.\"He nodded at Mr. Tall and Mr. Crepsley, who didn't seem happy about the arrangement, but looked resigned. \"Will you help poor old Mr. Tiny and his Little People?\"</p><p>I looked at Evra. I could see he didn't want to do it, but he nodded his head anyway. I did the same.</p><p>\"Excellent!\"Mr. Tiny boomed. \"Young Evra Von knows what my darlings like, I'm sure. If you have any problems, report to Hibernius and he'll help you out.\"</p><p>Mr. Tiny waved a hand to let us know we could leave. Evra began edging backward immediately, but I held my ground.</p><p>\"Excuse me,\"I said, summoning all my courage, \"but why do you call them Little People?\"</p><p>Mr. Tiny turned around slowly. If he was surprised by my question, he didn't show it, though I could see the mouths of Mr. Tall and Mr. Crepsley dropping.</p><p>\"Because they're little,\"he explained calmly.</p><p>\"I know that,\"I said. \"But don't they have another name? An official name? If somebody mentioned 'Little People' to me, I'd think they were talking about elves or leprechauns.\"</p><p>Mr. Tiny smiled. \"They are elves and leprechauns,\"he said. \"All around the world, you will find legends and stories of small, magical people. Legends have to start somewhere. These legends started with my short, loyal friends.\"</p><p>\"Are you telling me those dwarfs in blue capes are elves ?\"I asked disbelievingly.</p><p>\"No,\"he said. \"Elves don't exist. Those dwarfs - as you so rudely put it - were seen, long ago, by ignorant people, who invented names for them: elves or fairies or sprites. They made up stories about what they were and what they could do.\"</p><p>\"What can they do?\"I asked.</p><p>Mr. Tiny's smile slipped. \"I heard you were quite the one for asking questions,\"he growled, \"but nobody told me you were this nosy. Remember, Darren Shan: Curiosity killed the cat.\"</p><p>\"I'm not a cat,\"I said boldly.</p><p>Mr. Tiny leaned forward, and his face darkened. \"If you ask more questions,\"he hissed, \"you might find yourself turned into one. Nothing in life is forever, not even the human form.\"</p><p>The watch in his hands glowed again, red like a real heart, and I decided it was time to leave.</p><p>\"Go to bed now and get a good night's sleep,\"Mr. Crepsley told me before I left. \"There will be no lessons tonight.\"</p><p>\"And rise early, boys,\"Mr. Tiny added, waving goodbye. \"My Little People are always hungry in the mornings. It's not wise to let their hunger go unattended. You never know what they might set their minds - and teeth - on if they go unfed for too long.\"</p><p>We hurried out the door and raced back to our tent, where we fell to the floor and listened to our hearts beating loudly.</p><p>\"Are you crazy?\"Evra asked when he could speak. \"Talking to Mr. Tiny like that, asking him questions, you must be out of your mind!\"</p><p>\"You're right,\"I said, thinking back on the encounter, wondering where I'd gotten the nerve from. \"I must be.\"</p><p>Evra shook his head in disgust. It was early, but we crawled into bed anyway. We lay awake for hours, Staring at the ceiling of the tent. When I finally fell asleep I dreamed of Mr. Tiny and his heart-shaped watch. Only, in my dreams, it wasn't a watch. It was a real human heart. Mine. And when he squeezed it...</p><p>Agony.</p><p>Chapter FIFTEEN</p><p>Igot up early and went hunting for food for the Little People. We were tired and cranky, and it took time for us to come to life.</p><p>After a while I asked Evra what the Little People liked to eat.</p><p>\"Meat,\"he replied. \"Any kind of animal, they don't care.\"</p><p>\"How many animals will we need to catch?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Well, there's twelve of them, but they don't eat a lot. I guess one rabbit or hedgehog between two of them. A larger animal - a fox or a dog - might feed three or four.\"</p><p>\"Can you eat hedgehogs?\"I asked.</p><p>\"The Little People can,\"Evra said. \"They're not fussy. They'd eat rats and mice, too, but we'd have to catch a lot to feed so many, so they're not worth bothering with.\"</p><p>We each took a sack and headed off in different directions. Evra told me the meat didn't have to be fresh, so if I found a dead badger or squirrel, I could stick it in the bag and save some time.</p><p>I spotted a fox a couple of minutes into the hunt. It had a chicken in its mouth and was on its way home. I tracked it until the moment was right, then jumped on it from behind a bush and dragged it to the ground.</p><p>The dead chicken flew out of its mouth and the fox turned, snarling, to bite me. Before it could attack, I moved quickly, grabbed its neck, and twisted sharply to the left. There was a loud crack, and that was the end of the fox.</p><p>I chucked the chicken into the bag - a nice bonus - but hung on to the fox for a few minutes. I needed blood, so I found a vein, made a small cut, and started sucking.</p><p>Part of me hated this - it seemed so inhuman - but I reminded myself that I wasn't human anymore. I was a half-vampire. This was how my kind acted. I'd felt bad killing foxes and rabbits and pigs and sheep the first few times. But I got used to it. I had to.</p><p>Could I get used to drinking human blood? That was the question. I hoped I could avoid feeding on humans, but by the way I was running out of energy, I knew eventually I'd have to... or die.</p><p>I tossed the fox's corpse into the bag, then went on hunting. I found a family of rabbits washing their ears in a nearby pond. I crept as close as I could, then struck without warning. They scattered in fear, but not before I got my sharp fingernails into three of the little ones.</p><p>I added them to the contents of the bag and decided that was enough for this trip. I figured the fox, chicken, and rabbits would easily feed six or seven of the blue-hoods.</p><p>I met Evra back at camp. He'd found a dead dog and a badger and was feeling pretty pleased with himself. \"The easiest day of hunting I've ever had,\"he said. \"Plus I found a field full of cows. We'll go there tonight and steal one. That'll keep the Little People going for a day or two at least.\"</p><p>\"Won't the farmer who owns them notice?\"I asked.</p><p>\"There are at least a hundred of them,\"Evra said. \"By the time he gets around to counting them, we'll be long gone.\"</p><p>\"But cows cost money,\"I said. \"I don't mind killing wild animals, but stealing from a farmer is different.\"</p><p>\"We'll leave money for him,\"Evra said with a sigh.</p><p>\"Where will we get it?\"I asked.</p><p>Evra smiled. \"The one thing we're never short of at the Cirque Du Freak is money,\"he assured me.</p><p>Later, our chores finished, we teamed up with Sam again. He'd been waiting in the bushes for hours.</p><p>\"Why didn't you come into the camp?\"I asked.</p><p>\"I didn't want to interrupt,\"he said. \"Besides, I thought somebody might have let the wolf-man out. He didn't seem to like me when I saw him yesterday.\"</p><p>\"He's like that with everyone,\"Evra told him.</p><p>\"Maybe,\"Sam said, \"but I figure it's best not to take chances.\"</p><p>Sam was in a questioning mood. He'd obviously been thinking about us a lot since the day before.</p><p>\"Don't you ever wear shoes?\"he asked Evra.</p><p>\"No,\"Evra said. \"The soles of my feet are extra tough.\"</p><p>\"What happens if you step on a thorn or a nail?\"Sam asked.</p><p>Evra smiled, sat down, and gave Sam his foot. \"Try scratching it with a sharp twig,\"he said.</p><p>Sam broke off a branch and poked Evra's sole. It was like trying to make a hole in tough leather.</p><p>\"A sharp piece of glass might slice me,\"Evra said,</p><p>\"but that doesn't happen very often, and my skin's getting tougher every year.\"</p><p>\"I wish I had skin like that,\"Sam said enviously. Then he turned to me. \"How come you wear the same suit all the time?\"he asked.</p><p>I looked down at the suit I'd been buried alive in. I'd meant to ask for some new clothes but had forgotten.</p><p>\"I like it,\"I said.</p><p>\"I've never seen a kid wearing a suit like that before,\"Sam said. \"Not unless they were at a wedding or a funeral. Are you forced to wear it?\"</p><p>\"No,\"I said.</p><p>\"Did you ask your parents if you could join the Cirque?\"Evra said then, to distract Sam's attention.</p><p>\"No,\"Sam sighed. \"I told them about it, of course, but I figured it would be best to take it slowly. I won't tell them until just before I leave, or maybe not until I'm gone.\"</p><p>\"So you still plan to join?\"I asked.</p><p>\"You bet!\"Sam said. \"I know you tried scaring me away, but I'll get in somehow. You wait. I'll keep coming around. I'll read books and learn everything there is to know about freak shows, and then I'll go to your boss and state my case. He won't be able to turn me down.\"</p><p>Evra and I smiled at each other. We knew Sam's dream would never lead to anything, but we didn't have the heart to tell him.</p><p>We went to see an old, deserted railroad station, about two miles away, which Sam had told us about.</p><p>\"It's great,\"he said. \"They used to work on trains there, repair and paint them and stuff like that. It was a busy station when it was open. Then a new station opened closer to the city and this place went bankrupt. It's a great place to play. There are rusty old railroad tracks, empty sheds, a guardhouse, and a couple of ancient train cars.\"</p><p>\"Is it safe?\"Evra asked.</p><p>\"My mother says it isn't,\"Sam told us. \"It's one of the few places she tells me to stay away from. She says I could fall through the roof of one of the cars or trip on a rail or something. But I've been there lots of times and nothing's ever happened.\"</p><p>It was another sunny day, and we were walking slowly under the shade of the trees when I smelled something strange. I stopped and sniffed the air. Evra could smell it, too.</p><p>\"What is that?\"I asked.</p><p>\"I don't know,\"he said, sniffing the air next to me. \"Which way is it coming from?\"</p><p>\"I can't tell,\"I said. It was a thick, heavy, sour smell.</p><p>Sam hadn't smelled anything and kept walking ahead of us. Then he realized we weren't beside him, Hopped, and turned to see what was going on.</p>","<p>\"What's wrong?\"he asked. \"Why aren't you-\"</p><p>\"Gotcha !\"a voice yelled behind me, and before I could move I felt a firm hand grab my shoulder and spin me around. I saw a large, hairy face, and then suddenly I was falling backward, thrown off-balance by the force of the hand.</p><p>Chapter SIXTEEN</p><p>Ifell hard on the ground and sprained my arm. I screamed with pain, then tried twisting away from the hairy figure above me. Before I could do anything, he was crouching by my side with a fierce look on his face.</p><p>\"Oh, hey, man, I didn't hurt you, did I?\"He had a friendly voice, and I realized my life wasn't in danger; the look on his face was one of concern, not anger.</p><p>\"I didn't mean to freak you out,\"the man said. \"I was just trying to scare you a little, man, for fun.\"</p><p>I sat up and rubbed my elbow. \"I'm okay,\"I said.</p><p>\"You're sure? It ain't broken, is it? I've got herbs that can help, if it is.\"</p><p>\"Herbs can't fix broken bones,\"Sam said. He was now standing beside Evra.</p><p>\"They sure can't,\"the stranger agreed, \"but they can elevate you to planes of consciousness where worldly concerns like broken bones are nothing but minor blips on the cosmic map.\"He paused and stroked his beard. \"Of course, they burn out your brain cells, too...\"</p><p>Sam's blank face showed that even he didn't understand that long sentence.</p><p>\"I'm okay,\"I said again. I stood up and rotated my arm. \"I just twisted it. It'll be fine in a couple of minutes.\"</p><p>\"Man, that's good to hear,\"the stranger said. \"I'd hate to be the cause of bodily harm. Hurt's a bad trip, man.\"</p><p>I studied him in more detail. He was big and chubby, with a bushy black beard and long, scraggly hair. His clothes were dirty and there was no way he'd had a bath recently, because he stank to high heaven. That's what the strange smell had been. He was really friendly looking; it made me feel stupid thinking about how afraid of him I'd been.</p><p>\"Are you guys locals?\"the man asked.</p><p>\"I am,\"Sam said. \"These guys are with the circus.\"</p><p>\"Circus?\"The man smiled. \"There's a circus around here? Oh, man, how did I miss it? Where is it? I love the circus. I never pass up a chance to see clowns in action.\"</p><p>\"It's not that sort of circus,\"Sam told him. \"It's a freak show.\"</p><p>\"A freak show?\"The man stared at Sam, then at Evra, whose scales and color pretty much marked him out as one of the performers. \"Are you part of a freak show, man?\"he asked.</p><p>Evra nodded shyly.</p><p>\"They don't mistreat you, do they?\"the man asked. \"They don't whip you or under-feed you or make you do things you don't want to?\"</p><p>\"No.\"Evra shook his head.</p><p>\"You're there of your own free will?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\"Evra said. \"All of us are. It's our home.\"</p><p>\"Oh. Well, that's okay,\"the man said, smiling again. \"You hear rumors about those small traveling shows. You...\"He slapped his forehead. \"Oh man, I haven't introduced myself, have I? I'm so dumb sometimes. R.V.'s the name.\"</p><p>\"R.V.? That's a funny name,\"I remarked.</p><p>He coughed with embarrassment. \"Well,\"he said, lowering his voice to a whisper, \"it's short for Reggie Veggie.\"</p><p>\"Reggie Veggie ?\"I laughed.</p><p>\"Yeah,\"he said. \"Reggie's my real name. Reggie Veggie's what they called me in school, because I'm a vegetarian. Well, I never liked that, so I asked them to call me R.V. instead. Some did, but not many.\"He looked miserable at the memory. \"You can call me Reggie Veggie if you want,\"he told us.</p><p>\"R.V. is fine by me,\"I assured him.</p><p>\"Me, too,\"Evra said.</p><p>\"And me,\"Sam added.</p><p>\"Cool!\"R.V. brightened up. \"So, that's my name out in the open. How about you three?\"</p><p>\"Darren Shan,\"I told him, and we shook hands.</p><p>\"Sam Grest.\"</p><p>\"Evra Von.\"</p><p>\"Evra Von what?\"R.V. asked, as I had when I first met Evra.</p><p>\"Just plain Von,\"Evra said.</p><p>\"Oh.\"R.V. smiled. \"Cool!\"</p><p>R.V. was an ecowarrior, here to stop a road from being built. He was a member of NOP - Nature's Opposing Protectors - and had traveled the country saving forests and lakes and animals and stuff like that.</p><p>He offered to show us around his camp, and we jumped at the chance. The railway station could wait. This was an opportunity that wouldn't come every day.</p><p>He talked about the environment nonstop as we walked. He told us about all the crappy things being done to Mother Nature, the forests we were destroying, the rivers we were polluting, the air we were poisoning, the animals we were driving to extinction.</p><p>\"And this is all in our own country!\"he said. \"I'm not talking about stuff happening somewhere else. This is what we're doing to our own land!\"</p><p>NOP was fighting to save the earth from greedy, dangerous humans who didn't care what they did to it. I had journeyed up and down the country trying to make other people aware of the dangers. They gave out pamphlets and books about how to protect the environment.</p><p>\"But raising awareness ain't enough,\"R.V. told us. \"It's a start, but we must do more. We have to stop the pollution and destruction of the countryside. Take this place: They were going to build a road through an old burial ground, a place where people buried their dead thousands of years ago. Can you imagine that, man? Destroying a part of history, just to save drivers ten or twenty minutes!\"</p><p>R.V. shook his head sadly. \"These are crazy times, man,\"he said. \"The things we're doing to this planet... In the future - assuming there is one - people will look back on what we've done and call us idiotic barbarians.\"</p><p>He was very passionate about the environment, and after listening to him for a while, so were Sam, Evra and me. I hadn't thought about it much before, but after a couple of hours with R.V., I realized I should have. As R.V. said, those who don't think and act now can't complain when the world crumbles around their ears later.</p><p>His campsite was an interesting place. The people - twenty or so - slept in handmade huts that had been built out of branches and leaves and shrubs. Most were as dirty and smelly as R.V., but they were also cheerful and kind and generous.</p><p>\"How did you stop the road from being built?\"Sam asked.</p><p>\"We dug tunnels under the land,\"R.V. said. \"And we sabotaged the machines they sent in. And we alerted the media. Rich dudes hate having cameras pointed at them. One TV news crew is as good as twenty active warriors.\"</p><p>Evra asked R.V. if they ever fought hand to hand. R.V. said NOP didn't believe in violent confrontation, but we could see from the look on his face that he wasn't happy about that. \"If I had my way,\"he said, \"we'd give as good as we got. We're too nice sometimes. Man, if I was in charge, we'd give those turkeys a taste of hell!\"</p><p>R.V. invited us to stay for lunch. It wasn't very good food - there was no meat, just a bunch of vegetables and rice and fruit - but we ate a lot to be polite.</p><p>They had lots of mushrooms as well - big and oddly colored - but R.V. wouldn't let us eat any of those.</p><p>\"When you're older, man,\"he said with a laugh.</p><p>We left soon after lunch. The members of NOP had duties and jobs they had to do, and we didn't want to be in the way.</p><p>R.V. told us we could come back any time, but that they'd probably be moving on in a couple of days.</p><p>\"We've almost won the fight here,\"he said. \"Another few days and it'll be time to strike out for new pastures. Battles come and go, man, but the war is never-ending.\"</p><p>We waved good-bye and headed for home.</p><p>\"That R.V.'s weird,\"Sam said after a while. \"Can you imagine giving up everything to go off and fight for animals and the countryside?\"</p><p>\"He's doing what he believes in,\"Evra said.</p><p>\"I know,\"Sam said. \"I think it's cool that he's doing it. We need people like him. It's too bad there aren't more of them. Still, it's a weird way to live, don't you think? You'd have to be pretty dedicated. I don't think I could become an environmental warrior.\"</p><p>\"Me neither,\"I agreed.</p><p>\"I could,\"Evra said.</p><p>\"You could not,\"I scoffed.</p><p>\"Why not?\"he asked. \"I could take my snake and live with them and fight with them.\"</p><p>\"You just couldn't,\"I insisted.</p><p>\"Why not?\"</p><p>\"Because you're not smelly enough!\"I laughed.</p><p>Evra made a face. \"They were a little on the crunchy-granola side, weren't they?\"he admitted.</p><p>\"They smell worse than my feet when I haven't changed my socks for a week!\"Sam exclaimed.</p><p>\"Still,\"Evra said, \"I can think of lots of worst-ways to spend my time when I grow up. I'd kind of like to be like R.V.\"</p><p>\"Me, too,\"Sam said.</p><p>I shrugged. \"I guess I could get used to it.\"</p><p>We were in a good mood and talked about NOP and R.V. the whole way back to camp. None of us had any idea of the trouble the nice ecowarrior would soon create... or the tragedy he would unintentionally cause.</p><p>Chapter SEVENTEEN</p><p>The next few days went by lazily. Evra and me were kept busy with our chores and with feeding the Little People. I'd tried talking to a couple of the silent blue-hooded creatures, but none of them looked at me when I spoke.</p><p>It was impossible to tell them apart. One stood out because he - or she (or it) - was taller than the others, and one was shorter, and another limped on his left leg. But the rest looked exactly alike.</p><p>Sam was helping out more and more around the camp. We didn't take him with us when we went hunting, but we let him pitch in with most of our other jobs. He was a hard worker, determined to impress us and earn himself a full-time position with the Cirque.</p><p>I didn't see much of Mr. Crepsley. He knew I had to be up early to hunt for the Little People's food, so he left me alone most of the time. I was happy that way; I didn't want him bugging me about drinking human blood.</p><p>Then Cormac Limbs arrived early one morning, which caused great excitement.</p><p>\"You've got to see this guy,\"Evra said, dragging me behind him. \"He's the most amazing performer who ever lived.\"</p><p>There was already a large crowd around Cormac when we arrived at Mr. Tall's van (where he reported in to). People were slapping him on the back and asking what he'd been up to and where he'd been. He smiled at everybody, shook hands, and answered questions. He might have been a star, but he wasn't big-headed.</p><p>\"Evra Von!\"he shouted when he saw the snake-boy. He reached over and gave Evra a hug. \"How's my favorite two-legged reptile?\"</p><p>\"Fine,\"Evra said.</p><p>\"Have you shed your skin lately?\"Cormac asked.</p><p>\"Not recently,\"Evra said.</p><p>\"Remember,\"Cormac said, \"I want it when you do. It's valuable. Human snakeskin is worth more than gold in some countries.\"</p><p>\"You can have as much of it as you like,\"Evra assured him. Then he pushed me forward. \"Cormac, this is Darren Shan, a friend of mine. He's new at the Cirque and hasn't seen you before.\"</p><p>\"Never seen Cormac Limbs?!\"Cormac shouted, pretending to be upset. \"How can this be? I thought everybody in the world had seen the magnificent Cormac Limbs in action.\"</p><p>\"I've never even heard of you,\"I told him.</p><p>He clutched his chest as though suffering a heart attack.</p><p>\"What do you do?\"I asked.</p><p>Cormac looked around at the crowd. \"Should I give a demonstration?\"</p><p>\"Yeah!\"they shouted eagerly.</p><p>Cormac looked at Mr. Tall, standing at the back of the crowd. Mr. Tall sighed and nodded. \"You may as well,\"he said. \"They won't leave you alone until you do.\"</p><p>\"All right then,\"Cormac said. \"Stand back and give me room.\"</p><p>The crowd moved back immediately. I started to move with them, but Cormac laid a hand on my shoulder and told me to stay.</p><p>\"Now,\"he said to the crowd, \"I've been traveling for a long time and I'm too tired to go through my entire routine, so we'll keep this short and sweet.\"</p><p>He made his right hand into a fist, then stuck out his index finger. \"Darren, will you put this finger in your mouth?\"he asked.</p><p>I glanced at Evra, who signaled for me to do what Cormac asked.</p><p>\"Now,\"Cormac said, \"bite down on it, please.\"</p><p>I bit softly.</p><p>\"Harder,\"Cormac said.</p><p>I bit slightly harder.</p><p>\"Come on, boy,\"Cormac shouted. \"Put some backbone into it. Work those jaws. Are you a shark or a mouse?\"</p><p>Okay. He wanted me to bite hard? Then I would.</p><p>I opened my mouth and bit down quickly, meaning to give him a shock. Instead, I was the one who was shocked, because I bit clean through the finger and snapped it right off !</p><p>I fell back in terror and spat the dead finger from my mouth. My eyes shot up at Cormac Limbs. I expected him to scream, but he only laughed and held up his hand.</p><p>There was no blood where I'd bitten the finger off, only a white, jagged stump. As I watched, the most amazing thing happened: The finger began to grow back !</p><p>I thought I had to be imagining it, but as the seconds passed it kept growing, and pretty soon it was full-length again. Cormac held it rigidly in place a few seconds longer, then flexed it in and out to show it was as good as new.</p><p>The crowd cheered, and I felt my heart slow back down to normal.</p><p>I looked down at the ground, where I'd spat out the finger, and saw it beginning to rot. Within a minute it was nothing more than a grayish mound of mold.</p>","<p>\"Sorry if I frightened you,\"Cormac said, giving my head a pat.</p><p>\"That's okay,\"I told him. \"I should have learned by now to expect the unexpected around here. Can I feel the new finger?\"He nodded. It didn't feel different from any of the others. \"How do you do it?\"I asked, amazed. \"It is an illusion?\"</p><p>\"No illusion,\"he said. \"It's why they call me Cormac Limbs. I've been able to grow new limbs - fingers, toes, arms, legs - ever since I was a toddler. My parents discovered my talent when I had an accident with a kitchen knife and cut off part of my nose. I can grow back virtually any part of my body. Except my head. I haven't tried cutting that off. I guess it's best not to tempt fate.\"</p><p>\"Doesn't it hurt?\"I asked.</p><p>\"A little,\"he said, \"but not much. When one of my limbs gets cut off, a new one starts to grow almost immediately, so there's only a second or two of pain. It's a little like -\"</p><p>\"Come, come!\"Mr. Tall bellowed, cutting him short. \"We don't have time for detailed description. This show has been idle far too long. It's time we entertained the public again, before they forget about us or think we've retired.</p><p>\"People,\"he shouted to the crowd, and clapped his hands together. \"Spread the word. The lull is over. The show goes on tonight!\"</p><p>Chapter EIGHTEEN</p><p>The camp was buzzing with activity all afternoon. People were running around like crazy. A bunch of them were working on putting together the circus tent. I hadn't seen it before. It was an impressive sight when it was done, tall and round and red, decorated with pictures of the performers.</p><p>Evra and me were kept busy, hammering pegs into the ground to hold the tent in place, arranging seats inside, setting up the stage for the show, preparing props for the performers (we had to find tin cans and nuts and bolts for Rhamus Twobellies to eat, and help move the wolf-man's cage inside the tent, and so on).</p><p>It was a huge operation, but it moved with incredible speed. Everyone in the camp knew their place and what was expected of them, and there was never any real panic over the course of the day. Everybody worked as part of a team and things came together smoothly.</p><p>Sam showed up early in the afternoon. I would have kept him around to help with the work, but Evra said he'd be in the way, so we told him he had to take off. He was upset and slouched off, kicking an empty soda can along in front of him. I felt sorry for him, then realized how I could cheer him up.</p><p>\"Sam! Wait a minute!\"I shouted. \"I'll be back in a second,\"I told Evra, then rushed off to Mr. Tall's van.</p><p>I knocked once on the door and it opened instantly. Mr. Tall was standing inside, and before I could say a word, he held out two tickets for entry to the Cirque Du Freak.</p><p>I stared at the tickets, then at Mr. Tall. \"How did you know...?\"</p><p>\"I have my ways,\"he replied with a smile.</p><p>\"I don't have any money,\"I warned him.</p><p>\"I'll take it out of your wages,\"he said.</p><p>I frowned. \"You don't pay me anything.\"</p><p>His smile widened. \"Clever old me.\"He handed over the tickets and closed the door in my face before I could thank him.</p><p>I hurried back to Sam and gave him the tickets.</p><p>\"What are these?\"he asked.</p><p>\"Tickets for tonight's show,\"I told him. \"One for you and one for R.V.\"</p><p>\"Oh, wow!\"Sam quickly stuck the tickets in his pocket, as if he was afraid they might blow away or vanish. \"Thanks, Darren.\"</p><p>\"No problem,\"I said. \"The only thing is, it's a late show. We're starting at eleven, and it won't be over till nearly one in the morning. Will you be able to come?\"</p><p>\"Sure,\"Sam said. \"I'll sneak out. Mom and Dad go to bed at nine every night. They're early birds.\"</p><p>\"If you get caught,\"I warned him, \"don't tell them where you're going.\"</p><p>\"My lips are sealed,\"he promised, then set off to find R.V.</p><p>Except for a quick dinner, there was no other break between then and the start of the show. While Evra left to feed his snake, I set up candles inside the circus tent. There were also five huge chandeliers to be hung, four above the crowd and one over the stage, but the Little People took care of those.</p><p>Mags - a pretty woman who sold souvenirs and candy during intermission - asked me to help her get the displays ready, so I spent an hour stacking candy spiderwebs and edible ?glass? statues and pieces of the wolf-man's hair. There was a new novelty I hadn't seen before: a small model of Cormac Limbs. When you cut a part of it off, a new piece grew in its place. I asked Mags how it worked but she didn't know.</p><p>\"It's one of Mr. Tall's inventions,\"she said. \"He makes a lot of this stuff himself.\"</p><p>I chopped the head off the model and tried peering down the neck to see what was inside, but a new head grew before I could.</p><p>\"The models don't last forever,\"Mags said. \"They rot after a few months.\"</p><p>\"Do you tell people that when they're buying them?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Of course,\"she said. \"Mr. Tall insists we let the customers know exactly what they're buying. He doesn't approve of conning people.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley summoned me half an hour before the show began. He was dressing in his stage costume when I entered.</p><p>\"Polish Madam Octa's cage,\"he ordered, \"then brush your suit down and clean yourself up.\"</p><p>\"Why?\"I asked.</p><p>\"You are going on with me,\"he said.</p><p>My eyes lit up. \"You mean I'm part of the act?\"I gasped.</p><p>\"A small part,\"he said. \"You can bring the cage on and play the flute when it is Madam Octa's time to spin a web over my mouth.\"</p><p>\"Mr. Tall normally does that, doesn't he?\"</p><p>\"Normally,\"Mr. Crepsley agreed, \"but we are short on performers tonight, so he is going to be performing himself. Besides, you are better suited to assisting than him.\"</p><p>\"How so?\"I asked.</p><p>\"You look creepier,\"he said. \"With your pale face and that awful suit, you look like something out of a horror film.\"</p><p>That gave me a little bit of a shock. I'd never thought I was creepy looking! I looked in a mirror and realized I did look sort of frightening. Because I hadn't drank human blood, I was a lot paler than I should have been. The dirty suit made me look even more ghostlike. I made up my mind to find something new to wear in the morning.</p><p>The show started at exactly eleven. I didn't expect much of a crowd - we were in the middle of nowhere and hadn't had much time to notify people about the show - but the tent was packed.</p><p>\"Where did they all come from?\"I whispered to Evra as we watched Mr. Tall introduce the wolf-man.</p><p>\"Everywhere,\"he replied quietly. \"People always know when one of our shows is happening. Besides, even though he only told us about it today, Mr. Tall probably knew we'd be playing tonight ever since we set up camp.\"</p><p>I watched the show from the wings, enjoying it even more than the first time I'd seen it, because now I knew the people involved and felt like part of the family.</p><p>Hans Hands went on after the wolf-man, followed by Rhamus Twobellies. We had our first break, then Mr. Tall went onstage and darted around the place, never seeming to move, just vanishing from one spot and appearing somewhere new. Next up was Truska, then it was my turn to go onstage with Mr. Crepsley and Madam Octa.</p><p>The lights were low, but my vampire vision helped me pick out Sam's and R.V.'s faces in the crowd. They were surprised to see me and clapped louder than anybody else. I had to hide my excited smile: Mr. Crepsley had told me to look miserable and glum, to impress the crowd.</p><p>I stood over on one side as Mr. Crepsley made a speech about how deadly Madam Octa was, then opened the door to her cage as an assistant led a goat on the stage.</p><p>There was a loud, angry gasp when Madam Octa killed the goat... it came from R.V. I knew then that I shouldn't have invited him - I'd forgotten how fond he was of animals - but it was too late to take back my invitation.</p><p>I was pretty nervous when it was my turn to play the flute and control Madam Octa, feeling every set of eyes in the tent focus on me. I'd never performed for a crowd before and for a few seconds I was afraid my lips wouldn't work or I'd forget the tune. But once I started blowing and sending my thoughts to Madam Octa, I did okay.</p><p>As she weaved her web across Mr. Crepsley's lips, it struck me that I could get rid of him now if I wanted.</p><p>I could make her bite him.</p><p>The idea shocked me. I'd thought about killing him before, but never seriously, and not since we'd joined the Cirque. Now here he was, his life in my hands. All it would take was one \"slip.\"I could say it was an accident. Nobody would be able to prove otherwise.</p><p>I watched the spider move back and forth, up and down, her poisonous fangs glinting under the lights of the chandelier. The heat from the candles was intense. I was sweating a lot. It occurred to me that I could blame the slip of my fingers on the sweat.</p><p>Over his mouth she spun her web. His hands were down by his sides. He wouldn't be able to stop her. One wrong toot on the flute was all it would take. One broken note to stop the train of thought between the two of us, and...</p><p>I didn't do it. I played perfectly and safely. I wasn't sure why I spared the vampire. Maybe because Mr. Tall might know I'd killed him. Maybe because I needed Mr. Crepsley to teach me how to survive. Maybe because I didn't want to become a killer.</p><p>Or maybe, just maybe, because I was starting to like the vampire. After all, he'd brought me to the Cirque and made me part of his act. I wouldn't have met Evra and Sam if it hadn't been for him. He'd been kind to me, as kind as he could be.</p><p>Whatever the reason, I didn't let Madam Octa kill her master, and at the end of the act we took our bows and exited together.</p><p>\"You thought about killing me,\"Mr. Crepsley said softly once we were backstage.</p><p>\"What do you mean?\"I played dumb.</p><p>\"You know what I mean,\"he said. There was a pause. \"It would not have worked. I milked most of the poison from her fangs before we went on. Killing the goat took the rest out of her.\"</p><p>\"It was a test?\"I stared at him, and my hatred grew again. \"I thought you were being nice to me!\"I cried. \"And all the time it was just a test!\"</p><p>His face was serious. \"I had to know,\"he said. \"I had to know if I could rely on you.\"</p><p>\"Well, listen to this,\"I growled, standing on my toes so I could go eyeball to eyeball with him. \"Your test was useless. I didn't kill you this time, but if I ever get the chance again, I'll take it!\"</p><p>I stormed off without another word, too upset to stick around to see Cormac Limbs or the end of the show, feeling betrayed, even though deep down I knew what he said made sense.</p><p>Chapter NINETEEN</p><p>Iwas still upset the next morning. Evra kept asking me what was wrong, but I wouldn't tell him. I didn't want him to know I'd been thinking of killing Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>Evra told me he'd met Sam and R.V. after the show. \"Sam loved it,\"Evra said, \"especially Cormac Limbs. You should have stayed to see Cormac in action. When he sawed his legs off...\"</p><p>\"I'll see him next time,\"I said. \"How did R.V. take it?\"</p><p>Evra frowned. \"He wasn't happy.\"</p><p>\"Upset about the goat?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Yeah,\"Evra said, \"but not just that. I said we bought the goat from a butcher, so it would have been killed anyway. It was the wolf-man, the snake, and Mr. Crepsley's spider that bothered him the most.\"</p><p>\"What was wrong with them ?\"I asked.</p><p>\"He was afraid they weren't being treated right. He didn't like the idea of them being locked in cages. I told him they weren't, except for the spider. I said the wolf-man was really quiet offstage. And I showed him my snake and how she slept with me.\"</p><p>\"Did he believe you about the wolf-man?\"I asked.</p><p>\"I think so,\"Evra said, \"although he still seemed suspicious when they were leaving. And he was very interested in their eating habits. He wanted to know what we fed them, how often, and where we got the food. We have to be careful with R.V. He could cause problems. Luckily, he should be leaving in a day or two, but until then, beware.\"</p><p>The day went by quietly. Sam didn't show up until later on in the afternoon, and none of us was in the mood for playing. It was a cloudy day, and we were all a little out of sorts. Sam only stayed for half an hour, then went home again.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley summoned me to his van a little after sunset. I wasn't going to go, but decided it was best not to annoy him too much. He was my guardian, after all, and could probably have me booted out of the Cirque Du Freak.</p><p>\"What do you want?\"I snapped when I arrived.</p><p>\"Stand over here, where I can see you better,\"the vampire said.</p><p>He tilted my head backward with his bony fingers and rolled up my eyelids to check the whites of my eyes. He told me to open my mouth and peered down my throat. Then he checked my pulse and reflexes.</p><p>\"How do you feel?\"he asked.</p><p>\"Tired,\"I said.</p><p>\"Weak?\"he asked. \"Sick?\"</p><p>\"A bit.\"</p><p>He grunted. \"Have you been drinking much blood lately?\"he asked.</p><p>\"As much as I'm supposed to,\"I said.</p><p>\"But no human blood?\"</p><p>\"No,\"I said softly.</p><p>\"Okay,\"he said. \"Get ready. We are going out.\"</p><p>\"Hunting?\"I asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \"To see a friend.\"</p><p>I got up on his back outside the van, and he began running.</p><p>When we were far enough away from the camp, he flitted and the world blurred around us.</p>","<p>I didn't really pay attention to where we were going. I was more concerned with my suit. I'd forgotten to get new clothes, and now, the more I examined it, the worse the suit seemed.</p><p>There were dozens of small holes and rips, and the color was a lot grayer than it was supposed to be, because of the dirt and dust. Strands of thread and fibers had come loose, and every time I shook an arm or a leg I looked like I was shedding hairs.</p><p>I'd never been very worried about clothes, but I didn't want to look like a bum. Tomorrow I'd definitely find something new to wear.</p><p>After a while we approached a city and Mr. Crepsley slowed down. He stopped outside the back of a tall building. I wanted to ask where we were, but he put a finger to his lips and made the sign for silence.</p><p>The back door was locked but Mr. Crepsley laid a hand over it and clicked the fingers of his other hand. It opened instantly. He led the way through a long, dark corridor, then up a set of stairs and into a brightly lit hallway.</p><p>After a few minutes, we came to a white desk. Mr. Crepsley looked around to make sure we were alone, then rang the bell that hung from one of the walls.</p><p>A figure appeared behind the glass wall on the other side of the desk. The door in the glass wall opened and a brown-haired man in a white uniform and green mask stepped through. He looked like a doctor.</p><p>\"How may I -,\"he began, then stopped. \"Larten Crepsley! What are you doing here, you old devil?\"</p><p>The man pulled down his mask, and I saw he was grinning.</p><p>\"Hello, Jimmy,\"Mr. Crepsley said. The two shook hands and smiled at each other. \"Long time no see.\"</p><p>\"Not as long as I thought it would be,\"the man called Jimmy said. \"I heard you'd been killed. An old enemy finally rammed a stake through your rotten heart, or so the story went.\"</p><p>\"You should not believe everything you hear,\"Mr. Crepsley said. He put a hand on my shoulder and nudged me forward. \"Jimmy, this is Darren Shan, a traveling companion of mine. Darren, this is Jimmy Ovo, an old friend and the world's finest pathologist.\"</p><p>\"Hello,\"I said.</p><p>\"Pleased to meet you,\"Jimmy said, shaking my hand. \"You aren't a... I mean, do you belong to the club ?\"</p><p>\"He is a vampire,\"Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>\"Only half of me,\"I snapped. \"I'm not a full vampire.\"</p><p>\"Please,\"Jimmy winced. \"Don't use that word. I know what you guys are, and I'm fine with it, but that 'V' word never fails to freak me out.\"He shivered playfully. \"I think it's because of all the horror movies I watched when I was a kid. I know you're not like those movie monsters, but it's hard to get the image out of my mind.\"</p><p>\"What's a pathologist do?\"I asked.</p><p>\"I cut corpses open to see how they died,\"Jimmy explained. \"I don't do it with a lot of bodies - just the ones who died in suspicious circumstances.\"</p><p>\"This is a city morgue,\"Mr. Crepsley said. \"They store bodies that arrive dead at the hospital or die while they're there.\"</p><p>\"Is that where you keep them?\"I asked Jimmy, pointing at the room behind the glass wall.</p><p>\"Yup,\"he said cheerfully. He swung up a section of the desk and invited us through.</p><p>I was nervous. I expected to see dozens of tables piled high with sliced-open bodies. But it wasn't like that. There was one dead body, covered from head to toe with a long sheet, but that was the only one I could see. Otherwise it was a huge, well-lit room, with big filing cabinets built in the walls and lots of medical equipment scattered around the place.</p><p>\"How is business?\"Mr. Crepsley asked as we sat on three chairs near the corpse on the table. Jimmy and Mr. Crepsley didn't pay attention to the dead person, and since I didn't want to look out of place, neither did I.</p><p>\"Slow enough,\"Jimmy answered. \"The weather's been good, and there haven't been many car accidents. No strange diseases, no food epidemics, no collapsing buildings. By the way,\"he added, \"I had an old friend of yours in here a few years back.\"</p><p>\"Oh?\"Mr. Crepsley responded politely. \"Who was that?\"</p><p>Jimmy sniffed heavily through his nose, then cleared his throat.</p><p>\"Gavner Purl ?\"Mr. Crepsley hooted with delight. \"How is the old dog - as clumsy as ever?\"</p><p>They started talking about their friend Gavner Purl. I looked around while they were speaking, wondering where the bodies were kept. Finally, when they paused for breath, I asked Jimmy. He stood up, and told me to follow. He led the way to the big filing cabinets and pulled one of the drawers out.</p><p>There was a hissing sound, and a cloud of cold air rose from inside the drawer. When it cleared, I saw a sheet-covered form and realized the filing cabinets weren't filing cabinets at all. They were refrigerated coffins!</p><p>\"We store the bodies here until we're ready.\"</p><p>Jimmy said, \"or until their next of kin come to collect them.\"</p><p>I looked around the room, counting the rows of drawer doors. \"Is there a body behind each of these?\"I asked.</p><p>Jimmy shook his head. \"We've only got six guests right now, not counting the one on the table. Like I said, it's quiet. And even during our busiest times, most of our storage space goes unused. It's rare for us to be half full. We just like to be prepared for the worst.\"</p><p>\"Any fresh bodies in stock?\"Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"Wait a minute and I'll check,\"Jimmy said. He consulted a large pad and flicked through a few pages. \"There's a man in his thirties,\"Jimmy said. \"Died in a car crash just over eight hours ago.\"</p><p>\"Nothing fresher?\"Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"Afraid not,\"Jimmy replied.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley sighed. \"It will have to do.\"</p><p>\"Wait a minute,\"I said. \"You're not going to drink from a dead person, are you?\"</p><p>\"No,\"Mr. Crepsley said. He reached inside his cape and pulled out some of the small bottles where he stored his supply of human blood. \"I have come for a refill.\"</p><p>\"You can't!\"I yelled.</p><p>\"Why not?\"he asked.</p><p>\"It isn't right. It's not fair to drink from the dead. Besides, the blood will have turned sour.\"</p><p>\"It will not be at its best,\"Mr. Crepsley agreed, \"but it will do for bottling. And I disagree: A corpse is the ideal person to drain, since it has no use for the blood. It will take a lot to fill these bottles. Too much to take from a living person.\"</p><p>\"Not if you took a little from several,\"I protested.</p><p>\"True,\"he said. \"But that would require time, effort, and risk. It is easier this way.\"</p><p>\"Darren doesn't speak like a vampire,\"Jimmy remarked.</p><p>\"He is still learning.\"Mr. Crepsley grunted. \"Now, lead the way to the body, please. We have not got all night.\"</p><p>I knew it would be pointless to argue anymore, so I shut my mouth and followed silently behind them.</p><p>Jimmy slid out the body of a tall blond man and whipped back the sheet. There was a nasty bruise on the dead man's head and his body was really white, but otherwise he looked like he might be sleeping.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley made a long, deep cut across the man's chest, baring his heart. He arranged the bottles beside the corpse, then got out a tube and stuck one end into the first of the bottles. He stuck the other end into the dead man's heart, then wrapped his fist around the organ and squeezed it like a pump.</p><p>Blood crept slowly along the tube and into the bottle. When it was almost full, Mr. Crepsley pulled the tube out and jammed a cork into the neck of the bottle. He stuck the mouth of the tube into the second bottle and started filling that one.</p><p>Raising the first bottle, he swallowed a mouthful and rolled it around his gums, as though tasting wine. \"Good,\"he grunted, licking his lips. \"It is pure. We can use it.\"</p><p>He filled eight bottles, then turned to me with a serious look on his face.</p><p>\"Darren,\"he said, \"I know you are reluctant to drink human blood, but it is time you got over your fear.\"</p><p>\"No,\"I said immediately.</p><p>\"Come now, Darren,\"he growled. \"This person is dead. His blood is no good to him anymore.\"</p><p>\"I can't,\"I said. \"Not from a corpse.\"</p><p>\"But you will not drink from a live person!\"Mr. Crepsley exploded. \"You will have to drink human blood eventually. This is the best way to start.\"</p><p>\"Um, listen, guys,\"Jimmy said. \"If you're going to feed, I think I should get out of -\"</p><p>\"Quiet!\"Mr. Crepsley snapped. His eyes were burning into me. \"You have to drink,\"he said firmly. \"You are a vampire's assistant. It is time you behaved like one.\"</p><p>\"Not tonight,\"I begged. \"Another time. When we go hunting. From a living person. I can't drink from a corpse. It's disgusting.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley sighed and shook his head. \"One night you will realize how silly you are being,\"he said. \"I just hope, by that time, you are not beyond being saved.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley thanked Jimmy Ovo for his help, and the two started talking about the past and their friends. I sat by myself while they chatted, feeling miserable, wondering how long I could go without human blood.</p><p>When they were finished, we walked downstairs. Jimmy came with us and waved good-bye. He was a nice guy and I was sorry we'd had to meet under dark circumstances.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley didn't say anything the whole way home, and when we arrived back at the Cirque Du Freak, he tossed me angrily to one side and pointed a finger at me.</p><p>\"If you die,\"he said, \"it is not my fault.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\"I replied.</p><p>\"Stupid boy,\"he grumbled, then stormed off to his coffin.</p><p>I stayed up a while longer and watched the sun rising. I thought a lot about my situation and what would happen when my strength faded and I began to die. A half-vampire who wouldn't drink blood; it would have been funny if it wasn't so deadly.</p><p>What should I do? That was the question that kept me awake long after the sun rose. What should I do? Forget about it and just drink human blood? Or stay true to my humanity and... die ?</p><p>Chapter TWENTY</p><p>Istayed inside my tent most of the day and didn't even go out to say hi to Sam when he came around. I was so sad. I didn't feel like I belonged anywhere anymore. I couldn't be a human and wouldn't be a vampire. I was somewhere in between the two.</p><p>I got a lot of sleep that night, and the next day I felt better. The sun was shining, and although I knew my problems hadn't gone away, I was able to overlook them for a while.</p><p>Evra's snake was sick. She'd picked up a virus, and Evra had to stay in to look after her.</p><p>When Sam showed up, we decided to visit that old deserted railroad station of his. Evra didn't mind being left behind. He'd come with us another time.</p><p>The railroad station was cool. There was a huge circular yard paved with cracked stones, a three-story house that had served as the guard's house, a couple of old sheds, and several abandoned train cars. There were also railroad tracks running everywhere you looked, overgrown with weeds and grass.</p><p>Sam and I walked along some of the tracks and pretended we were on tightropes way above the ground. Every time one of us slipped, he had to scream and pretend to fall fatally to earth. I was much better at the game than Sam, because my vampire powers meant my sense of balance was better than any human's.</p><p>We explored a few of the old cars. A couple were run down, but most were okay. Pretty dusty and dirty, but otherwise in good condition. I couldn't understand why they'd been left there to rot.</p><p>We climbed onto the roof of one of the cars and stretched out to sit in the sun.</p><p>\"You know what we should do?\"Sam said after a while.</p><p>\"What?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Become blood brothers.\"</p><p>I propped myself up on an elbow and stared. \"Blood brothers?\"I asked. \"What for? And how's it done?\"</p><p>\"It'd be fun,\"he said. \"We each make a small cut on one of our hands, then join them together and swear an oath to be best friends forever.\"</p><p>\"That sounds all right,\"I agreed. \"Do you have a knife?\"</p><p>\"We can use some glass,\"Sam said. He slid over to the edge of the roof, reached down, and snapped a piece of glass out of one of the train-car windows. When he came back, he made a small cut in the fleshy part of his palm, then handed me the glass.</p><p>I was about to cut my palm when I remembered the vampire blood in my veins. I didn't think a small amount could do Sam any harm, but then again...</p><p>I lowered the glass and shook my head.</p><p>\"No,\"I said. \"I don't want to do it.\"</p><p>\"Come on,\"Sam urged. \"Don't be afraid. You only have to make a small cut.\"</p><p>\"No,\"I said again.</p><p>\"Coward!\"he yelled. \"You're afraid! Chicken! Coward!\"He began to sing: \"Fraidy cat, fraidy cat!\"</p><p>\"Okay, I'm a coward.\"I laughed. It was easier to lie than tell the truth. \"Everybody's afraid of something. I didn't see you rushing to wash the wolf-man the other day.\"</p><p>Sam made a face. \"That's different.\"</p><p>\"Horses for courses,\"I said smugly.</p><p>\"What does that mean?\"he asked.</p><p>\"I'm not sure,\"I admitted. \"It's something my dad used to say.\"</p><p>We joked around some more, then hopped down and crossed the yard to the guard's house. The doors had rotted off years ago, and most of the glass in the windows had fallen out. We walked through a couple of small rooms, then into a larger one, which had been the living room.</p><p>There was a huge hole in the middle of the floor, which we carefully avoided.</p><p>\"Look up,\"Sam told me.</p>","<p>I did and discovered I was gazing directly at the roof. The floors in between had fallen in over the years, and all that was left of them were jagged edges around the sides. I could see sunlight shining through a couple of holes in the roof.</p><p>\"Follow me,\"Sam said, and he led me to a staircase at the side of the room. He started up. I followed slowly, not sure if it was the smartest thing to do - the steps were creaky and looked as though they might collapse - but not wanting to be called a chicken twice in the same day.</p><p>We stopped at the third floor, where the stairs stopped. You could touch the roof from there, and we did.</p><p>\"Can we get out on the roof?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\"Sam said, \"but it's too dangerous. The shingles are loose. You could slide off. Anyway, there's something better up here than the roof.\"</p><p>He walked along the side of the uppermost room of the house. The ledge was about two feet wide most of the way, but I kept my back to the wall, not wanting to take any chances.</p><p>\"This section of floor won't collapse, will it?\"I asked nervously.</p><p>\"It never has before,\"Sam replied. \"But there's a first time for everything.\"</p><p>\"Thanks for putting my mind at ease,\"I grumbled.</p><p>Sam stopped a little farther on. I craned my neck so I could see past him and realized we had come to a set of rafters. There were six or seven of them, long pieces of wood stretching from one side of the room to the other.</p><p>\"This used to be the attic,\"Sam explained. \"I guessed that,\"I told him.</p><p>He looked back at me and grinned. \"But can you guess what we're going to do next?\"he asked.</p><p>I stared at him, then down at the rafters. \"You don't mean... You aren't going to... You're going to walk across, right?\"</p><p>\"Right,\"he said, and set his left foot on the rafter.</p><p>\"Sam, this isn't a good idea,\"I said. \"You looked unsteady on the railroad tracks. If you stumble up here...\"</p><p>\"I won't,\"he said. \"I was only fooling down there.\"</p><p>He set his other foot on the wooden rafter and began walking. He went slowly, his arms stretched out on either side. My heart was in my throat. I was certain he'd fall. I looked down and knew he wouldn't survive if he fell. There were four stories if you included the basement. It was a long drop. A deadly one.</p><p>But Sam made it across safely to the other side, where he turned and took a bow.</p><p>\"You're crazy!\"I yelled.</p><p>\"No,\"he said, \"just brave. How about you ? Dare to chance it? It'd be easier for you than it was for me.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Chickens have wings!\"he shouted.</p><p>That did it! I'd show him!</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I went across, moving quicker than Sam had, making full use of my vampire abilities. I didn't look down and tried not to think about what I was doing and in a couple of seconds I was across and standing beside Sam.</p><p>\"Wow!\"He was impressed. \"I didn't think you'd do it. Certainly not so quickly.\"</p><p>\"You don't travel with the Cirque without picking up a few tricks,\"I said, pleased with myself.</p><p>\"Do you think I could go that fast?\"Sam asked.</p><p>\"I wouldn't try it,\"I advised him.</p><p>\"I bet you can't do it again,\"he dared me.</p><p>\"Just watch,\"I said, and darted back across, even faster.</p><p>We spent a fun few minutes crossing over and back, taking each of the rafters in turn. Then we crossed at the same time, on different rafters, yelling and laughing at each other.</p><p>Sam stopped in the middle of his rafter and turned to face me.</p><p>\"Hey!\"he shouted. \"Let's play mirrors.\"</p><p>\"What's that?\"I asked.</p><p>\"I do something and you have to copy me.\"He shook his left hand above his head. \"Like this.\"</p><p>\"Oh,\"I said, and shook my hand. \"Okay. As long as you don't jump to your death. That's the one thing I won't copy.\"</p><p>He laughed, then made a face. I made one, too. Then he slowly stood on one leg. I did the same. Next he bent and touched his toes. I followed his example. I couldn't wait until it was my turn. I'd do a few things - like jump from one rafter to the next - that there was no way he could copy. For once, I was glad for my vampire blood.</p><p>Of course, that was the moment when it went and let me down...</p><p>There was no warning. One second I was beginning to stand, having bent to touch my toes. The next my head was spinning, my arms were flapping, and my legs were shaking.</p><p>This wasn't my first dizzy spell - I'd had several recently - but I hadn't taken much notice before - I'd just sat down and waited for the dizziness to pass. This time was different. I was four stories up. There was nowhere to sit.</p><p>I tried lowering myself, thinking I could cling to the rafter and crawl to safety. But before I could get low enough, my feet slipped out from under me... and I fell!</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-ONE</p><p>Although my vampire blood was responsible for getting me into the mess on the rafters, it also saved my life.</p><p>As I fell, I stuck out an arm - more out of desperation than anything else - and my hand caught the rafter. If I'd been an ordinary human boy, I wouldn't have had the strength to hold on. But I wasn't ordinary. I was a half-vampire. And even though I was dizzy, I was able to grab tight and hold on.</p><p>I swung above the four-story drop, eyes shut, hanging on by those four slim fingers and my thumb.</p><p>\"Darren! Hang on!\"Sam shouted. He didn't need to tell me that - I was hardly going to let go.</p><p>I'm coming over,\"Sam said. \"I'll be there as fast as I can. Don't let go. And don't panic.\"</p><p>He went on talking as he made his way across, calming me down, telling me it would be all right, he'd rescue me, I had to relax, everything was fine.</p><p>His words helped. They gave me something other than the drop to think about. If not for Sam, I would have been a goner.</p><p>I felt him inch out along my rafter. The wood creaked, and for one awful moment I thought the weight would cause it to break and send both of us plummeting to our deaths. But it held and he closed the gap, crawling along on his stomach, quickly but carefully.</p><p>Sam paused when he reached me.</p><p>\"Now,\"he said, \"I'm going to grab your wrist with my right hand. I'll do it slowly. Don't move while I'm doing it, and don't grab me with your free hand. Okay?\"</p><p>\"Okay,\"I said.</p><p>I felt his hand close over my wrist.</p><p>\"Don't let go of the rafter,\"he said.</p><p>\"I won't,\"I promised.</p><p>\"I don't have the strength to pull you up,\"he told me, \"so I'm going to swing you from one side to the other. Stretch your free arm out. When you can, grab for the rafter. If you miss, don't panic, I'll still be holding on. If you get a grip, stay still for a few seconds and give your body a chance to relax. Then we can haul you up. Got it?\"</p><p>\"Got it, captain,\"I said, grinning nervously.</p><p>\"Here goes. And remember: Everything will be all right. Okay. It's going to work. You will survive.\"</p><p>He began swinging me, lightly at first, then a little harder. I was tempted to grab at the rafter after a few swings but forced myself to wait. When I thought I was swinging high enough, I stretched out my fingers, concentrated on the thin plank of wood, and grabbed.</p><p>I caught it!</p><p>I was able to relax a little then and rest the muscles of my right arm.</p><p>\"Do you feel ready to pull yourself up?\"Sam asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\"I said.</p><p>\"I'll help you get your upper body up,\"he said. \"When your stomach is safe across the rafter, I'll get out of the way and give you room to bring your legs up.\"</p><p>Sam put his right hand on the collar of my shirt and jacket - to catch me if I slipped - and helped yank me upward.</p><p>I scraped my chest and stomach on the rafter, but the pain didn't bother me. In fact, I welcomed it: It meant I was alive.</p><p>When I was safe, Sam backed off and I got my legs up. I crawled after him, moving slower than necessary. When I reached the ledge, I stayed crouched down and didn't stand until we got to the stairs. Then I leaned against the wall and let out a long, shuddering sigh of relief.</p><p>\"Wow,\"Sam said to the left of me. \"That was fun ! Do you want to do it again?\"</p><p>I think he was joking.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-TWO</p><p>Later, after I'd stumbled down the stairs - my sense of balance was still off, but getting better - we walked back to the train cars and rested in the shadow of one.</p><p>\"You saved my life,\"I said softly.</p><p>\"It was nothing,\"Sam said. \"You would have done the same for me.\"</p><p>\"Probably,\"I said. \"But I wasn't called upon to help. I wasn't the one who had to use his head and act cool. You saved me, Sam. I owe you my life.\"</p><p>\"Keep it.\"He laughed. \"What would I do with it?\"</p><p>\"I'm serious, Sam. I owe you big-time. Anything you ever want or need, just ask, and I'll do anything to get it for you.\"</p><p>\"You mean that?\"</p><p>\"Cross my heart,\"I swore.</p><p>\"There is one thing,\"he said.</p><p>\"Name it.\"</p><p>\"I want to join the Cirque Du Freak.\"</p><p>\"Saaaammmm...\"I groaned.</p><p>\"You asked what I wanted, so I'm telling you,\"he replied.</p><p>\"It's not that easy,\"I protested.</p><p>\"Yes it is,\"he said. \"You can talk to the owner and put in a good word for me. Come on, Darren, did you mean what you said or not?\"</p><p>\"All right.\"I sighed. \"I'll ask Mr. Tall.\"</p><p>\"When?\"</p><p>\"Today,\"I promised. \"As soon as I get back.\"</p><p>\"All right!\"Sam tried to high-five me.</p><p>\"But if he says no,\"I warned him, \"that's the end of it, okay? I'll do what I can, but if Mr. Tall says no, that means no.\"</p><p>\"Sure,\"Sam said. \"That's fine by me.\"</p><p>\"Maybe there's a job for me, too,\"somebody said behind my back.</p><p>I spun around quickly, and there was R.V., smiling strangely.</p><p>\"You shouldn't creep up on people like that,\"I snapped. \"You scared me.\"</p><p>\"Sorry, man,\"R.V. said, but he didn't look very sorry.</p><p>\"What are you doing out here?\"Sam asked.</p><p>\"I wanted to find Darren,\"R.V. said. \"I never got a chance to thank him for my ticket.\"</p><p>\"That's okay,\"I said. \"I'm sorry I wasn't around to see you when it was over, but I had to go somewhere else.\"</p><p>\"Sure,\"R.V. said, sitting down on the track beside me. \"I can understand that. A show that size, there must be lots to do, huh? I bet they keep you real busy, right, man?\"</p><p>\"Right,\"I said.</p><p>R.V. grinned, and stared at the two of us. There was something about the way he was smiling that made me uneasy. It wasn't a nice smile.</p><p>\"Tell me,\"R.V. said, \"how's the wolf-man doing?\"</p><p>\"He's fine,\"I said.</p><p>\"He's chained up all the time, isn't he?\"R.V. asked.</p><p>\"No,\"I said, remembering Evra's warning.</p><p>\"He's not?\"R.V. acted surprised. \"A wild beast like him, savage and dangerous, and he isn't locked up?\"</p><p>\"He's not really dangerous,\"I said. \"That's an act. He's pretty tame, actually.\"I could see Sam staring at me. He knew how wild the wolf-man was and didn't get why I was lying.</p><p>\"Tell me, man, what does a thing like that eat?\"R.V. asked.</p><p>\"Steak. Pork chops. Sausages.\"I forced a smile. \"The usual stuff. All store-bought.\"</p><p>\"Really? What about the goat that spider bit? Who eats that?\"</p><p>\"I don't know.\"</p><p>\"Evra said the two of you bought the goat from a local farmer. Did it cost much?\"</p><p>\"Not really,\"I said. \"It was pretty sick, so it -\"</p><p>I stopped. Evra had told R.V. we bought the goat from a butcher , not a farmer.</p><p>\"I've been doing a little investigating, man,\"R.V. said softly. \"Everybody else in my camp has been getting ready to move on, but I've been walking around, counting sheep and cows, asking questions, digging for bones.</p><p>\"Animals have been vanishing,\"R.V. continued. \"The farmers aren't taking much notice - they don't mind the odd one or two missing - but it intrigues me. Who do you think could be taking them, man?\"</p><p>I didn't answer.</p><p>\"Another thing,\"he said. \"I was walking along the river you're camped by, and do you know what I found downstream? Lots of small bones and scraps of skin and meat. Where do you think they could have come from, Darren?\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\"I said. Then I stood up. \"I gotta go now. They need me back at the Cirque. Jobs to do.\"</p><p>\"Don't let me keep you,\"R.V. said with a smile.</p><p>\"When is your group headed out?\"I asked. \"I might stop by to say good-bye before you leave.\"</p><p>\"That's nice of you,\"R.V. said. \"But don't worry, man. I won't be going anywhere soon.\"</p><p>I frowned. \"I thought you said you were moving on.\"</p><p>\"NOP is moving on,\"he said. \"In fact, they've already moved. They pulled out yesterday evening.\"He smiled icily. \"But I'm staying a little longer. There are a few things I want to check out.\"</p><p>\"Oh.\"Inside my head I swore loudly, but outside I pretended to be happy. \"That's good news. Well, see you around.\"</p><p>\"Oh, yeah,\"R.V. said. \"You'll see me around, man. You can bet on that. You'll be seeing plenty of me.\"</p>","<p>I grinned awkwardly.</p><p>\"So long for now,\"I said.</p><p>\"So long,\"R.V. replied.</p><p>\"Wait up,\"Sam called. \"I'll come with you.\"</p><p>\"No,\"I said. \"Come tomorrow. I'll have an answer from Mr. Tall for you by then. Bye.\"</p><p>I took off before either of them could say anything else.</p><p>R.V.'s interest in the disappearance of the animals worried me at first, but as I walked back to camp I began to relax. When all was said and done, he was only a hairy harmless human, while those of us in the Cirque Du Freak were strange, powerful beings. What could he possibly do to hurt us?</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-THREE</p><p>Imeant to report right to Mr. Tall when I got back, to tell him about R.V., but as I was heading for his van, Truska - the lady who was able to grow an incredible beard - grabbed my arm and made signs that she wanted me to follow her.</p><p>She led me to her tent. It was decorated more than most of the other tents and vans. The walls were covered with mirrors and paintings. There were huge wardrobes and dressing tables and a humongous four-poster bed.</p><p>Truska said something in her weird seal-like voice, then stood me in the center of the room and made a sign that I wasn't supposed to move. She grabbed a measuring tape and measured my body.</p><p>When she finished, she pursed her lips and thought for a few seconds, then clicked her fingers and hurried to one of the closets. She dug through it, coming out with a pair of pants. She found a shirt in another closet, a jacket in another, and a pair of shoes in a large chest. She let me pick my own T-shirt, underwear, and socks from one of the dressing-table drawers.</p><p>I stepped behind a silk screen to put the clothes on. Evra must have told her about my wish to find new clothes. I'm glad that he did, because I probably would have kept on forgetting.</p><p>Truska clapped her hands when I came out and quickly shoved me in front of a mirror. The clothes fit perfectly and, much to my surprise, I looked supercool! The shirt was light green, the pants were dark purple, and the jacket was blue and gold. Truska found a long piece of red satin cloth and wrapped it around my waist like a belt. That completed the picture: I looked just like a pirate!</p><p>\"This is great!\"I told her. \"The only thing is,\"I said, pointing at my feet, \"the shoes are a little tight.\"</p><p>Truska took back the shoes and found a new pair. They were roomier than the first pair and the toes curled up just like Sinbad the Sailor's. They were really cool.</p><p>\"Thanks, Truska,\"I said, and started to leave. She raised a hand and I stopped. She pulled a chair over to one of the taller wardrobes and stood on it, reached up, and brought down a huge round box. She plopped it on the floor, opened it, and pulled out a small brown hat with a feather in it, the kind that Robin Hood wore.</p><p>Before I could put the hat on, she made me sit down, got a pair of scissors, and gave me a haircut, which I badly needed.</p><p>The haircut and hat were the icing on the cake. I almost didn't recognize myself in the mirror when I looked this time.</p><p>\"Oh, Truska,\"I said. \"I... I...\"I couldn't find the words, so instead I threw my arms around her and gave her a big, sloppy kiss. I felt embarrassed when I let go, and was glad none of my friends had been around to see, but Truska was beaming.</p><p>I rushed off to show Evra my new look. He thought the clothes were great, but swore he'd never asked Truska to help me. He said she must have either been sick of seeing me look so scruffy, or Mr. Crepsley had asked her to fix me up, or she'd done it because she liked me.</p><p>\"She does not like me!\"I shouted.</p><p>\"Truska loves Darren,\"he sang. \"Truska loves Darren.\"</p><p>\"Oh, shut up, you slimy excuse for a reptile,\"I growled.</p><p>He laughed, not the least bit offended.</p><p>\"Darren and Truska sitting in a tree,\"he sang, \"k-i-s-s-i-n-g. First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes Darren with the vampire carriage.\"</p><p>I jumped on him, wrestled him to the ground, and wouldn't let go until he cried for mercy.</p><p>When we were finished. Evra went back to taking care of his snake, and I went outside and continued with the day's jobs. I was on the go nonstop, because I had to cover for Evra and do the work of two. With all that coming and going, and the excitement of having new clothes, I totally forgot about R.V. and telling Mr. Tall about the ecowarrior's threat to investigate the disappearing animals.</p><p>If I hadn't been so forgetful, maybe things would have turned out differently, and maybe our stay wouldn't have ended in a bloodbath.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>Iwas ready to collapse by the time night came. The activity had worn me out. Evra had warned me not to sleep in his tent that night; his snake was in a foul mood because of the virus and might bite. So I headed for Mr. Crepsley's van and made a bed on the floor beside Madam Octa's cage.</p><p>I fell asleep within a couple of minutes of lying down.</p><p>A little later, as I was dreaming, something caught in my throat and made me gag. I coughed and awoke.</p><p>There was a figure above me, holding a small bottle to my mouth, trying to force a liquid down me. My first strange, terrified thought was: \"It's Mr. Tiny!\"</p><p>I bit the top off the bottle, cutting my lips and spilling most of the liquid. The man swore, grabbed my chin, and pried my gums apart. He tried pouring the last of the liquid into my open mouth, but I spat it out.</p><p>The man swore again, then let go and slumped back. As my heartbeat slowed, I saw that it wasn't Mr. Tiny.</p><p>It was Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>\"What the hell were you trying to do?\"I screamed angrily. I was too mad to feel the pain in my cut lips.</p><p>He showed me the remains of the small bottle... one of the containers he used to store human blood.</p><p>\"You were trying to get me to drink!\"I screamed.</p><p>\"You have to,\"Mr. Crepsley said. \"You are wasting away, Darren. If you go on like this, you will be dead within a week. If you do not have the courage to drink, it must be forced into you.\"</p><p>I stared at him savagely. He looked uncomfortable and turned his eyes away from mine.</p><p>\"I was trying to help,\"he said.</p><p>\"If you ever try that again,\"I said slowly, \"I'll kill you. I'll wait until day, then creep in and chop your head off.\"</p><p>He could tell I was serious, because he nodded glumly.</p><p>\"Never again,\"he agreed. \"I knew it would not work, but I had to try. If you had swallowed even a little, it would have kept you going a while longer, and once you had the taste, you might not be so afraid to drink again.\"</p><p>\"I'll never have the taste!\"I roared. \"I won't drink human blood. I don't care if I do die. I won't drink it.\"</p><p>\"Very well.\"He sighed. \"I have done my best. If you insist on being stupid, on your own head be it.\"</p><p>\"I'm not being stupid... I'm being human ,\"I growled.</p><p>\"But you are not human,\"he said softly.</p><p>\"I know,\"I replied. \"But I want to be. I want to be like Sam. I want a family and ordinary friends. I want to grow old at the usual rate. I don't want to spend my life drinking blood and feeding off humans, worrying about sunlight and vampire hunters.\"</p><p>\"Too bad,\"Mr. Crepsley said. \"It is the hand you have been dealt.\"</p><p>\"I hate you,\"I snarled.</p><p>\"Too bad,\"he said again. \"You are stuck with me. If it is any compensation,\"he added, \"I am none too fond of you, either. Turning you into a half-vampire was the worst mistake I ever made.\"</p><p>\"So why not free me?\"I wailed.</p><p>\"I cannot,\"he said. \"I would if I could. Of course, you are free to leave any time you like.\"</p><p>I stared at him suspiciously. \"Really?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Really,\"he said. \"I do not mind. In fact, I would prefer it if you did. That way, you would no longer be my responsibility. I would not have to watch you die.\"</p><p>I shook my head slowly. \"I don't understand you at all,\"I said.</p><p>He smiled, almost tenderly. \"Nor I you,\"he said.</p><p>We laughed a little then, and things returned to normal. I didn't like what Mr. Crepsley had tried, but understood why he'd tried it. You can't really hate someone who has your best interests at heart.</p><p>I told him what I'd done that day, about going to the railroad yard with Sam and how he saved my life. I also told him about almost becoming Sam's blood brother.</p><p>\"It is a good thing you stopped when you did,\"Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>\"What would have happened if I hadn't?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Your blood would have tainted his. He would have developed a taste for raw meat. He would have hung around butcher shops, staring in the windows. He would have aged at a slightly slower rate than normal. It would not have been much of a difference, but it would have been enough.\"</p><p>\"Enough to do what?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Drive him mad,\"Mr. Crepsley said. \"He would not have understood what was happening. He would have thought he was evil. He would not have known why his life had changed. Within ten years he would have been a screaming wreck.\"</p><p>I shivered at the thought of how close I'd come to destroying Sam's life. This sort of thing was precisely why I had to stay with Mr. Crepsley until I'd learned everything about being a half-vampire.</p><p>\"What do you think of Sam?\"I asked.</p><p>\"I have not seen much of him,\"Mr. Crepsley said. \"He comes mostly by day. But he seems nice. Very bright.\"</p><p>\"He's been helping Evra and me with our chores,\"I said.</p><p>\"I know.\"</p><p>\"He's a good worker.\"</p><p>\"So I have heard.\"</p><p>I licked my lips nervously. \"He wants to join the Cirque,\"I said. Mr. Crepsley's face darkened. \"I was going to ask Mr. Tall, but I forgot. I'll ask tomorrow. What do you think he'll say?\"</p><p>\"He will say you have to ask me. Children cannot join the Cirque Du Freak unless an independent member agrees to be their guardian.</p><p>\"I could be his guardian,\"I said.</p><p>\"You are not old enough. It would have to be me. I would have to give my permission. But I will not.\"</p><p>\"Why?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Because it is a crazy idea,\"he said. \"One child is bad enough. There is no way I would take on a second. Besides, he is human. I am stuck with you because of the vampire blood in your veins. Why should I put my neck on the line for a human?\"</p><p>\"He's my friend,\"I said. \"He'd be company for me.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley snorted. \"Madam Octa is company enough.\"</p><p>\"That's not the same,\"I whined.</p><p>\"Tell me this,\"Mr. Crepsley mused. \"What happens when he finds out you are a vampire? You think he will understand? You think he will sleep easily, knowing his best friend would like nothing better than to slit his throat open and drink him dry?\"</p><p>\"I wouldn't do that!\"I yelled.</p><p>\"I know,\"Mr. Crepsley agreed. \"But I am a vampire. I know what you are really like. So do Mr. Tall, Evra, and the others. But how do you think an ordinary human would see you?\"</p><p>I sighed unhappily. \"You won't let him join?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley began to shake his head, then stopped and nodded slowly. \"Very well,\"he said. \"He can join.\"</p><p>\"He can ?\"I stared at him, shocked. Even though I'd been arguing on Sam's behalf, I'd never really thought they would let him join.</p><p>\"Yes,\"Mr. Crepsley said. \"He can join and travel with us and help you and Evra with your jobs. But on one condition.\"Mr. Crepsley leaned in close to me and grinned wickedly. \"He has to become a half-vampire, too !\"he hissed.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>My heart was heavy when I saw Sam run into camp early the next morning. I hated having to disappoint him but knew I had to. There was no way I could let Mr. Crepsley turn Sam into a half-vampire.</p><p>I'd thought about it a lot during the night, and the frightening thing was, I believed Sam would agree to become a half-vampire if I gave him the option. Smart as he was, I don't think he'd have stopped to consider the loneliness and awfulness of being a vampire.</p><p>He rushed over when he saw me, too excited to notice my new clothes and haircut.</p><p>\"Did you ask him? Did you?\"His face was bright, filled with hope.</p><p>\"Yes,\"I said, smiling sadly.</p><p>\"And?\"</p><p>I shook my head. \"Sorry, Sam. He said no.\"</p><p>Sam's face fell about a thousand miles.</p><p>\"Why ?\"he shouted.</p><p>\"You're too young,\"I said.</p><p>\"You're not much older!\"he snapped.</p><p>\"But I don't have parents,\"I lied. \"I didn't have a home when I joined the Cirque.\"</p><p>\"I don't care about my parents,\"he said with a sniff.</p><p>\"That's not true,\"I said. \"You'd miss them.\"</p><p>\"I could go home for holidays.\"</p><p>\"It wouldn't work. You're not cut out for life in the Cirque Du Freak. Maybe later, when you're older.\"</p><p>\"I don't care about later !\"he yelled. \"I want to join now. I've worked hard. I've proved myself. I kept quiet when you were lying to R.V. about the wolf-man yesterday. Did you tell that to Mr. Tall?\"</p><p>\"I told him everything,\"I said.</p><p>\"I don't believe you,\"Sam said. \"I don't think you spoke to him at all. I want to see him myself.\"</p><p>I shrugged and pointed toward Mr. Tall's van. \"That's where you'll find him,\"I said.</p><p>Sam ran off in a huff but slowed after a few steps, then came to a halt. He kicked the ground miserably, then returned and sat down beside me.</p><p>\"It's not fair,\"he grumbled. I could see tears trickling down his cheeks. \"I made up my mind to join. It was going to be great. I had it all planned.\"</p>","<p>\"There'll be other chances,\"I said.</p><p>\"When?\"he asked. \"I've never heard of a freak show playing around here before. When will I run into one again?\"</p><p>I didn't answer.</p><p>\"You wouldn't have liked it, anyway,\"I said. \"It's not as much fun as you think. Imagine what it's like in the middle of winter, when you have to get up at five in the morning and shower in ice-cold water and work outside in blizzards.\"</p><p>\"That doesn't bother me,\"Sam insisted. Then his tears stopped and he got a crafty look in his eyes. \"Maybe I'll come along, anyway,\"he said. \"Maybe I'll sneak into one of the vans and stow away with you. Mr. Tall would have to take me then.\"</p><p>\"You can't do that!\"I snapped. \"No way!\"</p><p>\"I will if I want.\"He grinned. \"You can't stop me.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I can,\"I growled.</p><p>\"How?\"He sneered.</p><p>I took a deep breath. The time had come to scare Sam Grest away forever. I couldn't tell him the truth about me, but I could invent a story almost as horrifying, one guaranteed to send him running.</p><p>\"I never told you what happened to my parents, did I, Sam? Or how I came to join the freak show?\"I kept my voice low and steady.</p><p>\"No,\"Sam said quietly. \"I've wondered a lot, but I didn't want to ask.\"</p><p>\"I killed them, Sam,\"I said.</p><p>\"What ?\"His face went white.</p><p>\"I go crazy sometimes. Like the wolf-man. Nobody knows when it's going to happen, or why. I was in a hospital when I was younger, but I seemed to be getting better. My parents brought me home for Christmas. After dinner, while I was in a fight with Dad, I flipped out.</p><p>\"I tore him to pieces. Mom tried to drag me off, but I killed her too. My little sister ran for help, but I caught her. I ripped her apart the same way I'd ripped my mother and father.</p><p>\"Then, after I'd killed them...\"I locked eyes with Sam. It had to be a good act to make him believe. \"I ate them.\"</p><p>He stared at me, stunned.</p><p>\"That's not true,\"he whispered. \"It can't be.\"</p><p>\"I killed and ate them, then ran away,\"I lied. \"I was discovered by Mr. Tall, who agreed to hide me. They have a special cage built to keep me in when I go crazy. The problem is, nobody knows when it's going to happen. That's why most people avoid me. Evra's okay, because he's strong. So are some of the other performers. But ordinary humans... I could rip them apart in a second.\"</p><p>\"You're lying,\"Sam said.</p><p>I picked up a large stick lying nearby, turned it around in my hands, then put it in my mouth and bit through it like it was a big carrot.</p><p>\"I'd chew your bones and spit you out as gristle,\"I told Sam. I'd cut my lips on the stick and the blood made me look ferocious. \"You wouldn't be able to stop me. You'd be sleeping in my tent if you joined the show and would be the one I'd go for first.</p><p>\"You can't join the Cirque Du Freak,\"I said. \"I wish you could - I'd love to have a friend - but it's not possible. I'd end up killing you if you joined.\"</p><p>Sam tried responding but couldn't get his mouth to work. He believed my big lie. He'd seen enough of the show to know that things like that could happen here.</p><p>\"Go away, Sam,\"I said sadly. \"Go away and don't ever come back. It's safer that way. It's better. For both of us.\"</p><p>\"Darren, I... I...\"He shook his head uncertainly.</p><p>\"Go !\"I roared, and pounded the ground with my hands. I bared my teeth and growled. I was able to make my voice much deeper than a human's, so it sounded like a wild animal.</p><p>Sam screamed, scrambled to his feet, and sprinted for the woods, never once looking back.</p><p>I watched him go, heavyhearted, certain my ploy had worked. He'd never be back. I wouldn't see him again. Our paths had separated, and we would never meet again.</p><p>If I'd known how wrong I was - if I'd had any idea of the awful night that lay ahead - I'd have run after him and never returned to that disgusting circus of blood, that revolting circus of death.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-SIX</p><p>Iwas moping around when one of the Little People tapped me on the back. It was the one with the limp.</p><p>\"What do you want?\"I asked.</p><p>The tiny man - if it was a man - in the blue-hooded robe rubbed his stomach with his hands. This was the sign that he and his brothers were hungry.</p><p>\"You just had breakfast,\"I said.</p><p>He rubbed his stomach again.</p><p>\"It's too early for lunch.\"</p><p>He rubbed his stomach again.</p><p>I knew that this would go on for hours if I let it. He would patiently follow me around, rubbing his stomach, until I agreed to go hunt for food for him.</p><p>\"All right,\"I snapped. \"I'll see what I can find. But I'm on my own today, so if I don't come back with a full bag, tough.\"</p><p>He rubbed his stomach again.</p><p>I spit on the ground and took off.</p><p>I shouldn't have gone hunting. I was really weak. I could still run faster than a human, and I was stronger than most kids my age, but I wasn't superfit or extrastrong anymore. Mr. Crepsley had said I'd be dead within a week if I didn't drink human blood, and I knew he'd spoken the truth. I could feel myself wasting away. A few more days and I wouldn't be able to pull myself out of bed.</p><p>I tried catching a rabbit but wasn't fast enough. I worked up a sweat chasing it and had to sit down for a few minutes. Next, I went looking for roadkill but couldn't find any dead animals. Finally, because I was tired and half afraid of what would happen if I returned to camp empty-handed (the Little People might decide to eat me!) , I headed for a field full of sheep.</p><p>They were grazing peacefully when I arrived. They were used to humans and barely lifted their heads when I entered the field and walked among them.</p><p>I was looking for an old sheep, or one that looked sick. That way I wouldn't have to feel so lousy about killing it. I finally found one with skinny, trembling legs and a dazed expression, and decided she'd do. She looked as though she didn't have long to live, anyway.</p><p>If I'd had my full powers, I would have snapped her neck and she would have been dead in an instant, without any pain. But I was weak and clumsy and didn't twist hard enough the first time.</p><p>The sheep began to bleat with agony.</p><p>She tried running away, but her legs wouldn't carry her. She fell to the ground, where she lay bleating miserably.</p><p>I tried breaking her neck again but couldn't. In the end I grabbed a stone and finished the job. It was a messy, horrible way to kill an animal, and I felt ashamed of myself as I grabbed its back legs and hauled it away from the flock.</p><p>I'd almost reached the fence before I realized somebody was sitting on top of it, waiting for me. I dropped the sheep and looked up, expecting an angry farmer.</p><p>But it wasn't a farmer.</p><p>It was R.V.</p><p>And he was mad as hell.</p><p>\"How could you?\"he shouted. \"How could you kill a poor, innocent animal so cruelly?\"</p><p>\"I tried killing her quickly,\"I said. \"I tried snapping her neck, but I couldn't. I was going to leave her when I couldn't do it, but she was in pain. I thought it was better to finish her off than leave her to suffer.\"</p><p>\"That's real big of you, man,\"he said sarcastically.</p><p>\"Do you think you'll get the Nobel Peace Prize for that?\"</p><p>\"Come on, R.V.,\"I said. \"Don't be angry. She was sick. The farmer would have killed her anyway. Even if she'd lived she would have been sent to a butcher in the end.\"</p><p>\"That don't make it right,\"he said angrily. \"Just because other people are nasty, it don't mean you should be nasty, too.\"</p><p>\"Killing animals isn't nasty,\"I said. \"Not when it's for food.\"</p><p>\"What's wrong with vegetables?\"he asked. \"We don't need to eat meat, man. We don't need to kill.\"</p><p>\"Some people need meat,\"I disagreed. \"Some can't live without it.\"</p><p>\"Then they should be left to die!\"R.V. roared. \"That sheep never did any harm to anyone. As far as I'm concerned, killing her is worse than killing a human. You're a murderer, Darren Shan.\"</p><p>I shook my head sadly. There was no point arguing with somebody this stubborn.</p><p>\"Look, R.V.,\"I said. \"I don't enjoy killing. I'd be psyched if every person in the world was a vegetarian. But they're not. People eat meat, and that's a fact of life. I'm only doing what I have to.\"</p><p>\"Well, we'll see what the police have to say about it,\"R.V. said.</p><p>\"The police?\"I frowned. \"What do they have to do with it?\"</p><p>\"You've killed somebody else's sheep.\"He laughed cruelly. \"Do you think they'll let you get away with that? They won't arrest you for murdering rabbits and foxes, but they'll charge you for killing a sheep. I'll have the police and health inspectors come down on you like a ton of bricks.\"He grinned.</p><p>\"You won't!\"I gasped. \"You don't like the police. You're always fighting against them.\"</p><p>\"When I have to,\"he agreed. \"But when I can get them on my side...\"He laughed again. \"They'll arrest you first, then turn your camp upside down. I've been studying the goings-on there. I've seen the way you treat that poor hairy man.\"</p><p>\"The wolf-man?\"</p><p>\"Yeah. You keep him locked away like an animal.\"</p><p>\"He is an animal,\"I said.</p><p>\"No,\"R.V. disagreed. \"You are the animal, man.\"</p><p>\"R.V., listen,\"I said. \"We don't have to be enemies. Come back to camp with me. Talk to Mr. Tall and the others. See how we live. Get to know and understand us. There's no need to -\"</p><p>\"Save it,\"he snapped. I'm getting the police. Nothing you can say will stop me.\"</p><p>I took a deep breath. I liked R.V. but knew I couldn't allow him to destroy the Cirque Du Freak.</p><p>\"All right, then,\"I said. \"If nothing I say can stop you, maybe you'll respond to something I do.\"</p><p>Summoning all my remaining strength, I threw the dead body of the sheep at R.V. It struck him in the chest and knocked him flying from the fence. He yelled with surprise, then with pain as he landed heavily on the ground.</p><p>I leaped over the fence and was on him before he could move.</p><p>\"How did you do that, man?\"he whispered.</p><p>\"Never mind,\"I snapped.</p><p>\"Kids can't throw sheep,\"he said. \"How did -\"</p><p>\"Shut up!\"I shouted, and slapped his bearded face. He stared up at me, shocked. \"Listen, Reggie Veggie,\"I growled, using the name he hated, \"and listen good. You won't go to the police or the health inspectors. Because if you do, the sheep won't be the only dead body I drag back to the Cirque Du Freak today.\"</p><p>\"What are you?\"he asked. His voice was trembling, and his eyes were filled with terror.</p><p>\"I'm the end of you if you screw with me,\"I swore.</p><p>I dug my fingernails into the soil at either side of his face and squeezed his head between my hands, just enough to let him know how strong I was.</p><p>\"Get out of here, Reggie,\"I said. \"Go find your friends in NOP Stick to protesting against new roads and bridges. You're in over your head here. Me and my friends in the Cirque are freaks, and freaks don't obey the same laws as other people. Understand?\"</p><p>\"You're crazy,\"he whimpered.</p><p>\"Yes,\"I said. \"But not as crazy as you'll be if you stay and interfere.\"</p><p>I stood and draped the sheep over my shoulders.</p><p>\"Going to the police would be useless, anyway,\"I said. \"By the time they reach the camp, this sheep will be long gone, bones and all.\"</p><p>\"You can do what you like, R.V. Stay or go. Report me to the police or keep your mouth shut. It's up to you. All I have left to say is this: To me and my kind, you're no different from this sheep.\"I gave it a shake. \"We'd think no more of killing you than we would any dumb animal in the fields.\"</p><p>\"You're a monster!\"R.V. yelled.</p><p>\"Yeah,\"I agreed. \"But I'm only a baby monster. You should see what some of the others are like.\"I smiled nastily at him, hating myself for acting so mean, but knowing this was the way it had to be. \"So long, Reggie Veggie,\"I said sarcastically, and walked away.</p><p>I didn't look back. I didn't need to. I could hear the chattering of his terrified teeth practically all the way back to camp.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>This time I went straight to Mr. Tall and told him about R.V. He listened carefully, then said, \"You handled him well.\"</p><p>\"I did what I had to,\"I replied. \"I'm not proud of it. I don't like bullying or scaring people, but there was no other way.\"</p><p>\"Actually, you should have killed him,\"Mr. Tall said. \"That way he could do us no harm whatsoever.\"</p><p>\"I'm not a murderer,\"I told him.</p><p>\"I know.\"He sighed. \"Nor am I. It's a pity one of the Little People wasn't with you. They'd have chopped his head off without a second's hesitation.\"</p><p>\"What do you think we should do?\"I asked.</p><p>\"I don't think he can cause many problems,\"Mr. Tall said. \"He'll probably be too scared to go to the police right away. Even if he does, there's no evidence against you. It would be an unwanted complication, but we've had plenty of dealings with officers of the law in the past. We could cope.\"</p><p>\"The health authorities worry me more. We could hit the road and lose them, but people in the health department tend to trail you around like hound dogs once they've got your scent.</p>","<p>\"We'll leave tomorrow,\"he decided. \"There's a show scheduled for tonight, and I hate canceling on short notice. Dawn is the earliest any health inspector could be here, so we'll make sure we're gone before then.\"</p><p>\"You're not angry with me?\"I asked.</p><p>\"No,\"he said. \"This isn't the first time we've clashed with the public. You're not to blame.\"</p><p>I helped Mr. Tall spread the word of our departure. Everybody took it in stride. Most seemed happy to be getting this much notice; a lot of times they had to move on with only an hour or two of warning.</p><p>It was another busy day for me. As well as preparing for the show, I had to help people get ready for leaving. I offered to help Truska pack her stuff, but her tent was already bare when I got there. She only winked when I asked how she'd packed so quickly.</p><p>When Mr. Crepsley awoke I told him about our plan to leave. He didn't seem surprised.</p><p>\"We have been here long enough,\"he said.</p><p>I asked to be left out of that night's show, because I wasn't feeling very well.</p><p>\"I'll get to bed early,\"I said, \"and get a good night's sleep.\"</p><p>\"It will not do any good,\"Mr. Crepsley warned. \"There is only one thing that will make you feel better, and you know what it is.\"</p><p>Night rolled on, and soon it was time for the show to begin. There was another big crowd. The roads were blocked with cars in both directions. Everybody in the Cirque was busy, either preparing to go onstage or getting people seated or selling stuff.</p><p>The only two who seemed to have nothing to do were me and Evra, who wasn't performing because of his sick snake. He left her for a few minutes to watch the start of the show. We stood on one side of the stage as Mr. Tall got the ball rolling and introduced the wolf-man.</p><p>We stuck around until the first break, then walked outside and studied the stars.</p><p>\"I'll miss this place when we go,\"Evra said. \"I like the country. You can't see stars as well in the city.\"</p><p>\"I didn't know you were interested in astronomy,\"I said.</p><p>\"I'm not,\"he replied. \"But I like looking up at the stars.\"</p><p>I got dizzy after a while and had to sit down.</p><p>\"You're not feeling too good, are you?\"Evra asked.</p><p>I smiled weakly. \"I've been better.\"</p><p>\"Still not drinking human blood?\"I shook my head. He sat beside me. \"You've never told me exactly why you won't drink it,\"he said. \"It can't be so different from animal blood, can it?\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\"I said. \"And I don't want to find out.\"I paused. \"I'm afraid that if I drink human blood, I'll be evil. Mr. Crepsley says vampires aren't evil, but I think they are. I think anyone who looks at humans as if they're animals must be evil.\"</p><p>\"But if it keeps you alive...\"Evra said.</p><p>\"That's how it would start,\"I said. \"I'd tell myself I was doing it to keep going. I'd swear never to drink more than I needed. But what if I couldn't stop myself? I'll need more as I grow older. What if I couldn't control my thirst? What if I killed someone?\"</p><p>\"I don't think you could,\"Evra said. \"You're not evil, Darren. I don't think a good person can do evil things. As long as you treat human blood like medicine, you'll be all right.\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\"I said, although I didn't believe it. \"Anyway, I'm okay for now. I don't have to make a final decision for a couple more days.\"</p><p>\"Would you really let yourself die rather than drink?\"Evra asked.</p><p>\"I don't know,\"I answered honestly.</p><p>\"I'd miss you if you died,\"Evra said sadly.</p><p>\"Well,\"I said uncomfortably, \"maybe it won't come to that. Maybe there's some other way I can survive, a way that Mr. Crepsley doesn't want to tell me about until he has no other choice.\"</p><p>Evra grunted. He knew as well as I did that there was no other way.</p><p>\"I'm going to check on my snake,\"he said. \"Do you want to come and sit with us for a while?\"</p><p>\"No,\"I said. \"I'd better get some sleep. We have to get up early, and I'm really tired.\"</p><p>We said good night. I didn't head straight for Mr. Crepsley's van but wandered through the campsite, thinking about my conversation with Evra, wondering what it would feel like to die. I'd ?died? once before, and been buried, but that wasn't the same thing. If I died for real, I'd be dead for good. Life would be over, my body would decay, and then...</p><p>I glanced up at the stars. Was that where I'd be heading? To the other side of the universe? Vampire Paradise?</p><p>It was a weird time. When I was living at home I'd hardly ever thought about death; it was something that only happened to old people. Now here I was, almost face to face with it.</p><p>If only somebody else could decide for me. I should be worrying about school and making the soccer team, not about whether I should drink human blood or let myself die. It wasn't fair. I was too young. I shouldn't have to -</p><p>I saw a shadow passing the front of a nearby tent but didn't pay much attention. It wasn't until I heard a sharp snapping sound that I wondered who it might be. Nobody should have been out there. Everyone involved with the show was in the big tent. Was it somebody from the audience?</p><p>I decided to investigate.</p><p>I headed in the direction that the shadow had taken. It was a dark night, and after a few turns I couldn't figure out which way the person had gone. I was on the verge of abandoning the search when I heard another sharp snapping sound, closer this time.</p><p>I looked around and knew immediately where the sounds must have come from: the wolf-man's cage !</p><p>Taking a deep breath to steady my nerves, I ran as fast as I could to check it out.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>The grass was damp, so it bent beneath my feet and made no sound. When I reached the last van before the wolf-man's cage, I stopped and listened.</p><p>There was a soft jangling sound, as though heavy chains were being lightly shaken.</p><p>I stepped out from under cover.</p><p>There were dim lights on either side of the wolf-man's cage, so I was able to see everything in perfect detail. He'd been wheeled back here after his act, like he was every night. There was a slab of meat in his cage, which normally he'd be feasting on. But not tonight. Tonight he was focused on something different.</p><p>There was a big man in front of the wolf-man's cage. He had a huge pair of pliers with him and had cut some of the chains that were holding the door shut.</p><p>The man was trying to unwrap the chains but wasn't doing very well. He swore softly to himself and lifted the pliers to cut through another link.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\"I shouted.</p><p>The man jumped with shock, dropped the pliers, and spun around.</p><p>It was, as I had guessed, R.V.</p><p>He looked guilty and scared at first, but when he saw I was alone he grew in confidence.</p><p>\"Stay back!\"he warned.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\"I demanded.</p><p>\"Freeing this poor, abused creature,\"he said. \"I wouldn't keep the wildest of animals in a cage like this. It's inhumane. I'm letting him go. I called the police - they'll be out here in the morning - but I decided to do a little work of my own beforehand.\"</p><p>\"You can't do that!\"I shrieked. \"Are you crazy? That guy's savage. He'd kill everything within a five-mile radius if you let him out!\"</p><p>\"So you say,\"R.V. sneered. \"I don't believe that. It's been my experience that animals react according to how they're treated. If you treat them like crazy monsters, they'll act that way. If, on the other hand, you treat them with respect, love, and humanity...\"</p><p>\"You don't know what you're doing,\"I told him.</p><p>\"The wolf-man isn't like other animals. Walk away from there before you do any real damage. We can talk it over. We can -\"</p><p>\"No!\"he screamed. \"I'm through talking!\"</p><p>He spun back to the chains and began struggling with them again. He reached into the cage and tugged the thickest chains through the bars. The wolf-man watched him silently.</p><p>\"R.V., stop!\"I shouted, and raced over to stop him from opening the door. I grabbed his shoulders and tried pulling him away, but I wasn't strong enough. I punched him in the ribs a few times, but he only grunted and doubled his efforts.</p><p>I grabbed for his hands, to pry them off the chains, but the bars were in the way.</p><p>\"Leave me alone!\"R.V. yelled. He turned his head to speak to me directly. His eyes were wild. \"You won't stop me!\"he screamed. \"You won't prevent me from doing my duty. I'll free this victim. I'll see justice done. I'll -\"</p><p>He stopped ranting all of a sudden. His face turned deathly white and his body shuddered, then went stiff.</p><p>There was a crunching, munching, ripping sound, and when I looked inside the cage, I realized the wolf-man had made his move.</p><p>He'd sprung across the cage while we were arguing, grabbed both of R.V.'s arms, jammed them in his mouth, and bitten them off below the elbows !</p><p>R.V. fell away from the cage, shocked. He lifted his shortened arms and watched as blood pumped from the holes at the ends of his elbows.</p><p>I tried grabbing his lower arms back from the mouth of the wolf-man - if I could retrieve them, they could be stuck back on - but he moved too quickly for me, leaped back out of reach, and began chewing. Within seconds the arms were a mess, and I knew they'd never be any good again.</p><p>\"Where are my hands?\"R.V. cried.</p><p>I switched my attention back to him. He was staring at the stumps that were his arms, a funny look on his face, not yet feeling the pain.</p><p>\"Where are my hands?\"he cried again. \"They're gone. They were there a minute ago. Where did all this blood come from? Why can I see the bone inside my skin?</p><p>\"Where are my hands ?\"He screamed this last question at the top of his lungs.</p><p>\"You have to come with me,\"I said frantically. \"We have to take care of your arms before you bleed to death.\"</p><p>\"Stay away from me!\"R.V. yelled. He tried raising a hand to shove me back, then remembered he didn't have hands anymore.</p><p>\"You're responsible for this!\"he shouted. \"You did this to me!\"</p><p>\"No, R.V., it was the wolf-man,\"I said, but he wasn't listening.</p><p>\"This is your fault,\"he insisted. \"You took my hands. You're an evil little monster, and you stole my hands. My hands! My hands!\"</p><p>He began screaming again. I reached for him, but this time he brushed me aside, turned, and ran. He tore screaming through the camp, his blood-drenched half-arms raised high above his head, yelling as loudly as he could, until he vanished into the night.</p><p>\"My hands! My hands! My hands!\"</p><p>I wanted to run after him but was afraid he might attack me. I ran off to find Mr. Crepsley and Mr. Tall - they'd know what to do - but was stopped dead in my tracks by a worrying growl behind me.</p><p>I turned slowly. The wolf-man was at the door of the cage, which was swinging wide open! He'd somehow removed the last of the chains and freed himself.</p><p>I remained perfectly still as he stood and grinned viciously, his long, sharp teeth glinting in the dim light.</p><p>He looked to the left and to the right, stretched out his hands, and grabbed the bars on either side. Then he crouched down low and tensed his legs.</p><p>He sprang, propelling himself toward me.</p><p>I shut my eyes and waited for the end to come.</p><p>I heard and felt him land about a foot in front of me. I began to say my final prayers.</p><p>But then I heard him flying overhead and realized he'd bounced over me. For a couple of terrifying seconds I waited for his teeth to bite through the back of my neck and gnaw my head off.</p><p>But they didn't.</p><p>Confused, I turned, blinking. He was racing away from me! I saw a figure ahead of him, running quickly between the trailers, and realized he was after somebody else. He'd passed me up for a tastier meal!</p><p>I took several stumbling steps after the wolf-man. I was smiling and silently thanking the gods. I couldn't believe how close I'd just come to death. When he'd leaped through the air, I was sure -</p><p>My feet struck something, and I stopped.</p><p>I looked down and saw a bag. The person the wolf-man was chasing must have dropped it, and for the first time I wondered who it was that the wild wolf-man was after.</p><p>I picked up the bag. It was the kind you carry over one shoulder. It was full of clothes, which I could feel through the cover. A small jar fell out as I turned the bag around. Retrieving it, I opened the lid and caught the bitter smell of... pickled onions!</p><p>My heart almost stopped. I began searching furiously for a name tag, praying the pickled onions didn't mean what I feared.</p><p>My prayers went unanswered.</p><p>The handwriting, when I found it, was neat but unjoined. The writing of a child.</p><p>\"This bag is the property of Sam Grest,\"it said, and his address was just beneath. \"Hands off!!\"it warned at the end, which was pretty ironic given what had happened a minute or so earlier to R.V.</p><p>But I didn't have time to laugh at my twisted, dark joke.</p><p>Sam ! For some reason he snuck out here tonight - probably to stow away with the Cirque - and must have seen and followed me. It was Sam the wolf-man's beady eyes had spotted, standing behind me. It was Sam running for his life through the camp.</p><p>The wolf-man was after Sam!</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-NINE</p><p>Ishouldn't have chased them on my own. I should have gone for help. It was crazy, rushing off into the darkness by myself.</p><p>But he was after Sam. Sam, who wanted to join the Cirque. Sam, who asked to be my blood brother. Harmless, friendly, long-winded Sam. The boy who'd saved my life.</p>","<p>I didn't think about my own safety. Sam was in trouble, and there wasn't time to seek anyone else's help. It might be the death of me, but I had to go after them, to try to save Sam. I owed him.</p><p>I got out of the camp quickly. The clouds had parted overhead and I spotted the wolf-man disappearing into the trees. I hurried after him, running as fast as I could.</p><p>I heard the wolf-man howl a while later, which was a good sign. It meant he was still chasing Sam. If he'd caught him, he'd be too busy eating to howl.</p><p>I wondered why he hadn't caught him yet. He should have. Although I'd never seen him running in the open, I was sure he must be fast. Maybe he was playing with Sam, toying with him before he moved in for the kill.</p><p>Their footprints were clear in the damp night earth, but I would have been able to follow from their sounds anyway. It's hard to run silently through a forest, especially at night.</p><p>We ran in that way for a few minutes, Sam and the wolf-man way in front and out of sight, me trailing behind. My legs were beginning to get really tired, but I forced myself on.</p><p>I thought about what I'd do when I caught up. There was no way I could beat the wolf-man in a fair fight. I could smash him over the head with a stick or something, but probably not. He was strong and fast, and had the taste for human blood. He'd be pretty much unstoppable.</p><p>The most I could hope to do was throw myself in his path and take Sam's place. If I offered myself instead of Sam, maybe he'd take me and Sam could escape.</p><p>I wouldn't mind dying for Sam. I'd given up my humanity for one friend; it wasn't asking so much more to give up my life for another.</p><p>Besides, this way, if I died, it would be for a good cause. I wouldn't have to worry anymore about drinking human blood or starving to death. I could go down fighting.</p><p>After a few more minutes, I ran into a clearing and realized where Sam had led us: the old deserted railroad station.</p><p>It showed he was still thinking clearly. This was the best place to come, with plenty of hiding spots and lots of stuff - chunks of metal and glass - to use in a fight. Maybe neither of us would have to die. Maybe there was a chance we could win this battle.</p><p>I saw the wolf-man pause in the middle of the station yard and sniff the air. He howled again, a loud spine-shivering howl, then sprinted toward one of the rusty train cars.</p><p>I ran around the back of the car, moving as quietly as I could. I listened for sounds when I got there but couldn't hear anything. I lifted myself up and looked in one of the windows: nothing.</p><p>I lowered myself and slid along to the third window over. I couldn't see anything when I looked inside again.</p><p>I was lifting myself to peek in the next window, when I suddenly saw a metal bar moving toward my face at high speed.</p><p>I twisted to my side just in time to avoid it. It whistled by my face, scratching me but not doing any serious damage.</p><p>\"Sam, stop, it's me !\"I hissed, dropping to the ground. There was silence for a moment, then Sam's face appeared in the round window.</p><p>\"Darren?\"he whispered. \"What are you doing here?\"</p><p>\"I followed you,\"I said.</p><p>\"I thought you were the wolf-man. I was trying to kill you.\"</p><p>\"You practically did.\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry.\"</p><p>\"For God's sake, Sam, don't waste time apologizing,\"I snapped. \"We're in big trouble. We've got to think. Get out here quick.\"</p><p>He backed away from the window. There were soft shuffling sounds, then he appeared outside the car door. He looked to make sure the wolf-man wasn't around, jumped down, and crept over to me.</p><p>\"Where is he?\"Sam asked.</p><p>\"I don't know,\"I whispered. \"He's around somewhere, though. I saw him coming in this direction.\"</p><p>\"Maybe he found something else to attack.\"Sam whispered back hopefully. \"A sheep or a cow.\"</p><p>\"I wouldn't bet on it,\"I said. \"He wouldn't have run all this way just to abandon the chase at the very end.\"</p><p>We huddled close together, Sam covering the right with his eyes, me the left. I could feel his body trembling, and I'm sure he could feel mine shaking, too.</p><p>\"What are we going to do?\"Sam asked.</p><p>\"I don't know,\"I whispered. \"Any ideas?\"</p><p>\"A couple,\"he said. \"We could lead him into the guard's house. He might fall through the rotten floorboards. We could trap him down there.\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\"I said. \"But what if we fall through, too? We'd be trapped. He could jump down and eat us whenever he liked.\"</p><p>\"How about the rafters?\"Sam asked. \"We could climb out into the middle of a rafter and hang on, back to back. We could take sticks with us and beat him off if he attacked. There'd only be one way for him to come at us up there.\"</p><p>\"And somebody's got to arrive from the Cirque Du Freak sooner or later,\"I whispered, thinking it over. \"But what if he decides to snap the rafter at one end?\"</p><p>\"They're set pretty deeply into brick,\"Sam said. \"I don't think he could break them with his bare hands.\"</p><p>\"Would a rafter hold the weight of three of us?\"I asked.</p><p>\"I'm not sure,\"Sam admitted. \"But at least if we fell from that height it'd be over quickly. Who knows, we might get lucky and fall on the wolf-man. He could break our fall and get killed in the process.\"</p><p>I laughed weakly. \"You watch too many cartoons. But that's a good idea. Better than any I can think of.\"</p><p>\"How long do you think it'll be before the people from the Cirque get here?\"Sam whispered.</p><p>\"Depends on when they realize what's happening,\"I said. \"If we're lucky, they'll have heard him howling and might be here in a couple of minutes. Otherwise we might have to wait until the end of the show, which could be another hour, maybe longer.\"</p><p>\"Do you have a weapon?\"Sam asked.</p><p>\"No,\"I said. \"I didn't have time to pick anything up.\"</p><p>He handed me a short iron bar. \"Here,\"he said. \"I had this for backup. It's not very good, but it's better than nothing.\"</p><p>\"Any sign of the wolf-man?\"I asked.</p><p>\"No,\"he said. \"Not yet.\"</p><p>\"We'd better get going before he arrives,\"I whispered, then stopped. \"How are we going to go to the guard's house? It's a far hike, and the wolf-man could be hiding anywhere along the way.\"</p><p>\"We'll have to run for it and hope for the best,\"Sam said.</p><p>\"Should we split up?\"I asked.</p><p>\"No,\"he said. \"I think we're better off together.\"</p><p>\"Okay. Are you ready to start?\"</p><p>\"Gimme a few seconds,\"he said.</p><p>I turned and watched him breathing. His face was white, and his clothes were ripped and dirty from running through the woods, but he looked ready to fight. He was a tough little character.</p><p>\"Why did you come back tonight, Sam?\"I whispered.</p><p>\"To join the Cirque Du Freak,\"he answered.</p><p>\"Even after everything I told you about me?\"</p><p>\"I decided to risk it,\"he said. \"I mean, you're my friend. We have to stick by our friends, right? Your story made me want to join more, once I'd recovered from being scared. Maybe I could have helped you. I've read books about personality disorders. Maybe I could have cured you.\"</p><p>I couldn't help smiling in the middle of this horrifying moment we were in. \"You're a moron, Sam Grest,\"I whispered.</p><p>\"I know.\"He smiled. \"So are you. That's why we make a good team.\"</p><p>\"If we get out of this,\"I told him, \"feel free to join. And you don't have to worry about me eating you. That was just a story to frighten you off.\"</p><p>\"Really?\"he asked.</p><p>\"Really,\"I said.</p><p>\"Phew.\"He wiped his brow. \"I can rest easy now.\"</p><p>\"You can if the wolf-man doesn't get you,\"I said with a grin.</p><p>\"Ready yet?\"</p><p>\"I'm ready.\"He squeezed his palms and prepared to run. \"On the count of three,\"he whispered.</p><p>\"Okay,\"I replied.</p><p>\"One,\"he began.</p><p>We faced in the direction of the guard's house.</p><p>\"Two.\"</p><p>We got in position to sprint.</p><p>\"Thr-\"</p><p>Before he could finish, a pair of hairy hands darted out from underneath the car, where - I realized too late - the wolf-man was hiding. The fingers wrapped around Sam's lower legs, grabbed him by the ankles, and dragged him down to the ground.</p><p>Chapter THIRTY</p><p>Sam started to scream as soon as the hands tightened on his ankles. The fall knocked the breath out of him, silencing him momentarily, but after a second or two he was screaming again.</p><p>I scrambled to my knees, grabbed Sam's arms, and pulled as hard as I could.</p><p>I could see the wolf-man underneath the car, spread out on his hairy belly and grinning wildly. Drool was dripping from his jaws.</p><p>I pulled with all my might, and Sam slid toward me. But the wolf-man came with him, wriggling out from under the car, not loosening his grip.</p><p>I stopped pulling and let go of Sam. I grabbed the iron bar that he'd dropped, jumped to my feet, and began pounding the outstretched arms of the wolf-man, who howled angrily.</p><p>The wolf-man released one of his hairy paws and swatted at me. I ducked out of the way and struck at the hand still holding Sam. The wolf-man yelped with pain and his fingers came free.</p><p>\"Run!\"I screamed to Sam as I yanked him to his feet.</p><p>We sprinted toward the guard's house, side by side. I could hear the wolf-man scrambling out from beneath the car. He'd been playing with us before, but now he was furious. I knew he'd come at us with everything he had. The games were over. There was no way we'd make it to the guard's house. He'd have us before we were halfway across the yard.</p><p>\"Keep... running,\"I gasped to Sam, then stopped momentarily and looked back to meet the charge of the oncoming wolf-man.</p><p>My actions took him by surprise, and he ran into me. His body was hairy and sweaty and heavy. The collision sent both of us flying to the ground. Our arms and legs were all tangled up, but I quickly freed myself and whacked him with the iron bar.</p><p>The wolf-man roared angrily and swiped at my arm. This time he connected, just below where it joined with my shoulder. The force of the blow deadened my arm, which became a useless lump of flesh and bone. I dropped the bar, then reached for it with my other hand.</p><p>But the wolf-man was quicker. He snatched up the bar and tossed it far away, where it fell with a clang, lost to the darkness.</p><p>He stood slowly, grinning nastily. I could read the expression in his eyes and knew, if he could speak, he would be saying something like: \"Now, Darren Shan, you're mine! You had your fun and games, but now it's killing time!\"</p><p>He grabbed my body by the sides, opened his mouth wide, and leaned forward to bite my face off. I could smell the stench of his breath and see bits of meat and shirt from R.V.'s arms stuck between his yellow teeth.</p><p>Before he could snap his jaws shut, something hit the side of his head and knocked him off-balance.</p><p>I could see Sam behind him, a heavy chunk of wood in his hands. He hit the wolf-man again, this time making his hands let go.</p><p>\"One good turn deserves another!\"Sam screamed crazily, slamming the wood into the wolf-man for a third time. \"Come on! We have to -\"</p><p>I never heard Sam's next words. Because as I started toward him, the wolf-man lashed out blindly with one of his fists. It was a wild shot, but he got lucky and it slammed into my face, knocking me backward.</p><p>My head almost exploded. I saw bright lights and huge stars, then slumped to the ground, passed out.</p><p>When I came to a few seconds or minutes later - I don't even know how much time had passed - the railroad station was eerily quiet. I couldn't hear anybody running or screaming or fighting. All I could hear was a steady munching sound, a little way ahead of me.</p><p>Munch, munch, munch.</p><p>I sat up slowly, ignoring the hammering pain in my head.</p><p>It took my eyes a few seconds to readjust to the darkness. When I could see again, I realized I was gazing at the back of the wolf-man. He was crouched on all fours, head bent over something. He was the one making the munching sounds.</p><p>The dizziness from the punch meant it took me a while to realize it wasn't a something he was eating... it was a someone.</p><p>SAM!!!</p><p>I scrambled to my feet, pain forgotten, and rushed forward, but one look at the bloody mess beneath the wolf-man and I knew I was too late.</p><p>\"NO !\"I screamed and punched the wolf-man with my one good hand, attacking senselessly.</p><p>He grunted and shoved me away. I sprang back and this time kicked as well as punched. He growled and tried shoving again, but I held on and pulled his hair and ears.</p><p>He howled then and finally lifted his mouth. It was red, a dark, awful red, full of guts and blood and pieces of flesh and bone.</p><p>He rolled on top of me, forcing me down, and pinned me with one long, hairy arm. His head shot back and he howled up at the night sky. Then, with a demonic snarl, he drove his teeth toward my throat, meaning to finish me off with one quick bite.</p><p>Chapter THIRTY-ONE</p><p>At the last possible moment, a pair of hands appeared out of the darkness and grabbed the wolf-man's jaw, stopping his plunge.</p><p>The hands twisted the head to one side, causing the wolf-man to shriek and fall off me.</p><p>His attacker climbed onto his back and held him down. I saw fists flying faster than my eyes could follow, and then the wolf-man was lying unconscious on the ground.</p><p>His attacker stood and pulled me to my feet. I found myself gazing up into the flushed, scarred face of Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>\"I came as soon as I could,\"the vampire said somberly, turning my head gently to the left and right, examining the damage. \"Evra heard the howls of the wolf-man. He did not know about you and the boy. He just thought the creature had burst free.</p>","<p>\"Evra told Mr. Tall, who canceled the rest of the show and organized a search party. Then I thought of you. When I saw your bed was empty, I searched around and found your trail.\"</p><p>\"I thought... I was going to... die,\"I moaned, finding it hard to speak. I was bruised all over and suffering from shock. \"I was certain. I thought... nobody would come. I...\"</p><p>I threw my good arm around Mr. Crepsley and hugged him hard.</p><p>\"Thank you,\"I sobbed. \"Thank you. Thank you. Thank -\"</p><p>I stopped, remembering my fallen friend.</p><p>\"Sam!\"I screamed. I let go of Mr. Crepsley and rushed to where he was lying.</p><p>The wolf-man had torn Sam's stomach open and eaten a lot of his insides. Amazingly, Sam was still alive when I got to him. His eyelids were fluttering, and he was breathing lightly.</p><p>\"Sam, are you okay?\"I whispered. It was a stupid question, but the only one my trembling lips could form. \"Sam?\"I brushed his forehead with my fingers, but he showed no signs of hearing or feeling me. He just lay there, with his eyes staring up at me.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley knelt down beside me and checked Sam's body.</p><p>\"Can you save him?\"I cried. He shook his head slowly. \"You have to!\"I shouted. \"You can close the wounds. We can call a doctor. You can give him a potion. There must be some way to -\"</p><p>\"Darren,\"he said softly, \"there is nothing we can do. He is dying. The damage is too great. Another couple of minutes and...\"He sighed. \"At least he is beyond feeling. There will be no pain.\"</p><p>\"No!\"I screamed, and threw myself onto Sam. I was crying bitterly, sobbing so hard it hurt.</p><p>\"Sam! You can't die! Sam! Stay alive! You can join the Cirque and travel with us all over the world. You can... you...\"</p><p>I could say no more, only lower my head, cling to Sam, and let the tears pour down my face.</p><p>In the deserted old railroad yard, the wolf-man lay unconscious behind me. Mr. Crepsley sat silently by my side. Underneath me, Sam Grest - who'd been my friend and saved my life - lay perfectly still and slipped further and further into the final sleep of an unfair and horrible death.</p><p>Chapter THIRTY-TWO</p><p>After a while, I felt somebody tugging at the sleeve of my left arm. I looked around. Mr. Crepsley was standing over me, looking miserable.</p><p>\"Darren,\"he said, \"it will not seem like the right time, but there is something you must do. For Sam's sake. And your own.\"</p><p>\"What are you talking about?\"I wiped some of the tears from my face and stared up at him. \"Can we save him? Tell me if we can. I'll do anything.\"</p><p>\"There is nothing we can do to save his body ,\"Mr. Crepsley told me. \"He is dying and nothing can change that. But there is something we can do for his spirit.</p><p>\"Darren,\"he said, \"you must drink Sam's blood.\"</p><p>I went on staring at him, but now it was a stare of disbelief, not hope.</p><p>\"How could you?\"I whispered with disgust. \"One of my best friends is dying, and all you can think about... You're sick! You're a sick, twisted monster. You should be dying, not Sam. I hate you. Get out of here.\"</p><p>\"You do not understand,\"he said.</p><p>\"Yes I do!\"I screamed. \"Sam's dying, but all you're worried about is blooding me. Do you know what you are? You're a no-good -\"</p><p>\"Do you remember our discussion about vampires being able to absorb part of a person's spirit?\"he asked.</p><p>I was just about to call him something awful, but his question confused me.</p><p>\"What's that got to do with this?\"I asked.</p><p>\"Darren, this is important. Do you remember?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\"I said softly. \"What about it?\"</p><p>\"Sam is dying,\"Mr. Crepsley said. \"A few more minutes and he will be gone. Forever. But you can keep part of him alive within you if you drink from him now and take this life before the wounds of the wolf-man can.\"</p><p>I couldn't believe what I was hearing.</p><p>\"You want me to kill Sam?\"I screamed.</p><p>\"No,\"he sighed. \"Sam has already been killed. But if you finish him off before he dies from the bites of the wolf-man, you will save some of his memories and feelings. In you he can live on.\"</p><p>I shook my head. \"I can't drink his blood,\"I whispered. \"Not Sam's.\"I glanced down at the small, savaged body. \"I can't.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley sighed. \"I will not force you to,\"he said. \"But think carefully about it. What happened tonight is a tragedy that will haunt you for a very long time, but if you drink from Sam and absorb part of his essence, dealing with his death will be easier. Losing a loved one is hard. This way, you need not lose all of him.\"</p><p>\"I can't drink from him,\"I sobbed. \"He was my friend.\"</p><p>\"It is because he was your friend that you must,\"Mr. Crepsley said, then turned away and left me to decide.</p><p>I stared down at Sam. He looked so lifeless, like he'd already lost everything that made him human, alive, unique. I thought of his jokes and long words and hopes and dreams, and how awful it would be if all of that just disappeared with his death.</p><p>Kneeling, I placed the fingers of my left hand on Sam's red neck. \"I'm sorry, Sam,\"I moaned, then dug my sharp nails into his soft flesh, leaned forward, and stuck my mouth over the holes they'd made.</p><p>Blood gushed in and made me gag. I nearly fell away, but with an effort I held my place and gulped it down. His blood was hot and salty and ran down my throat like thick, creamy butter.</p><p>Sam's pulse slowed as I drank, then stopped. But I went on drinking, swallowing every last drop, absorbing.</p><p>When I'd finally sucked him dry, I turned away and howled at the sky like the wolf-man had. For a long time that's all I could do, howl and scream and cry like the wild animal of the night that I'd become.</p><p>Chapter THIRTY-THREE</p><p>Mr. tall and a bunch of others from the Cirque Du Freak - including four Little People - arrived a little later. I was sitting by Sam's side, too tired to howl anymore, staring blankly into space, feeling his blood settle in my stomach.</p><p>\"What's the story?\"Mr. Tall asked Mr. Crepsley. \"How did the wolf-man get free?\"</p><p>\"I do not know, Hibernius,\"Mr. Crepsley replied. \"I have not asked and do not intend to, not for a night or two at least. Darren is in no shape for an interrogation.\"</p><p>\"Is the wolf-man dead?\"Mr. Tall asked.</p><p>\"No,\"Mr. Crepsley said. \"I merely knocked him out.\"</p><p>\"Thank heaven for small mercies.\"Mr. Tall sighed. He clicked his fingers and the Little People chained up the unconscious wolf-man. A van from the show pulled up and they bundled him into the back.</p><p>I thought about demanding the wolf-man's death, but what good would it have been? He wasn't evil, just naturally mad. Killing him would have been pointless and cruel.</p><p>When they'd finished with the wolf-man, the Little People's attention turned to Sam's shredded remains.</p><p>\"Hold on,\"I said, as they bent to pick him up and cart him away. \"What are they going to do with Sam?\"</p><p>Mr. Tall coughed uncomfortably. \"I, ah, imagine they intend to dispose of him,\"he said.</p><p>It took me a moment to realize what that meant. \"They're going to eat him?\"I shrieked.</p><p>\"We can't just leave him here,\"Mr. Tall reasoned, \"and we don't have time to bury him. This is the easiest -\"</p><p>\"No,\"I said firmly.</p><p>\"Darren,\"Mr. Crepsley said, \"we should not interfere with -\"</p><p>\"No!\"I shouted, striding over to shove the Little People backward. \"If they want to eat Sam, they'll have to eat me first!\"</p><p>The Little People stared at me wordlessly, with hungry green eyes.</p><p>\"I think they'd be quite happy to accommodate you,\"Mr. Tall said drily.</p><p>\"I mean it,\"I growled. \"I won't let them eat Sam. He deserves a proper burial.\"</p><p>\"So that worms can devour him?\"Mr. Tall asked, then sighed when I glared at him, and shook his head irritably.</p><p>\"Let the boy have his way, Hibernius,\"Mr. Crepsley said quietly. \"You may return to the Cirque with the others. I will stay and help dig the grave.\"</p><p>\"Very well.\"Mr. Tall shrugged. He whistled and pointed a finger at the Little People. They hesitated, then backed away and crowded around the owner of the Cirque Du Freak, leaving me alone with the dead Sam Grest.</p><p>Mr. Tall and his assistants left. Mr. Crepsley sat down beside me.</p><p>\"How are you?\"he asked.</p><p>I shook my head. There was no simple answer to that.</p><p>\"Do you feel stronger?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\"I said softly. Even though it hadn't been long since I'd drank Sam's blood, already I noticed a difference. My eyesight had improved and so had my hearing, and my battered body didn't hurt nearly as much as it should.</p><p>\"You will not have to drink again for a long time,\"he said.</p><p>\"I don't care. I didn't do it for me. I did it for Sam.\"</p><p>\"Are you angry with me?\"he asked.</p><p>\"No,\"I said slowly.</p><p>\"Darren,\"he said, \"I hope -\"</p><p>\"I don't want to talk about it!\"I snapped. \"I'm cold, sore, miserable, and lonely. I want to think about Sam, not waste words on you.\"</p><p>\"As you wish,\"he said, and began digging in the soil with his fingers. I dug beside him in silence for a few minutes, then paused and looked over.</p><p>\"I'm a real vampire's assistant now, aren't I?\"I asked.</p><p>He nodded sadly. \"Yes. You are.\"</p><p>\"Does that make you glad?\"</p><p>\"No,\"he said. \"It makes me feel ashamed.\"</p><p>As I stared at him, confused, a figure appeared above us. It was the Little Person with the limp. \"If you think you're taking Sam...\"I warned him, raising a dirt-encrusted hand. Before I got any further, he jumped into the shallow hole, stuck his wide, gray-skinned fingers into the soil, and clawed up large clumps.</p><p>\"He's helping us?\"I asked, puzzled.</p><p>\"It seems like it,\"Mr. Crepsley said, and laid a hand on my back. \"Rest,\"he advised. \"We can dig faster by ourselves. I will call you when it is time to bury your friend.\"</p><p>I nodded, crawled out, and lay down on the bank beside the quickly forming grave. After a while I shuffled out of the way and sat, waiting, in the shadows of the old railroad station. Just me and my thoughts. And Sam's dark, red blood on my lips and between my teeth.</p><p>Chapter THIRTY-FOUR</p><p>We buried Sam without much talk - I couldn't think of anything to say - and filled in the grave. We didn't hide it, so he'd be discovered by the police and given a real burial soon. I wanted his parents to be able to give him a ceremony, but this would keep him safe from scavenging animals (and Little People) in the meantime.</p><p>We broke camp before dawn. Mr. Tall told everybody there was a long trek ahead. Sam's disappearance would create a fuss, so we had to get as far away as possible.</p><p>I wondered, as we left, what had become of R.V. Did he bleed to death in the forest? Did he make it to a doctor in time? Or was he still running and screaming, \"My hands! My hands!\"?</p><p>I didn't care. Although he'd been trying to do the right thing, this was R.V.'s fault. If he hadn't gone messing with the locks on the wolf-man's cage, Sam would be alive. I didn't hope R.V. was dead, but I didn't say a prayer for him, either. I'd leave him to fate and whatever it had in store.</p><p>Evra sat beside me at the rear of the van as the Cirque pulled out. He started to say something. Stopped. Cleared his throat. Then he put a bag on my lap. \"I found that,\"he muttered. \"Thought you might want it.\"</p><p>Through stinging eyes I read the name - \"Sam Grest\"- then burst into tears and cried bitterly over it. Evra put his arms around me and held me tight and cried along with me.</p><p>\"Mr. Crepsley told me what happened,\"Evra mumbled eventually, recovering slightly and wiping his face clean. \"He said you drank Sam's blood to keep his spirit alive.\"</p><p>\"Apparently,\"I replied weakly, unconvinced.</p><p>\"Look,\"Evra said, \"I know how much you didn't want to drink human blood, but you did this for Sam. It was an act of goodness, not evil. You shouldn't feel bad for drinking from him.\"</p><p>\"I guess,\"I said, then moaned at the memory and cried some more.</p><p>The day went by and the Cirque Du Freak rolled on, but thoughts of Sam couldn't be left behind. As night came, we pulled over to the side of the road for a short break. Evra went to look for food and drinks.</p><p>\"Do you want anything?\"he asked.</p><p>\"No,\"I said, my face pressed against the window-pane. \"I'm not hungry.\"</p><p>He started to leave.</p><p>I called him back. \"Wait a sec.\"</p><p>There was a strange taste in my mouth. Sam's blood was still hot on my lips, salty and terrible, but that wasn't what had started the buds at the back of my tongue tingling. There was something I wanted that I'd never wanted before. For a few confusing seconds I didn't know what it was. Then I identified the strange craving and managed to crack the thinnest of smiles. I searched Sam's bag, but the jar must have been left behind when we left.</p><p>Looking up at Evra, I wiped tears from my eyes, licked my lips, and asked in a voice that sounded a lot like that smart-ass kid I once knew, \"Do we have any pickled onions?\"</p>"]},{"title":"Tunnels of Blood","pages":["<p>PROLOGUE</p><p>The smell of blood is sickening. Hundreds of carcasses hang from silver hooks, stiff, shiny with frosty blood. I know they're just animals - cows, pigs, sheep - but I keep thinking they're human.</p><p>I take a careful step forward. Powerful overhead lights mean it's bright as day. I have to tread carefully. Hide behind the dead animals. Move slowly. The floor's slippery with water and blood, which makes progress even trickier.</p><p>Ahead, I spot him... the vampire... Mr. Crepsley. He's moving as quietly as I am, eyes focused on the fat man a little way ahead.</p><p>The fat man. He's why I'm here in this ice-cold slaughterhouse. He's the human Mr. Crepsley intends to kill. He's the man I have to save.</p><p>The fat man pauses and checks one of the hanging slabs of meat. His cheeks are chubby and red. He's wearing clear plastic gloves. He pats the dead animal - the squeaky noise of the hook as the carcass swings puts my teeth on edge - then begins whistling. He starts to walk again. Mr. Crepsley follows. So do I.</p><p>Evra is somewhere far behind. I left him outside. No point in both of us risking our lives.</p><p>I pick up speed, moving slowly closer. Neither knows I'm here. If everything works out as planned, they won't know, not until Mr. Crepsley makes his move. Not until I'm forced to act.</p><p>The fat man stops again. Bends to examine something. I take a quick step back, afraid he'll spot me, but then I see Mr. Crepsley closing in. Damn! No time to hide. If this is the moment he's chosen to attack, I have to get nearer.</p><p>I spring forward several feet, risking being heard. Luckily Mr. Crepsley is entirely focused on the fat man.</p><p>I'm only three or four feet behind the vampire now. I bring up the long butcher's knife that I've been holding down by my side. My eyes are glued to Mr. Crepsley. I won't act until he does - I'll give him every chance to prove my terrible suspicions wrong - but the second I see him tensing to spring...</p><p>I take a firmer grip on the knife. I've been practicing my swipe all day. I know the exact point I want to hit. One quick cut across Mr. Crepsley's throat and that'll be that. No more vampire. One more carcass to add to the pile.</p><p>Long seconds slip by. I don't dare look to see what the fat man is studying. Is he ever going to rise?</p><p>Then it happens. The fat man struggles to his feet. Mr. Crepsley hisses. He gets ready to lunge. I position the knife and steady my nerves. The fat man's on his feet now. He hears something. Looks up at the ceiling - wrong way, idiot! - as Mr. Crepsley leaps. As the vampire jumps, so do I, screeching loudly, slashing at him with the knife, determined to kill...</p><p>Chapter ONE</p><p>One month earlier...</p><p>My name's Darren Shan. I'm a half-vampire.</p><p>I used to be human, until I stole a vampire's spider. After that, my life changed forever. Mr. Crepsley - the vampire - forced me to become his assistant, and I joined a circus full of weird performers called the Cirque Du Freak.</p><p>Adapting was hard. Drinking blood was harder, and for a long time I wouldn't do it. Eventually I did, to save the memories of a dying friend (vampires can store a person's memories if they drain all their blood). I didn't enjoy it - the following few weeks were horrible, and I was plagued by nightmares - but after that first blood-red drink there could be no going back. I accepted my role as a vampire's assistant and learned to make the best of it.</p><p>Over the course of the next year, Mr. Crepsley taught me how to hunt and drink without being caught; how to take just enough blood to survive; how to hide my vampire identity when mixing with others. And in time I put my human fears behind me and became a true creature of the night.</p><p>A couple of girls stood watching Cormac Limbs with serious expressions. He was stretching his arms and legs, rolling his neck around, loosening his muscles. Then, winking at the girls, he put the middle three fingers of his right hand between his teeth and bit them off.</p><p>The girls screamed and fled. Cormac chuckled and wriggled the new fingers that were growing out of his hand.</p><p>I laughed. You got used to stuff like that when you worked in the Cirque Du Freak. The traveling show was full of incredible people, freaks of nature with cool and sometimes frightening powers.</p><p>Apart from Cormac Limbs, the performers included Rhamus Twobellies, capable of eating a full-grown elephant or an army tank; Gertha Teeth, who could bite through steel; the wolf-man - half man, half wolf, who'd killed my friend Sam Grest; Truska, a beautiful and mysterious woman who could grow a beard at will; and Mr. Tall, who could move as fast as lightning and seemed to be able to read people's minds. Mr. Tall owned and managed the Cirque Du Freak.</p><p>We were performing in a small town, camped behind an old mill inside which the show was staged every night. It was a run-down junkyard, but I was used to that type of venue. We could have played the grandest theaters in the world and slept in luxurious hotel rooms - the Cirque made a ton of money - but it was safer to keep a low profile and stick to places where the police and other officials rarely wandered.</p><p>My appearance hadn't changed much since leaving home with Mr. Crepsley almost a year and a half before. Because I was a half-vampire, I aged at only a fifth the rate of humans, which meant that though eighteen months had passed, my body was only three or four months older.</p><p>Although I wasn't very different on the outside, inside I was an entirely new person. I was stronger than any boy my age, able to run faster, leap farther, and dig my extra-strong nails into brick walls. My hearing, eyesight, and sense of smell had improved vastly.</p><p>Since I wasn't a full vampire, there was lots of stuff I couldn't do yet. For example, Mr. Crepsley could run at a superquick speed, which he called flitting. He could breathe out a gas that knocked people unconscious. And he could communicate telepathically with vampires and a few others, such as Mr. Tall.</p><p>I wouldn't be able to do those things until I became a full vampire. I didn't lose any sleep over it, because being a half-vampire had its bonuses: I didn't have to drink much human blood and - better yet - I could move around during the day.</p><p>It was daytime when I was exploring a garbage dump with Evra, the snake-boy, looking for food for the Little People - weird, small creatures who wore blue hooded capes and never spoke. Nobody - except maybe Mr. Tall - knew who or what they were, where they came from, or why they traveled with the Cirque. Their master was a creepy man called Mr. Tiny (he liked to eat children!), but we didn't see much of him at the Cirque.</p><p>\"Found a dead dog,\" Evra shouted, holding it above his head. \"It smells a little. Do you think they'll mind?\"</p><p>I sniffed the air - Evra was a long way off, but I could smell the dog from here as well as a human could up close - and shook my head. \"It'll be fine,\" I said. The Little People ate just about anything we brought.</p><p>I had a fox and a few rats in my bag. I felt bad about killing the rats - rats are friendly with vampires and usually come up to us like tame pets if we call them - but work is work. We all have to do things we don't like in life.</p><p>There were a bunch of Little People with the Cirque - twenty of them - and one was hunting with Evra and me. He'd been with the Cirque since soon after me and Mr. Crepsley joined. I could tell him apart from the others because he had a limp in his left leg. Evra and me had taken to calling him Lefty.</p><p>\"Hey, Lefty!\" I shouted. \"How's it going?\" The small figure in the blue hooded cape didn't answer - he never did - but he patted his stomach, which was the sign we needed more food.</p><p>\"Lefty says to keep going,\" I told Evra.</p><p>\"Figures,\" he sighed.</p><p>As I prowled for another rat, I spotted a small silver cross in the garbage. I picked it up and brushed off the dirt. Studying the cross, I smiled. To think I used to believe vampires were terrified of crosses! Most of that stuff in old movies and books is crap. Crosses, holy water, garlic: none of those matter to vampires. We can cross running water. We don't have to be invited into a house before entering. We cast shadows and reflections (though a full vampire can't be photographed - something to do with bouncing atoms). We can't change shape or fly.</p><p>A stake through the heart will kill a vampire. But so will a well-placed bullet, or fire, or a heavy falling object. We're harder to kill than humans, but we aren't immortal. Far from it.</p><p>I placed the cross on the ground and stood back. Focusing my will, I tried making it jump into my left hand. I stared hard for all of a minute, then clicked the fingers of my right hand.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>I tried again but still couldn't do it. I'd been trying for months, with no success. Mr. Crepsley made it look simple - one click of his fingers and an object would be in his hand, even if it was several feet away - but I hadn't been able to copy him.</p><p>I was getting along pretty well with Mr. Crepsley. He wasn't such a bad guy. We weren't friends, but I'd accepted him as a teacher and no longer hated him like I did when he first turned me into a half-vampire.</p><p>I put the cross in my pocket and proceeded with the hunt. After a while I found a half-starved cat in the remains of an old microwave oven. It was after rats, too.</p><p>The cat hissed at me and the hair on its neck raised. I pretended to turn my back on it, then spun quickly, grabbed it by the neck, and twisted. It gave a strangled little cry and then went limp. I stuck it in the bag and went to see how Evra was doing.</p><p>I didn't enjoy killing animals, but hunting was part of my nature. Anyway, I had no sympathy for cats. The blood of cats is poisonous to vampires. Drinking from one wouldn't have killed me, but it would have made me sick. And cats are hunters, too. The way I saw it, the less cats there were, the more rats there'd be.</p><p>That night, back in camp, I tried moving the cross with my mind again. I'd finished my jobs for the day, and the show wouldn't be starting for another couple of hours, so I had lots of time to kill.</p><p>It was a cold late-November night. There hadn't been any snow yet, but it was threatening. I was dressed in my colorful pirate costume: a light green shirt, dark purple pants, a gold-and-blue jacket, a red satin cloth around my waist, a brown hat with a feather in it, and soft shoes with toes that curled in on themselves.</p><p>I wandered away from the vans and tents and found a secluded spot around the side of the old mill.</p><p>I stuck the cross on a piece of wood in front of me, took a deep breath, concentrated on the cross, and willed it into the palm of my outstretched hand.</p><p>No good.</p><p>I shuffled closer, so my hand was only inches away from the cross.</p><p>\"I command you to move,\" I said, clicking my fingers. \"I order you to move.\" Click. \"Move.\" Click. \" Move!\"</p><p>I shouted this last word louder than I meant to and stomped my foot in anger.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" a familiar voice asked behind me.</p><p>Looking up, I saw Mr. Crepsley emerging out of the shadows.</p><p>\"Nothing,\" I said, trying to hide the cross.</p><p>\"What is that?\" he asked. His eyes missed nothing.</p><p>\"Just a cross I found while Evra and me were hunting,\" I said, holding it out.</p><p>\"What were you doing with it?\" Mr. Crepsley asked suspiciously.</p><p>\"Trying to make it move,\" I said, deciding it was time to ask the vampire about his magic secrets. \"How do you do it?\"</p><p>A smile spread across his face, causing the long scar that ran down the left side to crinkle. \"So that is what has been bothering you.\" He chuckled. He stretched out a hand and clicked his ringers, causing me to blink. Next thing I knew, the cross was in his hand.</p><p>\"How's it done?\" I asked. \"Can only full vampires do it?\"</p><p>\"I will demonstrate again. Watch closely this time.\"</p><p>Replacing the cross on the piece of wood, he stood back and clicked his fingers. Once again it disappeared and turned up in his hand. \"Did you see?\"</p><p>\"See what?\" I was confused.</p><p>\"One final time,\" he said. \"Try not to blink.\"</p><p>I focused on the small silver piece. I heard his fingers clicking and - keeping my eyes wide open - thought I saw the slightest blur darting between me and the cross.</p><p>When I turned to look at him, he was tossing the cross from hand to hand and smiling. \"Figured me out yet?\" he asked.</p><p>I frowned. \"I thought I saw... it looked like...\" My face lit up. \"You didn't move the cross!\" I yelled excitedly. \" Youmoved!\"</p><p>He beamed. \"Not as dull as you appear,\" he complimented me in his usual sarcastic manner.</p><p>\"Do it again,\" I said. This time I didn't look at the cross: I watched the vampire. I wasn't able to track his movements - he was too fast - but I caught brief glimpses of him as he darted forward, snatched up the cross, and leaped back.</p><p>\"So you're not able to move things with your mind?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Of course not.\" He laughed.</p><p>\"Then why the click of the fingers?\"</p><p>\"To distract the eye,\" he explained.</p><p>\"Then it's a trick,\" I said. \"It's got nothing to do with being a vampire.\"</p><p>He shrugged. \"I could not move so fast if I were human, but yes, it is a trick. I dabbled with illusions before I became a vampire, and I still like to practice.\"</p><p>\"Could I learn to do it?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Maybe,\" he said. \"You cannot move as fast as I can, but you could get away with it if the object was close to hand. You would have to practice hard - but if you wish, I can teach you.\"</p><p>\"I always wanted to be a magician,\" I said. \"But... hold on...\" I remembered a couple of occasions when Mr. Crepsley had opened locks with a click of his fingers. \"What about locks?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Those are different. You understand what static energy is?\" My face was a blank. \"Have you ever brushed a comb through your hair and held it up to a thin sheet of paper?\"</p>","<p>\"Yeah!\" I said. \"The paper sticks to it.\"</p><p>\"That is static energy,\" he explained. \"When a vampire flits, a very strong static charge builds up. I have learned to harness that charge. Thus I am able to force open any lock you care to mention.\"</p><p>I thought about that. \"And the click of your fingers?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Old habits die hard.\" He smiled.</p><p>\"But old vampires die easy!\" a voice growled behind us, and before I knew what was happening, someone had reached around the two of us and pressed a pair of razor-sharp knives to the soft flesh of our throats!</p><p>Chapter TWO</p><p>I froze at the touch of the blade and the threatening voice, but Mr. Crepsley didn't even blink. He pushed the knife gently away from his throat, then tossed the silver cross to me.</p><p>\"Gavner, Gavner, Gavner.\" Mr. Crepsley sighed. \"I always could hear you coming from half a mile away.\"</p><p>\"Not true!\" the voice said resentfully, as the blade drew back from my throat. \"You couldn't have heard.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Nobody in the world breathes as heavily as you. I could pick you out blindfolded in a crowd of thousands.\"</p><p>\"One night, Larten,\" the stranger muttered. \"One night I'll surprise you. We'll see how smart you are then.\"</p><p>\"Upon that night I shall retire in disgrace.\" Mr. Crepsley chuckled.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley cocked an eyebrow at me, amused to see I was still stiff and half afraid, even though I'd figured out our lives weren't in danger.</p><p>\"Shame on you, Gavner Purl,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"You have frightened the boy.\"</p><p>\"Seems all I'm good for.\" The stranger grunted. \"Scaring children and little old ladies.\"</p><p>Turning slowly, I came face to face with the man called Gavner Purl. He wasn't very tall, but he was wide, built like a wrestler. His face was a mass of scars and dark patches, and the rims around his eyes were extremely black. His brown hair was cut short, and he was dressed in an ordinary pair of jeans and a baggy white shirt. He had a broad smile and glittering yellow teeth.</p><p>It was only when I glanced down at his fingertips and spotted ten scars that I realized he was a vampire. That's how most vampires are created: vampire blood is pumped into them through the soft flesh at the ends of their fingers.</p><p>\"Darren, this is Gavner Purl,\" Mr. Crepsley introduced us. \"An old, trusted, rather clumsy friend. Gavner, this is Darren Shan.\"</p><p>\"Pleased to meet you,\" the vampire said, shaking my hand. \" Youdidn't hear me coming, did you?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I answered honestly.</p><p>\"There!\" he boomed proudly. \"See?\"</p><p>\"Congratulations,\" Mr. Crepsley said dryly. \"If you are ever called upon to sneak into a nursery, you should have no problems.\"</p><p>Gavner grimaced. \"I see time hasn't sweetened you,\" he noted. \"As cutting as ever. How long has it been? Fourteen years? Fifteen?\"</p><p>\"Seventeen next February,\" Mr. Crepsley answered promptly.</p><p>\"Seventeen!\" Gavner whistled. \"Longer than I thought. Seventeen years and as sour as ever.\" He nudged me in the ribs. \"Does he still complain like a grumpy old woman when he wakes up?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I giggled.</p><p>\"I could never get a positive word out of him until midnight. I had to share a coffin with him once for four whole months.\" He shivered at the memory. \"Longest four months of my life.\"</p><p>\"You shared a coffin?\" I asked in awe.</p><p>\"Had to,\" he said. \"We were being hunted. We had to stick together. I wouldn't do it again, though. I'd rather face the sun and burn.\"</p><p>\"You were not the only one with cause for complaint.\" Mr. Crepsley grunted. \"Your snoring nearly drove me to face the sun myself.\" His lips were twitching, and I could tell he was having a hard time not smiling.</p><p>\"Why were you being hunted?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Never mind,\" Mr. Crepsley snapped before Gavner could answer, then glared at his ex-partner.</p><p>Gavner made a face. \"It was nearly sixty years ago, Larten,\" he said. \"I didn't realize it was classified information.\"</p><p>\"The boy is not interested in the past,\" Mr. Crepsley said firmly. (I most certainly was!) \"You are on my soil, Gavner Purl. I would ask you to respect my wishes.\"</p><p>\"Stuffy old bat,\" Gavner grumbled, but he gave in with a nod of his head. \"So, Darren,\" he said, \"what do you do at the Cirque Du Freak?\"</p><p>\"Odd jobs,\" I told him. \"I gather food for the Little People and help the performers get ready for -?</p><p>\"The Little People still travel with the Cirque?\" Gavner interrupted.</p><p>\"More of them than ever,\" Mr. Crepsley answered. \"There are twenty with us at the moment.\"</p><p>The vampires shared a knowing glance but said no more about it. I could tell Gavner was troubled by the way his scars knit together into a fierce-looking frown.</p><p>\"How goes it with the Generals?\" Mr. Crepsley enquired.</p><p>\"Usual old routine,\" Gavner said.</p><p>\"Gavner is a Vampire General,\" Mr. Crepsley told me. That sparked my interest. I'd heard of the Vampire Generals, but nobody had told me exactly who or what they were.</p><p>\"Excuse me,\" I said, \"but what's a Vampire General? What do they do?\"</p><p>\"We keep an eye on scoundrels like this,\" Gavner laughed, nudging Mr. Crepsley. \"We make sure they're not up to mischief.\"</p><p>\"The Vampire Generals monitor the behavior of the vampire clan,\" Mr. Crepsley added. \"They make sure none of us kill innocents or use our powers for evil.\"</p><p>\"How do they do that?\" I asked.</p><p>\"If they discover a vampire who has turned bad,\" Mr. Crepsley said, \"they kill him.\"</p><p>\"Oh.\" I stared at Gavner Purl. He didn't look like a killer, but then again, there were all those scars...</p><p>\"It's a boring job most of the time,\" Gavner said. \"I'm more like a village policeman than a soldier. I never did like the term 'Vampire Generals. Far too pompous.\"</p><p>\"It is not just evil vampires that Generals clamp down on,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"It is also their business to crack down on foolish or weak vampires.\" He sighed. \"I have been expecting this visit. Shall we retire to my tent, Gavner, to discuss the matter?\"</p><p>\"You've been expecting me?\" Gavner looked startled.</p><p>\"Word was bound to leak out sooner or later,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"I have made no attempt to hide the boy or suppress the truth. Note that please: I will use it during my trial, when I am called upon to defend myself.\"</p><p>\"Trial? Truth? The boy?\" Gavner was bewildered. Glancing down at my hands, he spotted the vampire marks on my fingertips and his jaw dropped. \"The boy's a vampire?\" he shrieked.</p><p>\"Of course,\" Mr. Crepsley frowned. \"But surely you knew.\"</p><p>\"I knew nothing of the kind!\" Gavner protested. He looked into my eyes and concentrated hard. \"The blood is weak in him,\" he mused aloud. \"He is only a half-vampire.\"</p><p>\"Naturally,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"It is not our custom to make full vampires of our assistants.\"</p><p>\"Nor to make assistants of children!\" Gavner Purl snapped, sounding more authoritative than he had before. \"What were you thinking?\" he asked Mr. Crep-sley. \"A boy! When did this happen? Why haven't you informed anybody?\"</p><p>\"It has been nearly a year and a half since I blooded Darren,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Why I did it is a long story. As for why I have not yet told anyone, that is simpler to answer: you are the first of our kind we have encountered. I would have taken him to the next Council if I had not run into a General beforehand. Now that will not be necessary.\"</p><p>\"It certainly will be!\" Gavner snorted.</p><p>\"Why?\" Mr. Crepsley asked. \"You can judge my actions and pass verdict.\"</p><p>\"Me? Judge you?\" Gavner laughed. \"No thanks. I'll leave you to the Council. The last thing I need is to get involved in something like this.\"</p><p>\"Excuse me,\" I said again, \"but what's this all about? Why are you talking about being judged? And who or what is the Council?\"</p><p>\"I shall tell you later,\" Mr. Crepsley said, waving my questions aside. He studied Gavner curiously. \"If you are not here about the boy, why have you come? I thought I made it clear when last we met that I wanted no more to do with the Generals.\"</p><p>\"You made it crystal clear,\" Gavner agreed. \"Maybe I'm just here to discuss old times.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley smiled cynically. \"After seventeen years of leaving me to my own devices? I think not, Gavner.\"</p><p>The Vampire General coughed discreetly. \"There is trouble brewing. Nothing to do with the Generals,\" he added quickly. \"This is personal. I've come because I feel there's something you should know.\" He paused.</p><p>\"Go on,\" Mr. Crepsley urged him.</p><p>Gavner looked at me and cleared his throat. \"I have no objections to speaking in front of Darren,\" he said, \"but you seemed anxious to steer him clear of certain areas when we were discussing our past a while ago. What I have to tell you may not be for his ears.\"</p><p>\"Darren,\" Mr. Crepsley said immediately, \"Gavner and I shall continue our discussion in my quarters, alone. Please find Mr. Tall and tell him I shall be unable to perform tonight.\"</p><p>I wasn't happy - I wanted to hear what Gavner had to say. He was the first vampire I'd met other than Mr. Crepsley - but from his stern expression, I knew his mind was made up. I turned to leave.</p><p>\"And Darren,\" Mr. Crepsley called back. \"I know you are curious by nature, but I warn you: do not attempt to eavesdrop. I shall take a dim view of it if you do.\"</p><p>\"What do you think I am?\" I said. \"You treat me like -?</p><p>\"Darren!\" he snapped. \"No eavesdropping!\"</p><p>I nodded glumly. \"All right.\"</p><p>\"Cheer up,\" Gavner Purl said as I walked away dejectedly. \"I'll tell you all about it, as soon as Larten's back is turned.\"</p><p>As Mr. Crepsley spun around, with fire in his eyes, the Vampire General quickly raised his hands and laughed. \"Only joking!\"</p><p>Chapter THREE</p><p>I decided to do the act with Madam Octa - Mr. Crepsley's spider - by myself. I was totally able to handle her. Besides, it was fun to take over from Mr. Crepsley. I'd been on stage with him a bunch of times, but always as his sidekick.</p><p>I went on after Hans Hands - a man who could run a hundred yards on his hands in less that eight seconds - and had great fun. The audience cheered, and later I sold a bunch of candy spiders to clamoring customers.</p><p>I hung out with Evra after the show. I told him about Gavner Purl and asked what he knew about Vampire Generals.</p><p>\"Not much,\" he said. \"I know they exist, but I've never met one.\"</p><p>\"What about the Council?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I think that's a huge meeting they have every ten or fifteen years,\" he said. \"A big conference where they get together and discuss things.\"</p><p>That was all he could tell me.</p><p>A few hours before dawn, while Evra was tending to his snake, Gavner Purl appeared from Mr. Crepsley's van - the vampire preferred to sleep in the basements of buildings, but there had been no suitable rooms in the old mill - and asked me to walk with him awhile.</p><p>The Vampire General walked slowly, rubbing the scars on his face, like Mr. Crepsley did a lot when he was thinking.</p><p>\"Do you enjoy being a half-vampire, Darren?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Not really,\" I answered honestly. \"I've gotten used to it, but I was happier as a human.\"</p><p>He nodded. \"You know that you will age at only a fifth of the human rate? You've resigned yourself to a long childhood? It doesn't bother you?\"</p><p>\"It bothers me,\" I said. \"I used to look forward to growing up. It bugs me that it's going to take so long. But there's nothing I can do about it. I'm stuck, aren't I?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" he sighed. \"That's the problem with blooding a person: there's no way to take the vampire blood back. It's why we don't blood children: we only want people who know what they're getting into, who wish to abandon their humanity. Larten shouldn't have blooded you. It was a mistake.\"</p><p>\"Is that why he was talking about being judged?\" I asked.</p><p>Gavner nodded. \"He'll have to account for his error,\" he said. \"He'll have to convince the Generals and Princes that what he did won't harm them. If he can't...\" Gavner looked grim.</p><p>\"Will he be killed?\" I asked softly.</p><p>Gavner smiled. \"I doubt it. Larten is widely respected. His wrists will be slapped, but I don't think anybody will look for his head.\"</p><p>\"Why didn't you judge him?\" I asked.</p><p>\"All Generals have the right to pass judgment on nonranked vampires,\" he said. \"But Larten's an old friend. It's best for a judge to be unbiased. Even if he'd committed a real crime, I would have found it hard to punish him. Besides, Larten's no ordinary vampire. He used to be a General.\"</p><p>\"Really?\" I stared at Gavner Purl, stunned by the news.</p><p>\"An important one, too,\" Gavner said. \"He was on the verge of being voted a Vampire Prince when he stepped down.\"</p><p>\"A prince?\" I asked skeptically. It was hard to imagine Mr. Crepsley with a crown and royal cape.</p><p>\"That's what we call our leaders,\" Gavner said. \"There are very few of them. Only the noblest and most respected vampires are elected.\"</p><p>\"And Mr. Crepsley almost became one?\" I said. Gavner nodded. \"What happened?\" I asked. \"How did he end up traveling with the Cirque Du Freak?\"</p>","<p>\"He resigned,\" Gavner said. \"He was a couple of years shy of being ordained - we call the process of Prince-making an ordination - when one night he declared he was sick of the business and wanted nothing more to do with the Generals.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" I asked.</p><p>Gavner shrugged. \"Nobody knows. Larten never gave much away. Maybe he just got tired of the fighting and killing.\"</p><p>I wanted to ask who it was the Vampire Generals had to fight, but at that moment we passed the last of the town houses and Gavner Purl smiled and stretched his arms.</p><p>\"A clear run.\" He grunted happily.</p><p>\"You're leaving?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Have to,\" he said. \"A General's schedule is a busy one. I only dropped by because it was on my way. I'd like to stay and chat over old times with Larten, but I can't. Anyway, I think Larten will be on the move soon himself.\"</p><p>My ears perked up. \"Where's he going?\" I asked.</p><p>Gavner shook his head and grinned. \"Sorry. He'd scalp me alive if I told. I've already said more than I should. You won't tell him I told you about his being a General, will you?\"</p><p>\"Not if you don't want me to,\" I said.</p><p>\"Thanks.\" Gavner crouched down and faced me. \"Larten's a pain in the butt sometimes. He plays his cards too close to his chest, and getting information out of him can be like prying teeth from a shark. But he's a good vampire, one of the best. You couldn't hope for a better teacher. Trust him, Darren, and you won't go wrong.\"</p><p>\"I'll try.\" I smiled.</p><p>\"This can be a dangerous world for vampires,\" Gavner said softly. \"More dangerous than you know. Stick with Larten and you'll be in a better position to survive than many of our kind. You don't live as long as he has without learning more than your fair share of tricks.\"</p><p>\"How old is she?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I'm not sure,\" Gavner said. \"I think about a hundred and eighty or two hundred.\"</p><p>\"How old are you?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I'm a whippersnapper,\" he said. \"Barely past the hundred mark.\"</p><p>\"A hundred years old!\" I whistled softly.</p><p>\"That's nothing for a vampire,\" Gavner said. \"I was barely nineteen when first blooded and only twenty-two when I became a full vampire. I could live to be a good five hundred years old, the gods of the vampires permitting.\"</p><p>\"Five hundred!\" I couldn't imagine being so old.</p><p>\"Picture trying to blow out the candles on that cake!\" Gavner chuckled. Then he stood. \"I must be off. I have fifty miles to make before dawn. I'll have to slip into overdrive.\" He grimaced. \"I hate flitting. I always feel sick afterward.\"</p><p>\"Will I see you again?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Probably,\" he replied. \"The world's a small place. I'm sure our paths will cross again one fine, gloomy night.\" He shook my hand. \"So long, Darren Shan.\"</p><p>\"Until next time, Gavner Purl,\" I said.</p><p>\"Next time,\" he agreed, and then he was off. He took several deep breaths and started to jog. After a while he broke into a sprint. I stood where I was, watching him run, until he hit flitting speed and disappeared in the blink of an eye, at which point I turned and headed back to camp.</p><p>I found Mr. Crepsley in his van. He was sitting by the window (it was completely covered with strips of dark sticky tape, to block out the sun during the day), staring moodily off into space.</p><p>\"Gavner's gone,\" I said.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he sighed.</p><p>\"He didn't stay long,\" I remarked.</p><p>\"He is a Vampire General,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"His time is not his own.\"</p><p>\"I liked him.\"</p><p>\"He is a fine vampire and a good friend,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed.</p><p>I cleared my throat. \"He said you might be leaving, too.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley regarded me suspiciously. \"What else did he say?\"</p><p>\"Nothing,\" I lied quickly. \"I asked why he couldn't stay longer, and he said there was no point, since you'd probably be moving on soon.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley nodded. \"Gavner brought unpleasant news,\" he said carefully. \"I will have to leave the Cirque for a while.\"</p><p>\"Where are you going?\" I asked.</p><p>\"To a city,\" he responded vaguely.</p><p>\"What about me?\" I asked.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley scratched his scar thoughtfully. \"That is what I have been contemplating,\" he said. \"I would prefer not to take you with me, but I think I must. I may have need of you.\"</p><p>\"But I like it here,\" I complained. \"I don't want to leave.\"</p><p>\"Nor do I,\" Mr. Crepsley snapped. \"But I must. And you have to come with me. Remember: we are vampires, not circus performers. The Cirque Du Freak is a means of cover, not our home.\"</p><p>\"How long will we be away?\" I asked unhappily.</p><p>\"Days. Weeks. Months. I cannot say for sure.\"</p><p>\"What if I refuse to come?\"</p><p>He studied me ominously. \"An assistant who does not obey orders has no purpose,\" he said quietly. \"If I cannot rely on your cooperation, I will have to take steps to remove you from my employ.\"</p><p>\"You mean you'd fire me?\" I smiled bitterly.</p><p>\"There is only one way to deal with a rebellious half-vampire,\" he answered, and I knew what that way was - a stake through the heart!</p><p>\"It's not fair,\" I grumbled. \"What am I going to do by myself all day in a strange city while you're asleep?\"</p><p>\"What did you do when you were a human?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Things were different,\" I said. \"I had friends and a family. I'm going to be alone again if we leave, like when I first joined up with you.\"</p><p>\"It will be hard,\" Mr. Crepsley said compassionately, \"but we have no choice. I must be away with the coming of dusk - I would leave now, were we not so near to dawn - and you must come with me. There is no other...\"</p><p>He stopped as a thought struck him. \"Of course,\" he said slowly, \"we could bring another along.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I asked.</p><p>\"We could take Evra with us.\"</p><p>I frowned as I considered it.</p><p>\"The two of you are good friends, yes?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said, \"but I don't know how he'd feel about leaving. And there's his snake. What would we do with that?\"</p><p>\"I am sure somebody could look after the snake,\" Mr. Crepsley said, warming to the idea. \"Evra would be good company for you. And he is wiser: he could keep you out of mischief when I am not around.\"</p><p>\"I don't need a baby-sitter!\" I huffed.</p><p>\"No,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed, \"but a guardian would not go amiss. You have a habit of getting into trouble when left to your own devices. Remember when you stole Madam Octa? And the mess we had with that human boy, Sam whatever his name was?\"</p><p>\"That wasn't my fault!\" I yelled.</p><p>\"Indeed not,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"But it happened when you were by yourself.\"</p><p>I made a face but didn't say anything.</p><p>\"Will I ask him or not?\" Mr. Crepsley pressed the issue.</p><p>\" I'llask him,\" I said. \"You'd probably bully him into going.\"</p><p>\"Have it your own way.\" Mr. Crepsley rose. \"I will go and clear it with Hibernius.\" That was Mr. Tail's first name. \"Be back here before dawn so I can brief you - I want to make sure we are prepared to travel as soon as night falls.\"</p><p>Evra took a lot of time deciding. He didn't like the idea of parting company with his friends in the Cirque Du Freak - or with his snake.</p><p>\"It won't be forever,\" I told him.</p><p>\"I know,\" he said uncertainly.</p><p>\"Look at it as a vacation,\" I suggested.</p><p>\"I like the idea of a vacation,\" he admitted. \"But it would be nice to know where I was going.\"</p><p>\"Sometimes surprises are more fun,\" I said.</p><p>\"And sometimes they aren't,\" Evra muttered.</p><p>\"Mr. Crepsley will be asleep all day,\" I reminded him. \"We'll be free to do whatever we want. We can go sightseeing, to the movies, swimming, anything we want.\"</p><p>\"I've never been swimming,\" Evra said, and I could tell by the way he grinned that he'd decided to come.</p><p>\"I'll tell Mr. Tall you're coming?\" I asked. \"And get him to have someone take care of your snake?\"</p><p>Evra nodded. \"She doesn't like the cold weather in any case,\" he said. \"She'll be asleep most of the winter.\"</p><p>\"Great!\" I grinned. \"We'll have a blast.\"</p><p>\"We'd better,\" he said, \"or it'll be the last time I go on 'vacation' with you.\"</p><p>I spent the rest of the day packing and unpacking. I only had two small bags to bring, one for me and one for Mr. Crepsley, but - apart from my diary, which went everywhere with me - I kept changing my mind about what to bring.</p><p>Then I remembered Madam Octa - I wasn't bringing her along - and hurried off to find somebody to look after her. Hans Hands agreed to watch her, although he said there was no way he'd let her out of her cage.</p><p>Finally, after hours of running around - Mr. Crepsley had it easy, the wily old goat! - night came and it was time to leave.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley checked the bags and nodded stiffly. I told him about leaving Madam Octa with Hans Hands and again he nodded. \"We picked up Evra, said good-bye to Mr. Tall and some of the others, then turned away from the camp and began walking.</p><p>\"Will you be able to carry both of us when you flit?\" I asked Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>\"I have no intention of flitting,\" he said.</p><p>\"Then how are we going to travel?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Buses and trains,\" he replied. He laughed when I looked surprised. \"Vampires can use public transportation as well as humans. There are no laws against it.\"</p><p>\"I suppose not,\" I said, grinning, wondering what other passengers would think if they knew they were traveling with a vampire, a half-vampire, and a snake-boy. \"Should we go then?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Mr. Crepsley answered simply, and the three of us headed into town to catch the first train out.</p><p>Chapter FOUR</p><p>It felt strange being in a city. The noise and smell almost drove me crazy the first couple of days: with my heightened senses it was like being in the middle of a whirring blender. I lay in bed during the daytime, covering my head with the thickest pillow I could find. But by the end of the week I'd grown used to the supersharp sounds and scents and learned to ignore them.</p><p>We stayed at a hotel located in the corner of a quiet city square. In the evenings, when traffic was slow, neighborhood kids gathered outside for a game of soccer. I would have loved to join in but didn't dare - with my extra strength, I might accidentally end up breaking somebody's bones, or worse.</p><p>By the start of our second week, we'd fallen into a comfortable routine. Evra and me woke up every morning - Mr. Crepsley went off by himself at night without telling us where - and ate a big breakfast. After that we'd head out and explore the city, which was big and old and full of interesting stuff. We'd get back to the hotel at nightfall, in case Mr. Crepsley wanted us, then watch some TV or play computer games. We usually got to bed between eleven and twelve.</p><p>After a year with the Cirque Du Freak, it was a thrill to live like a normal human again. I loved being able to sleep late in the morning, not having to worry about finding food for the Little People; it was great not to be rushing around, running errands for the performers; and sitting back at night, stuffing my face with candy and pickled onions and watching TV - that was the best!</p><p>Evra was enjoying himself, too. He'd never known a life like this. He'd been part of the circus world for as long as he could remember, first with a nasty sideshow owner, then with Mr. Tall. He liked the Cirque - I did, too - and was looking forward to returning, but he had to admit it was nice to have a break.</p><p>\"I never realized TV could be so addictive,\" he said one night, after we'd watched five shows in a row.</p><p>\"My mom and dad never let me watch too much,\" I told him, \"but I knew guys in school who watched five or six hours of it every night of the week!\"</p><p>\"I wouldn't take it that far,\" Evra mused, \"but it's fun in small doses. Maybe I'll buy a portable TV when we get back to the Cirque Du Freak.\"</p><p>\"I never thought of getting a TV since I joined,\" I said. \"So much else was going on, it was the last thing on my mind. But you're right - it would be nice to have a TV, even if we could only watch reruns of The Simpsons.\" That was our favorite show.</p><p>I wondered sometimes what Mr. Crepsley was up to - he'd always been mysterious, but never this secretive - but in truth I wasn't overly bothered: it was nice to have him out of my hair.</p><p>Evra had to wrap up in layers of clothes whenever we went out. Not because of the cold - though it was chilly: the first snow had fallen a couple of days after our arrival - but because of how he looked. Although he didn't mind people staring at him - he was used to it - it was easier to get around if he was able to pass for a normal human. That way he didn't have to stop every five or ten minutes to explain to a curious stranger who and what he was.</p><p>Covering his body, legs, and arms was easy - pants, a sweatshirt, and gloves - but his face was tricky: it wasn't as heavily scaled or colored as the rest of him, but it wasn't the face of an ordinary human. A big baseball hat took care of his long yellow-green hair, and dark glasses shaded a lot of the upper half of his face. But as for the lower half...</p><p>We experimented with bandages and flesh-colored paints before hitting on the answer: a fake beard! We bought it in a joke shop, and although it looked silly - nobody would mistake it for a real one - it did the job.</p>","<p>\"We must look like quite a pair,\" Evra said with a giggle one day as we strolled around a zoo. \"You in your pirate costume, me in this getup. People probably think we're a couple of escaped crazies.\"</p><p>\"The people at the hotel definitely do.\" I giggled. \"I've heard the bellboys and maids talking about us - they think Mr. Crepsley is a mad doctor and we're two of his patients.\"</p><p>\"Yeah?\" Evra laughed. \"Imagine if they knew the truth - that you're a couple of vampires and I'm a snake-boy!\"</p><p>\"I don't think it would matter,\" I said. Mr. Crepsley tips well, and that's the important thing. 'Money buys privacy, as I heard one of the managers say when a maid was complaining about a guy who'd been walking around na**d in the corridors.\"</p><p>\"I saw him!\" Evra exclaimed. \"I thought he locked himself out of his room.\"</p><p>\"Nope,\" I smiled. \"Apparently he's been walking around like that for four or five days. According to the manager, he comes every year for a couple of weeks and spends the entire time roaming around na**d as a baby.\"</p><p>\"They let him?\" Evra asked in awe.</p><p>\" 'Money buys privacy, \" I repeated.</p><p>\"And I thought the Cirque Du Freak was a strange place to live,\" Evra muttered wryly. \"Humans are even weirder than us!\"</p><p>As the days passed, the city became more and more Christmasy as people geared themselves up for the twenty-fifth of December. Christmas trees appeared; lights and decorations lit up the streets and windows each night; Father Christmas touched down and took orders; toys of every shape and size filled store shelves from floor to ceiling.</p><p>I was looking forward to Christmas: last year's had passed unnoticed, since Christmas was something hardly anyone associated with the Cirque Du Freak bothered celebrating.</p><p>Evra couldn't understand what the fuss was about.</p><p>\"What's the point of it?\" he kept asking. \"People spend a bunch of money buying each other presents they don't really need; they drive themselves half-crazy getting a big dinner ready; trees and turkey are bred and slaughtered in huge numbers. It's ridiculous!\"</p><p>I tried telling him that it was a day of peace and goodwill, when families come together and rejoice, but he wouldn't listen. As far as he was concerned, it was a crazy money-making racket.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley, of course, only snorted whenever the subject was brought up. \"A silly human custom,\" was how he put it. He didn't want anything to do with the festival.</p><p>It would be a lonely Christmas without my family - I missed them more at this time of the year than ever, especially Annie - but at the same time, I was looking forward to it. The hotel staff were throwing a big party for the guests. There'd be turkey and ham and Christmas cake and cookies. I was determined to make Evra get some Christmas spirit: I was sure he'd change his opinion when he experienced Christmas firsthand.</p><p>\"Want to come shopping?\" I asked one frosty afternoon, wrapping a scarf around my neck (I didn't need it - my vampire blood kept me warm - or the thick coat or heavy sweatshirt, but I'd draw attention if I went out without them).</p><p>Evra glanced out the window. It had been snowing earlier and the world outside was frosty-white.</p><p>\"Nah,\" he said. \"I don't feel like getting into heavy clothes again.\" We'd been out that morning, throwing snowballs at each other.</p><p>\"Okay,\" I said, glad he wasn't coming: I wanted to look over a few presents for him. \"I won't be more than an hour or two.\"</p><p>\"Will you be back before dark?\" Evra asked.</p><p>\"Maybe,\" I said.</p><p>\"You'd better be.\" He nodded toward the room where Mr. Crepsley lay sleeping. \"You know how it goes: the one night you aren't here when he wakes will be the one night he wants you.\"</p><p>I laughed. \"I'll risk it. Want me to bring you back anything?\" Evra shook his head. \"Okay. See you soon.\"</p><p>I walked through the snow, whistling to myself. I liked snow: it covered up most of the smells and muffled a lot of the noise. Some of the kids who lived in the square were out building a snowman. I stopped to watch them but moved on before they could ask me to join in: it was easier not to get involved with humans.</p><p>As I stood outside a large department store, studying the window display, wondering what to buy Evra, a girl walked over and stood beside me. She was dark-skinned, with long black hair. She looked about my age and was a little shorter than me.</p><p>\"Ahoy, cap'n,\" she said, saluting.</p><p>\"Excuse me?\" I replied, startled.</p><p>\"The costume,\" she grinned, tugging my coat open. \"I think it's cool, you look like a pirate. You going in or just looking?\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" I said. \"I'm looking for a present for my brother, but I'm not sure what to get him.\" That was our story - that Evra and me were brothers, and Mr. Crepsley was our father.</p><p>\"Oh.\" She nodded. \"How old is he?\"</p><p>\"A year older than me,\" I said.</p><p>\"Aftershave,\" she said firmly.</p><p>I shook my head. \"He hasn't started shaving yet.\" And never would: hairs wouldn't grow on Evra's scales.</p><p>\"Okay,\" she said. \"How about a CD?\"</p><p>\"He doesn't listen to much music,\" I said. \"Although if I got him a CD player, he might start.\"</p><p>\"Those are expensive,\" the girl said.</p><p>\"He's my only brother,\" I said. \"He's worth it.\"</p><p>\"Then go for it.\" She held out a hand. She wasn't wearing gloves, despite the cold. \"My name's Debbie.\"</p><p>I shook her hand - mine looked very white compared with her dark skin - and told her my name.</p><p>\"Darren and Debbie.\" She smiled. \"That sounds good, like Bonnie and Clyde.\"</p><p>\"Do you always talk to strangers like this?\" I asked.</p><p>\"No,\" she said. \"But we're not strangers.\"</p><p>\"We're not?\" I frowned.</p><p>\"I've seen you around,\" she said. \"I live in the square, a few doors up from the hotel. That's how I knew about the pirate costume. You hang out with that funny guy in glasses and a fake beard.\"</p><p>\"Evra. He's the one I'm buying the present for.\" I tried placing her face but couldn't remember seeing her with the other kids. \"I haven't noticed you around,\" I said.</p><p>\"I haven't been out much,\" she replied. \"I've been in bed with a cold. That's why I spotted you - I've been spending my days staring out the window, studying the square. Life gets really boring when you're stuck in bed.\"</p><p>Debbie blew into her hands and rubbed them together.</p><p>\"You should be wearing gloves,\" I told her.</p><p>\"Look who's talking.\" She sniffed. I'd forgotten to put on a pair before leaving. \"Anyway, that's what I'm here for - I lost my gloves earlier and I've been roaming around from store to store trying to find an identical pair. I don't want my parents to find out I lost them on only my second day out of bed.\"</p><p>\"What were they like?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Red, with fake fur around the wrists,\" she said. \"My uncle gave them to me a few months ago but didn't say where he got them.\"</p><p>\"Have you tried this place yet?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Uh-uh,\" she said. \"I was on my way in when I spotted you.\"</p><p>\"Want to come in with me?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Sure,\" she said. \"I hate shopping by myself. I'll help you choose a CD player if you want. I know a lot about them.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" I said, then pushed the door open and held it for her.</p><p>\"Why, Darren,\" she said with a laugh, \"people will think you have a crush on me.\"</p><p>I felt myself blushing and tried to think of an okay response - but couldn't. Debbie giggled, walked in, and left me to trail along behind her.</p><p>Chapter FIVE</p><p>Debbie's last name was Hemlock, and she hated it.</p><p>\"Imagine being named after a poisonous plant!\" she fumed.</p><p>\"It's not that bad,\" I said. \"I kind of like it.\"</p><p>\"Shows what kind of taste you have,\" she scoffed.</p><p>Debbie had only recently moved here with her parents. She had no brothers or sisters. Her dad was a computer whiz who regularly flew around the world on business. They'd moved five times since she was born.</p><p>She was interested to learn that I was also used to moving around. I didn't tell her about the Cirque Du Freak, but said I was on the road a lot with my dad, who was a traveling salesman.</p><p>Debbie wanted to know why she hadn't seen my father in the square. \"I've seen you and your brother lots of times, but never your dad.\"</p><p>\"He's an early riser,\" I lied. \"He gets up before dawn and doesn't come back until after dark most days.\"</p><p>\"He leaves the two of you alone in the hotel?\" She pursed her lips as she thought about it. \"What about school?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Are these like the gloves you want?\" I avoided the question, picking a pair of red gloves off a rack.</p><p>\"Almost,\" she said, studying them. \"Mine were a shade darker.\"</p><p>We went on to another store and looked at a bunch of CD players. I didn't have much money on me, so I didn't buy anything.</p><p>\"Of course, after Christmas they'll be on sale,\" Debbie sighed, \"but what can you do? If you wait, you'll look mean.\"</p><p>\"I'm not worried about the money,\" I said. I could always get some from Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>After failing to find the right kind of gloves in another couple of stores, we walked around for a while, watching the lights come on above the streets and in the windows.</p><p>\"I love this time of evening,\" Debbie said. \"It's like one city goes to sleep and a new one wakes up.\"</p><p>\"A city of nightwalkers,\" I said, thinking of Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>\"Hmmm,\" she said, looking at me suspiciously. \"Where are you from? I can't place your accent.\"</p><p>\"Here and there,\" I answered vaguely. \"Around and about.\"</p><p>\"You're not going to tell me, are you?\" she asked directly.</p><p>\"My dad doesn't like me telling people,\" I said.</p><p>\"Why not?\" she challenged me.</p><p>\"Can't tell you.\" I grinned weakly.</p><p>\"Hmmm,\" she grunted, but let the matter drop. \"What's your hotel like?\" she asked. \"It looks kind of stuffy. Is it?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said. \"It's better than most places I've been. The staff don't hassle you if you play in the corridors. And some of the customers...\" I told her about the guy who walked around nude.</p><p>\"No!\" she squealed. \"You're kidding!\"</p><p>\"Honest,\" I swore.</p><p>\"They don't kick him out?\"</p><p>\"He's paying. As far as they're concerned, he has the right to walk around however he pleases.\"</p><p>\"I'll have to come over sometime.\" She grinned.</p><p>\"Whenever you like,\" I said, smiling. \"Except during the day,\" I added quickly, remembering the slumbering Mr. Crepsley. The last thing I wanted was for Debbie to walk in on a vampire while he was sleeping.</p><p>We headed back for the square, taking our time. I liked being with Debbie. I knew I shouldn't be making friends with humans - it was too dangerous - but it was hard to reject her. I hadn't been around anyone my own age, except Evra, since becoming a half-vampire.</p><p>\"What will you tell your parents about the gloves?\" I asked as we stood on the front step of her house.</p><p>She shrugged. \"The truth. I'll start coughing when I tell them. Hopefully they'll feel sorry for me and won't get too mad.\"</p><p>\"You're bad.\" I laughed.</p><p>\"With a name like Hemlock, are you surprised?\" She smiled, then asked, \"Do you want to come in for a while?\"</p><p>I checked my watch. Mr. Crepsley would be up by now and had probably already left the hotel. I didn't like the idea of leaving Evra alone too long: he might get annoyed if he thought I was neglecting him and decide to return to the Cirque Du Freak. \"Better not,\" I said. \"It's late. I'm expected back.\"</p><p>\"Suit yourself,\" Debbie said. \"Feel free to come over tomorrow if you want. Anytime. I'll be in.\"</p><p>\"Won't you be at school?\" I asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \"With the holidays so close, Mom said I don't have to go back until the New Year.\"</p><p>\"But she let you out to look for gloves?\"</p><p>Debbie bit her lip with embarrassment. \"She doesn't know I've been out walking,\" she admitted. \"I left in a taxi, telling her I was going to see a friend. I was supposed to come back in a taxi, too.\"</p><p>\"Aha!\" I smiled. \"Now I can blackmail you.\"</p><p>\"Just try it!\" She snorted. \"I'll cook up a witch's brew and turn you into a frog.\" She fished a key out of her purse and paused. \"You will come over, won't you? It gets pretty dull by myself. I haven't made many friends here yet.\"</p><p>\"I don't mind coming,\" I said, \"but how will you explain me to your mother? You can't exactly tell her we met in a taxi.\"</p><p>\"You're right.\" Her eyes narrowed. \"I didn't think of that.\"</p><p>\"I'm not just a pretty face,\" I said jokingly.</p><p>\"Not even a pretty face!\" She laughed. \"How about I come over to the hotel?\" she suggested. \"We can go on to the movies from there, and I can tell Mom that's where we met.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" I said, and told her my room number. \"But not too early,\" I warned. \"Wait until five or six, when it's pretty dark.\"</p>","<p>\"Okay.\" She tapped her foot on the doorstep. \" Well?\" she said.</p><p>\"Well what?\" I replied.</p><p>\"Aren't you going to ask?\"</p><p>\"Ask what?\"</p><p>\"Ask me to go to a movie,\" she said.</p><p>\"But you just -?</p><p>\"Darren,\" she sighed. \"Girls never ask boys out.\"</p><p>\"They don't?\" I was confused.</p><p>\"You're clueless, aren't you?\" She chuckled. \"Just ask me if I want to go to the movies, okay?\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" I groaned. \"Debbie - will you come to the movies with me?\"</p><p>\"I'll think about it,\" she said, then unlocked the door and disappeared inside.</p><p>Girls!</p><p>Chapter SIX</p><p>Evra was watching TV when I got in. \"Any news?\" I asked.</p><p>\"No,\" he replied.</p><p>\"Mr. Crepsley didn't miss me?\"</p><p>\"He barely noticed you were gone. He's been acting weird lately.\"</p><p>\"I know,\" I said. \"I need a feed of human blood, but he hasn't mentioned it. Normally he's pretty fussy about making sure I feed on time.\"</p><p>\"Are you going to feed without him?\" Evra asked.</p><p>\"Probably. I'll slip into one of the rooms late tonight and take some blood from a sleeping guest. I'll use a syringe.\" I wasn't able to close cuts with spit like full vampires could.</p><p>I'd come a long way in a year. Not so long ago, I would have jumped at the chance to skip a feed; now I was feeding because I wanted to, not because I'd been told.</p><p>\"You'd better be careful,\" Evra warned me. \"If you get caught, Mr. Crepsley will have a fit.\"</p><p>\"Caught? Me? Impossible! I'll breeze in and out like a ghost.\"</p><p>I did, too, at about two in the morning. It was easy for someone with my talents: by sticking an ear to a door and listening for sounds inside, I could tell how many people were in a room and whether they were light sleepers or deep sleepers. When I found an unlocked room with a single man snoring like a bear, I let myself in and took the required amount of blood. Back in my own room, I squeezed the blood into a glass and drank.</p><p>\"That'll keep me going,\" I said as I finished. \"It'll get me through tomorrow anyway, and that's the important thing.\"</p><p>\"What's so special about tomorrow?\" Evra asked.</p><p>I told him about meeting Debbie and arranging to go to the movies.</p><p>\"You've got a date!\" Evra laughed with delight.</p><p>\"It's not a date!\" I snorted. \"We're just going to the movies.\"</p><p>\" Just?\" Evra grinned. \"There's no such thing as just with girls. It's a date.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" I said, \"it's kind of a date. I'm not stupid. I know I can't get involved.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\" Evra asked.</p><p>\"Because she's a normal girl and I'm only half human,\" I said.</p><p>\"That shouldn't stop you from going out together. She won't be able to tell you're a vampire, not unless you start biting her neck.\"</p><p>\"Ha ha,\" I laughed dryly. \"It's not that. In five years she'll be a grown woman, while I'll still be like this.\"</p><p>Evra shook his head. \"Worry about the next five days,\" he advised, \"not the next five years. You've been hanging around Mr. Crepsley too much - you're getting as gloomy as he is. There's no reason for you not to date girls.\"</p><p>\"I guess you're right.\" I sighed.</p><p>\"Of course I am.\"</p><p>I chewed my lip nervously. \"Assuming it is a date,\" I said, \"what do I do? I've never been on a date before.\"</p><p>Evra shrugged. \"Neither have I. But I guess you fust act normal. Chat with her. Tell her a few jokes. treat her like a friend. Then...\" \" Then?\" I asked when he stopped.</p><p>He puckered up his lips. \"Give her a kiss!\" He laughed.</p><p>I threw a pillow at him. \"I'm sorry I told you,\" I grumbled.</p><p>\"I'm only kidding. But I'll tell you what.\" He turned serious. \" Don'ttell Mr. Crepsley. He'd probably move us on to a new city immediately, or at least a new hotel.\"</p><p>\"You're right,\" I agreed. \"I'll keep quiet about Debbie when he's around. It shouldn't be hard: I barely see him. And when I do, he hardly says anything. He seems like he's in a world of his own.\"</p><p>Although I couldn't have known it then, it was a world me and Evra would soon be part of... and Debbie, too.</p><p>The next day passed slowly. My stomach was a jumble of nerves. I had to drink warm milk to calm it down. Evra didn't help matters. He kept reading the time out loud and announcing: \"Five hours to go!\" \"Four hours to go!\" \"Three and a half...\"</p><p>Luckily I didn't have clothes to worry about: I only had one outfit, so there was no problem choosing what to wear. But I did spend a couple of hours in the bathroom, checking that I was spotlessly clean.</p><p>\"Calm down,\" Evra said eventually. \"You look great. I'm half tempted to go out with you myself.\"</p><p>\"Shut up, stupid,\" I shot back, but couldn't help grinning.</p><p>\"Well, anyway,\" Evra said, \"do you want me to disappear before Debbie arrives?\"</p><p>\"Why?\" I asked.</p><p>\"You might not want me here,\" he muttered.</p><p>\"I want to introduce you to her. She thinks you're my brother. It'd look strange if you weren't here when she shows up.\"</p><p>\"It's just - well - how will you explain?\" Evra asked.</p><p>\"Explain what?\"</p><p>\"My looks,\" he said, rubbing a few of the scales along his arm.</p><p>\"Oh,\" I said, as it finally dawned on me. Debbie didn't know Evra was a snake-boy. She was expecting an ordinary boy.</p><p>\"I might frighten her,\" Evra said. \"Lots of people get scared when they find themselves face to face with a guy like me. Maybe it would be for the best if -?</p><p>\"Listen,\" I said firmly. \"You're my best friend, tight?\"</p><p>\"Right.\" Evra smiled weakly. \"But -?</p><p>\"No!\" I snapped. \"No buts. I like Debbie a lot, but if she can't handle the way you look, too bad.\"</p><p>\"Thanks,\" Evra said quietly.</p><p>Night came and Mr. Crepsley arose. The vampire looked haggard. I'd fixed a meal for him - bacon, sausages, pork chops - so he'd eat quickly and leave before Debbie arrived.</p><p>\"Are you feeling all right?\" I asked as he wolfed down the food.</p><p>\"Fine,\" he mumbled.</p><p>\"You look terrible,\" I told him bluntly. \"Have you fed recently?\"</p><p>He shook his head. \"I have not had time. I may tonight.\"</p><p>\"I took blood from a guest last night,\" I said. \"It'll keep me going for another week or so.\"</p><p>\"Good,\" he said absentmindedly. It was the first time I'd fed by myself, and I'd been expecting some sort of a compliment, but he didn't seem to care. It was like he'd lost interest in me.</p><p>I cleaned up once he'd left, then sat down to watch TV with Evra and wait for Debbie.</p><p>\"She's not going to come,\" I said after what felt like a couple of hours. \"She stood me up.\"</p><p>\"Relax,\" Evra laughed. \"You've only been sitting here ten minutes. It's still early.\"</p><p>I checked my watch - he was right. \"I can't go through with this,\" I groaned. \"I've never been out with a girl before. I'll mess it up. She'll think I'm boring.\"</p><p>\"Don't get so wound up,\" Evra said. \"You want to go out with her, and you are going out with her, so why worry?\"</p><p>I started to answer him, but was interrupted by Debbie knocking on the door. Forgetting my nerves in a second, I jumped up to let her in.</p><p>Chapter SEVEN</p><p>I had expected Debbie to dress up, but she was in a pair of jeans and a baggy sweatshirt, wrapped in a long, heavy coat.</p><p>I noticed she was wearing a pair of red gloves.</p><p>\"You found the gloves?\" I asked.</p><p>She made a face. \"They were in my room all along.\" She groaned. \"They'd fallen behind the radiator. Of course, I only found them after I'd told Mom about walking around outside without them.</p><p>\"Are your father and brother here?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Mr. Cre - I mean, Dad's out. Evra's in.\" I paused. \"There's something you should know about Evra.\" I said.</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"He's not like other people.\"</p><p>\"Who is?\" Debbie laughed.</p><p>\"You see,\" I began to explain, \"Evra's a -?</p><p>\"Look,\" Debbie interrupted, \"I don't care what kind of an odd bod he is. Just take me in and make the introductions.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\" I grinned shakily and gestured for her to enter. Debbie swished confidently ahead of me. A couple of steps into the room, she spotted Evra and stopped.</p><p>\"Wow!\" she exclaimed. \"Is that a costume?\"</p><p>Evra smiled nervously. He was standing in front of the TV, arms crossed stiffly.</p><p>\"Debbie,\" I said, \"this is Evra, my brother. He's -?</p><p>\"Are those scales?\" Debbie asked, surging forward.</p><p>\"Uh-huh,\" Evra said.</p><p>\"Can I touch them?\" Debbie asked.</p><p>\"Sure,\" Evra told her.</p><p>She ran her fingers up his left arm - he was wearing a T-shirt - and down his right.</p><p>\"Wow!\" Debbie gasped. \"Have you always been like this?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Evra said.</p><p>\"He's a snake-boy,\" I explained.</p><p>Debbie whirled fiercely on me. \"That's a horrible thing to say!\" she snapped. \"You shouldn't call him names just because he looks different.\"</p><p>\"I wasn't calling him - \" I began, but she interrupted.</p><p>\"How would you like it if somebody made fun of that stupid costume you wear?\" she fumed. I looked down at my suit. \"Oh, yes!\" she sneered. \"I could have said plenty about that crazy getup, but I didn't. I figured, if you wanted to look like something out of Peter Pan, that was your choice.\"</p><p>\"It's okay,\" Evra said softly. \"I am a snake-boy.\" Debbie stared at Evra uncertainly. \"I am, really,\" he vowed. \"I have many serpentine qualities: I shed my skin, I'm cold-blooded, I have snakelike eyes.\"</p><p>\"Still,\" Debbie said, \"it's not nice to be compared to a snake.\"</p><p>\"It is if you like snakes.\" Evra laughed.</p><p>\"Oh.\" Debbie looked back at me, half ashamed. \"Sorry,\" she said.</p><p>\"It's okay,\" I said, secretly pleased that she'd reacted the way she had - it proved she wasn't prejudiced.</p><p>Debbie was fascinated by Evra and kept asking him questions. What did he eat? How often? \"Was he able to talk to snakes? After a while I told him to show her his tongue - he had a really long tongue and was able to stick it up his nose.</p><p>\"That's the grossest, greatest thing I've ever seen!\"</p><p>Debbie howled when Evra demonstrated his nostril-licking abilities. \"I wish I could do that. It'd freak the life out of everybody at school.\"</p><p>Eventually it was time to leave for the movies.</p><p>\"I won't be back late,\" I told Evra.</p><p>\"Don't rush on my account,\" he said, and winked.</p><p>It was a short walk to the cineplex, and we arrived in plenty of time for the start of the movie. We bought popcorn and drinks and headed in. We talked away to each other during the ads and previews.</p><p>\"I like your brother,\" Debbie said. \"He seems a little shy, but I guess that has to do with the way he looks.\"</p><p>\"Yeah,\" I agreed. \"Life hasn't been easy for him.\"</p><p>\"Is anybody else in your family snakelike?\" she asked.</p><p>\"No,\" I said. \"Evra's one of a kind.\"</p><p>\"Your mom isn't unusual?\" I'd told Debbie my mom and dad were divorced and that Evra and me spent half the year with each. \"Or your dad?\"</p><p>I smiled. \"Dad's strange, too,\" I said, \"but not like Evra.\"</p><p>\"When can I meet him?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Soon,\" I lied. Debbie had warmed immediately to the snake-boy, but how would she react to a vampire? I had a feeling she wouldn't warm up to Mr. Crepsley, not if she knew what he was.</p><p>The movie was a stupid romantic comedy. Debbie laughed more than me.</p><p>We discussed the movie afterward as we walked back to the square. I pretended to like it more than I did. As we walked down a dark alley, Debbie took my hand in hers and held on to me for comfort, which made me feel great.</p><p>\"Aren't you afraid of the dark?\" she asked.</p><p>\"No,\" I said. The alley seemed pretty bright to my vampire-enhanced eyes. \"What is there to be afraid of?\" I asked.</p><p>She shivered. \"I know it's silly,\" she said, \"but I'm always half afraid a vampire or werewolf's going to jump out and attack me.\" She laughed. \"Stupid, huh?\"</p><p>\"Yeah,\" I said, laughing weakly. \"Stupid.\"</p><p>If only she knew...</p><p>\"Your nails are really long,\" she commented.</p><p>\"Sorry,\" I said. My nails were incredibly tough. Scissors couldn't cut them. I had to chew on them with my teeth to keep them down.</p><p>\"No need to apologize,\" she said.</p><p>As we emerged from the alley, I felt her studying me by the light of the street lamps. \"What are you looking at?\" I asked.</p><p>\"There's something different about you, Darren,\" she mused. \"It's not something I can put my finger on.\"</p><p>I shrugged, trying to make light of it. \"It's because I'm so good-looking,\" I joked.</p><p>\"No,\" she said seriously. \"It's something inside you. I see it in your eyes sometimes.\"</p>","<p>I looked away. \"You're embarrassing me,\" I grumbled.</p><p>She gave my hand a squeeze. \"My dad always says that. He says I'm too inquisitive. My mind's always racing, and I'm always saying what's on it. I should learn to keep quiet.\"</p><p>We arrived at the square and I walked Debbie to her door. I stood awkwardly on the front step, wondering what to do next.</p><p>Debbie solved the problem for me.</p><p>\"Want to come in?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Aren't your parents home?\" I responded.</p><p>\"That's okay - they won't mind. I'll tell them you're a friend of a friend.\"</p><p>\"Well... okay,\" I said. \"If you're sure.\"</p><p>\"I am,\" she said, smiling, then took my hand and opened the door.</p><p>I was almost as nervous going in as I had been the night I crept down the cellar in the old theater in my hometown and stole Madam Octa from the sleeping Mr. Crepsley!</p><p>Chapter EIGHT</p><p>As it turned out, I had nothing to worry about. Debbie's parents were as nice as she was. Their names were Jesse and Donna - they wouldn't let me call them Mr. and Mrs. Hemlock - and they made me feel welcome as soon as I walked in.</p><p>\"Hello!\" Jesse said, seeing me first as we entered the living room. \"Who's this?\"</p><p>\"Mom, Dad, this is Darren,\" Debbie said. \"He's a friend of Anne's. I ran into him at the movies and invited him back. Is that okay?\"</p><p>\"Sure,\" Jesse said.</p><p>\"Of course,\" Donna agreed. \"We were about to have supper. Would you like some, Darren?\"</p><p>\"If it's no trouble,\" I said.</p><p>\"No trouble at all,\" she beamed. \"Do you like meatloaf?\"</p><p>\"It's my favorite,\" I told her. It wasn't really, but I guessed it would pay to be polite.</p><p>I told Jesse and Donna a little about myself as we ate.</p><p>\"What about school?\" Jesse asked, like Debbie had before him.</p><p>\"My dad used to be a teacher,\" I lied, having given some thought to the matter since yesterday. \"He teaches Evra and me.\"</p><p>\"More meatloaf, Darren?\" Donna asked.</p><p>\"Yes, please,\" I said. \"It's great.\" It was, too. Much better than any meatloaf I'd had before. \"What's in it?\"</p><p>\"A few extra spices,\" Donna said, smiling proudly. \"I used to be a chef.\"</p><p>\"I wish they had someone like you in the hotel.\" I sighed. \"Their food isn't very good.\"</p><p>I offered to wash the dishes when we were finished, but Jesse said he'd do them. \"It's my way of unwinding at the end of a hard day,\" he explained. \"Nothing I like better than scrubbing a few dirty dishes, polishing the banister and vacuuming the carpets.\"</p><p>\"Is he kidding?\" I asked Debbie.</p><p>\"Actually, no,\" she said. \"Okay if we go up to my room?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Go ahead,\" Donna told her. \"But don't chat for too long. We've got a couple of chapters of The Three Musketeers to finish, remember?\"</p><p>Debbie made a face. \"All for one and one for all,\" she groaned. \"How exciting - I don't think!\"</p><p>\"You don't likeThe Three Musketeers?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Do you?\"</p><p>\"Sure. I've seen the movie at least eight times.\"</p><p>\"But did you ever read the book?\" she asked.</p><p>\"No, but I read a comic book about them once.\"</p><p>Debbie shared a scornful glance with her mother, and the two burst out laughing.</p><p>\"I have to read a little of a so-called classic every night,\" Debbie grumbled. \"I hope you never learn just how boring those books can be.\"</p><p>\"Be down soon,\" she told her mother, then showed me the way upstairs.</p><p>Her room was on the third floor. A big, pretty-empty room, with large closets and hardly any posters or decorations.</p><p>\"I don't like feeling cluttered,\" Debbie explained when she saw me looking around.</p><p>There was a bare artificial Christmas tree in one corner of the room. There had been one in the living room, too, and I noticed a couple more in other rooms on my way up the stairs.</p><p>\"Why all the trees?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Dad's idea,\" Debbie said. \"He loves Christmas trees, so we get one for every room in the house. The ornaments are in little boxes underneath\" - she pointed to a box under the tree - \"and we open them on Christmas Eve and decorate the trees. It's a nice way to pass the night, and it tires you out, so you fall asleep almost as soon as your head hits the pillows.\"</p><p>\"It sounds like fun,\" I agreed wistfully, remembering what it had been like to decorate the Christmas tree at home with my family.</p><p>Debbie studied me silently. \"You could come over on Christmas Eve,\" she said. \"You and Evra. Your dad, too. You could help us with the trees.\"</p><p>I stared at her. \"You mean that?\"</p><p>\"Sure. I'd have to check with Mom and Dad first, but I doubt if they'd mind. We've had friends over to help before. It's nicer with more people.\"</p><p>I was happy that she'd asked me, but I hesitated before accepting.</p><p>\"Should I ask them?\" she said.</p><p>\"I'm not sure if I'll still be here at Christmas. Mr. Cre - Dad is unpredictable. He goes wherever the job takes him, whenever.\"</p><p>\"Well, the offer's there,\" she said. \"If you're here, great. If not,\" - she shrugged - \"we'll manage by ourselves.\"</p><p>We got talking about Christmas presents. \"Are you going to get the CD player for Evra?\" Debbie asked.</p><p>\"Yeah. And a few CDs, too.\"</p><p>\"That just leaves your dad,\" she said. \"What are you getting him?\"</p><p>I thought about Mr. Crepsley and what he might like. I wasn't going to buy him anything - he'd only turn up his nose at presents - but it was interesting to consider what I could buy him. What was there that a vampire could possibly be interested in?</p><p>I started to smile. \"I know,\" I said. \"I'll get him a sun lamp.\"</p><p>\"A sun lamp?\" Debbie frowned.</p><p>\"So he can work up a tan.\" I began to laugh. \"He's pretty pale. He doesn't get much sun.\"</p><p>Debbie couldn't understand why I was laughing so hard. I would have liked to let her in on the joke - it would be worth buying the sun lamp just to see the disgusted expression on the vampire's face - but didn't dare.</p><p>\"You have a weird sense of humor,\" she muttered, bewildered.</p><p>\"Trust me,\" I said, \"if you knew my dad, you'd know why I was laughing.\" I was going to tell Evra about my idea when I got home: he'd be able to appreciate it.</p><p>We chatted for another hour or so. Then it was time for me to go.</p><p>\"Well?\" Debbie said, as I stood up. \"Don't I get a good-night kiss?\"</p><p>I thought I was going to collapse.</p><p>\"I... um... I mean... that is...\" I became a stuttering wreck.</p><p>\"Don't you want to kiss me?\" Debbie asked.</p><p>\"Yes!\" I gasped quickly. \"It's just... I... um...\"</p><p>\"Hey, forget it,\" Debbie said, shrugging. \"I don't care one way or the other.\" She got up. \"I'll show you out.\"</p><p>We walked quickly down the stairs. I wanted to say goodbye to Jesse and Donna, but Debbie didn't give me the chance. She went straight to the front door and opened it. I was still trying to get back into my coat.</p><p>\"Can I come over tomorrow?\" I asked, struggling to find the left arm of the coat.</p><p>\"Sure, if you want to,\" she said.</p><p>\"Look, Debbie,\" I said, \"I'm sorry I didn't kiss you. I'm just -?</p><p>\"Scared?\" she asked, smiling.</p><p>\"Yeah,\" I admitted.</p><p>She laughed. \"Okay,\" she said. \"You can come over tomorrow. I want you to. Only, next time be a little braver, okay?\" And she closed the door behind me.</p><p>Chapter NINE</p><p>I lingered on the step for a long time, feeling stupid. I started back for the hotel but was reluctant to return - I didn't want to admit to Evra how dumb I'd been. So I walked around the square a couple of times, letting the cold night air fill my lungs and clear my head.</p><p>I was supposed to meet Debbie the next day, but suddenly I felt like I couldn't wait that long. My mind made up, I stopped in front of her house and looked around to make sure I wasn't being watched. I couldn't see anybody, and with my superior eyesight I was sure no one could see me.</p><p>I slipped off my shoes and climbed the drainpipe that ran down the front of the house. The window to Debbie's room was three or four feet from the pipe, so when I came level with it, I dug my tough nails into the brick of the building and clawed my way across.</p><p>I hung just beneath the window and waited for Debbie to appear.</p><p>About twenty minutes later, the light in Debbie's room clicked on. I knocked softly on the glass with my bare knuckles, then knocked again a little harder. Footsteps approached.</p><p>Debbie opened the curtains a little and stared out, confused. It took her a few seconds to look down and notice me. When she did, she almost collapsed with surprise.</p><p>\"Open the window,\" I said, mouthing the words clearly in case she couldn't hear me. Nodding, she dropped to her knees and shoved up the lower pane of glass.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" she hissed. \"What are you holding on to?\"</p><p>\"I'm floating on air,\" I joked.</p><p>\"You're crazy,\" Debbie said. \"You'll slip and fall.\"</p><p>\"I'm totally safe,\" I assured her. \"I'm a good climber.\"</p><p>\"You must be freezing,\" she said, spotting my feet. \"Where are your shoes? Come in, quick, before you -?</p><p>\"I don't want to come in,\" I interrupted. \"I climbed up because... well... I...\" I took a deep breath. \"Is the offer still on?\"</p><p>\"What offer?\" Debbie asked.</p><p>\"The offer of a kiss,\" I said.</p><p>Debbie blinked, then smiled. \"You are crazy.\" She laughed.</p><p>\"One hundred percent crazy,\" I agreed.</p><p>\"You went to all this trouble just for that?\" she asked.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\"You could have knocked on the door,\" she said.</p><p>\"I didn't think of that.\" I smiled. \"So - how about it?\"</p><p>\"I suppose you deserve one,\" she said, \"but quickly, okay?\"</p><p>\"All right,\" I agreed.</p><p>Debbie stuck her head out. I leaned forward, heart beating, and pecked her lips.</p><p>She smiled. \"Worth coming up for?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said. I was shaking, and it wasn't from the cold.</p><p>\"Here,\" she said. \"Here's another one.\"</p><p>She kissed me sweetly, and I almost lost my grip on the wall.</p><p>When she moved away, she was smiling mysteriously. In the reflection of the dark glass, I saw myself grinning like an idiot.</p><p>\"See you tomorrow, Romeo,\" she said.</p><p>\"Tomorrow,\" I sighed happily.</p><p>As the window shut and the curtains closed, I climbed down, delighted with myself. I practically bounced back to the hotel. I was almost at the door before I remembered my shoes. Hurrying back, I retrieved them, shook the snow off, and shoved them on.</p><p>By the time I got to the hotel, I had regained my composure. I opened the door of my room and entered. Evra was watching TV. He was focused on the screen and barely noticed me coming in.</p><p>\"I'm back,\" I said, taking off my coat. He didn't reply. \"I'm back!\" I repeated, louder.</p><p>\"Um,\" he grunted, waving distractedly at me.</p><p>\"That's a great attitude,\" I said. \"I thought you'd be interested in how the night went. I'll know better next time. In the future, I'll just -?</p><p>\"Have you seen the news?\" Evra asked quietly.</p><p>\"It may surprise you to learn, young Evra Von,\" I said sarcastically, \"that they don't show newsreels at the movies anymore. Now do you want to hear about my date or not?\"</p><p>\"You should watch this,\" Evra said.</p><p>\"Watch what?\" I asked, irritated. I walked around behind him and saw it was a news program. \"The news?\" I laughed. \"Turn it off, Evra, and I'll tell you about -?</p><p>\"Darren!\" Evra snapped in a very unusual tone. He looked up at me, and his face was a mask of worry. \"You should watch this,\" he said again, slowly this time, and I realized he wasn't kidding.</p><p>Sitting down, I studied the TV screen. There was a picture of the outside of a building on it, then the camera dissolved to an interior shot and scanned around the walls. A caption told viewers that the photographs Were from stock footage, which meant they'd been filmed sometime in the past. A reporter was babbling on about the building.</p><p>\"What's the big deal?\" I asked.</p><p>\"This is where they found the bodies,\" Evra said softly.</p><p>\"What bodies?\"</p><p>\"Watch,\" he said.</p><p>The camera came to rest in a dark room that looked the same as all the others, held on the scene for a few seconds, then dissolved back to a view of the building's exterior. The caption told us that these new picture had been shot earlier that day. As I watched, several policemen and doctors came out of the building, pushing stretchers, each of which held a motionless object covered by a body bag.</p><p>\"Are those what I think they are?\" I asked quietly.</p><p>\"Corpses,\" Evra confirmed. \"Six so far. The police are still searching the building.\"</p><p>\"What does it have to do with us?\" I asked uneasily.</p><p>\"Listen.\" He turned up the sound.</p><p>A reporter was talking into the camera now, live, explaining how the police found the bodies - a couple of teenagers had stumbled over them while they were exploring the deserted building as a dare - and when, and how the search was progressing. The reporter looked pretty stunned.</p>","<p>An anchorman in the studio asked the reporter a question about the bodies, to which she shook her head.</p><p>\"No,\" she said, \"the police aren't giving out names, and won't until the relatives of the deceased have been notified.\"</p><p>\"Have you learned any more about the nature of their deaths?\" the anchorman asked.</p><p>\"No,\" the reporter replied. \"The police have blocked the flow of information. We only have the early reports to go on. The six people - we don't know if they're men or women - appear to be victims of a serial killer or some sort of sacrificial cult. We don't know about the last two bodies brought up, but the first four all shared the same bizarre wounds and conditions.\"</p><p>\"Could you explain once again what those conditions were?\" the anchorman asked.</p><p>The reported nodded. \"The victims - at least the first four - have slit throats, which seem to be the means by which they were killed. In addition, the bodies appear - and I must stress that this is an early, unverified report - to have been drained of all their blood.\"</p><p>\"Possibly sucked out or pumped dry?\" the anchorman suggested.</p><p>The reporter shrugged. \"As of the moment, nobody can answer that, except the police.\" She paused. \"And, of course, the murderer.\"</p><p>Evra switched the sound off but left the picture on.</p><p>\"See?\" he said softly.</p><p>\"Oh, no,\" I gasped. I thought of Mr. Crepsley, who'd been out alone every night since we arrived, prowling the city for reasons he wouldn't reveal. I thought of the six bodies and the reporter's and anchorman's comments: \"... drained of all their blood.\"</p><p>\"Possibly sucked out or pumped dry.\"</p><p>\"Mr. Crepsley,\" I said. And for a long time I gazed in silence at the screen, not able to say anything more.</p><p>Chapter TEN</p><p>I paced furiously around the hotel room, hands clenched into fists, swearing angrily, Evra watching mutely.</p><p>\"I'm going to kill him,\" I finally muttered. \"I'll wait for day, pull back the curtains, drive a stake through his heart, chop his head off, and set him on fire.\"</p><p>\"You don't believe in taking chances, do you?\" Evra tried to joke. \"I suppose you'll scoop his brains out, too, and stuff the space inside his head with garlic.\"</p><p>\"How can you make jokes at a time like this?\" I howled.</p><p>Evra hesitated. \"It might not have been him.\"</p><p>\"Come off it!\" I barked. \"Who else could it have been?\"</p><p>\"I don't know.\"</p><p>\"The blood was sucked out of them!\" I shouted.</p><p>\"That's what the reporters think,\" Evra said. \"They weren't certain.\"</p><p>\"Maybe we should wait,\" I huffed. \"Wait for him to kill another five or six, huh?\"</p><p>Evra sighed. \"I don't know what we should do,\" he said. \"But I think we should have proof before we go after him. Chopping a person's head off is kind of final. If we find out later we were mistaken, there's no going back. We can't glue his head back on and say, 'Sorry, all a big mistake, no hard feelings.?</p><p>He was right. Killing Mr. Crepsley without proof would be wrong. But it had to be him! Those nights out, acting so strangely, not telling us what he was doing - it all added up.</p><p>\"There's something else,\" Evra said. I glanced down at him. \"Let's say Mr. Crepsley is the killer.\"</p><p>\"I have no problem accepting that.\" I grunted.</p><p>\"Why would he do it?\" Evra asked. \"It's not his style. I've known him longer than you have, and I've never seen or heard of him doing anything like this. He's not a killer.\"</p><p>\"He probably killed when he was a Vampire General,\" I said. I had told Evra about my conversation with Gavner Purl.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Evra agreed. \"He killed evil vampires, who deserved to be killed. What I'm saying is, if he did kill these six people, maybe they had to be killed, too. Maybe they were vampires.\"</p><p>I shook my head. \"He gave up being a Vampire General years ago.\"</p><p>\"Gavner Purl could have persuaded him to join again,\" Evra said. \"We don't know anything about the Vampire Generals or how they work. Maybe that's why Mr. Crepsley came here.\"</p><p>It sounded halfway reasonable, but I didn't believe it.</p><p>\"Six evil vampires on the loose in one city?\" I asked. \"What are the odds against that?\"</p><p>\"Who knows?\" Evra said. \"Do you know how an evil vampire behaves? I don't, maybe they form gangs.\"</p><p>\"And Mr. Crepsley wiped them out by himself?\" I said. \"Vampires are tough to kill. He'd have no problem killing six humans, but six vampires? No way.\"</p><p>\"Who says he was alone?\" Evra asked. \"Maybe Gavner Purl was with him. Maybe there's a bunch of Vampire Generals in town.\"</p><p>\"Your argument's getting weaker by the second,\" I commented.</p><p>\"Possibly,\" Evra said, \"but that doesn't mean I'm wrong. We don't know, Darren. You can't kill Mr. Crepsley on a hunch. We have to wait. Think about it and you'll see I'm right.\"</p><p>I calmed down and thought it over. \"Okay,\" I sighed. \"He's innocent until proven guilty. But what should we do? Sit back and pretend nothing's happened? Report him to the police? Ask him straight to his face?\"</p><p>\"If we were at the Cirque Du Freak,\" Evra mused, \"we could tell Mr. Tall and leave it in his hands.\"</p><p>\"But we're not at the Cirque,\" I reminded him.</p><p>\"No,\" he said. \"We're on our own.\" His narrow eyes narrowed even further as he mulled it over. \"How about this? We track him every night when he leaves, see where he goes and what he gets up to. If we find out he's the killer, and that these are ordinary humans, then we kill him.\"</p><p>\"You'd do that?\" I asked.</p><p>Evra nodded. \"I've never killed before,\" he said quietly, \"and I hate the thought of it. But if Mr. Crepsley is murdering without good cause, I'll help you kill him. I'd rather leave it to someone else, but since there isn't anybody...\"</p><p>His face was serious, and I knew I could rely on him.</p><p>\"But we have to be sure,\" Evra warned me. \"If there's even a glimmer of doubt, we can't do it.\"</p><p>\"Agreed,\" I said.</p><p>\"And it has to be a joint decision,\" Evra added.</p><p>\"You have to promise you won't kill him without my approval.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\"</p><p>\"I'm serious,\" he told me. \"If I think Mr. Crepsley is innocent, and you go after him, I'll do everything I can to stop you. Even if it means...\" He left the threat unfinished.</p><p>\"Don't worry,\" I said. \"This isn't something I'm looking forward to. I've grown used to Mr. Crepsley. The last thing I want to do is kill him.\"</p><p>I was telling the truth. I'd love it if my suspicions turned out to be wrong. But I had an awful feeling they wouldn't.</p><p>\"I hope we're mistaken about this,\" Evra said. \"Saying we'll kill him is easy, but doing it would be a lot harder. He's not the kind to just lie there and do nothing while being attacked.\"</p><p>\"We'll worry about that later,\" I said. \"For the moment, let's turn the sound back up. If we're lucky, the police will solve the case and it'll be nothing more than a crazy human who's seen one too many Dracula movies.\"</p><p>I sat down beside Evra, and we spent the rest of night watching the news, rarely speaking, waiting for the vampire - the killer? - to return.</p><p>Chapter ELEVEN</p><p>Shadowing Mr. Crepsley wasn't easy. The first night we lost him after a couple of minutes: he shot up a fire escape and by the time we got to the top he was nowhere to be seen. We wandered around the city for a few hours, hoping to stumble upon him, but saw neither hide nor hair of him for the rest of the night.</p><p>We learned from that experience. While Mr. Crepsley slept the next day, I went and bought a couple of cell phones. Evra and me tested them out before dusk, and they worked pretty well.</p><p>That night, when Mr. Crepsley headed for the rooftops, Evra stuck to the ground. He couldn't move as fast as me. By myself, I was able to keep track of the vampire and pass the information to Evra, who followed on the ground.</p><p>Even alone, it was difficult to keep up. Mr. Crepsley could move a lot quicker than me. Fortunately, he had no idea I was after him, so he didn't go as fast as he could, since he didn't think he had any need to.</p><p>I kept him in sight for three hours that night before losing him when he slipped down to street level and took a couple of turns that I missed. The next night I stuck with him until dawn. It varied after that: some nights I'd lose him within an hour; others I'd be on his tail until morning.</p><p>He didn't do much while I was following him. Sometimes he'd stop in one place for a long time above crowds of people and observe them silently (picking out his next victim?). Other times he roamed without stopping. His routes were unpredictable: he might go the same way two or three nights in a row, or try entirely new directions every night. It was impossible to anticipate his moves.</p><p>Evra was exhausted at the end of each night - I kept forgetting he wasn't as powerful as me - but he never complained. I said he could stay in for a few nights if he wanted, but he shook his head and insisted on coming with me.</p><p>Maybe he thought I'd kill Mr. Crepsley if he wasn't around.</p><p>Maybe he was right.</p><p>No fresh bodies had been discovered since news of the six in the building broke. It had been confirmed that all the bodies had been drained of their blood, and that they were ordinary humans: two men and four women. All were young - the oldest was twenty-seven - and from different parts of the city.</p><p>Evra's disappointment was evident when he heard the victims were normal people - it would have made life much easier if they'd been vampires.</p><p>\"Would doctors be able to tell the difference between a human and a vampire?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Of course,\" I replied.</p><p>\"How?\"</p><p>\"Different kind of blood,\" I said.</p><p>\"But they were drained of blood,\" he reminded me.</p><p>\"Their cells wouldn't be the same. Atoms act strangely in vampires - that's why they can't be photographed. And they'd have extra-tough nails and teeth. The doctors would know, Evra.\"</p><p>I was trying to keep an open mind. Mr. Crepsley hadn't killed anyone while we'd been following him, which was a good sign. On the other hand, maybe he was waiting for the fuss to die down before striking again - at the moment, if somebody was late home from school or work, alarm bells rang immediately.</p><p>Or perhaps he had killed. Maybe he knew we were following him and was only killing when he was cer-tain he'd lost us. That was unlikely, but I didn't rule it out completely. Mr. Crepsley could be crafty when he wanted. I wouldn't have put anything past him.</p><p>Although I was sleeping through most of the days - in order to stay awake at night - I made a point of waking a couple of hours before sunset to spend some time with Debbie. Usually I went over to her house and we sat upstairs in her bedroom and played music and talked - I was always trying to conserve energy for the night chase ahead - but sometimes we'd go for a walk or hit the stores.</p><p>I was determined not to let Mr. Crepsley ruin my friendship with Debbie. I loved being with her. She was my first girlfriend. I knew we'd have to break up sooner rather than later - I hadn't forgotten what I was - but I wouldn't do anything to shorten our time together. I'd given up my nights to pursue Mr. Crepsley. I wasn't going to give up my days, too.</p><p>\"How come you don't come around after dark anymore?\" she asked one Saturday as we came out of a matinee. I'd woken up earlier than usual so that I could spend the day with her.</p><p>\"I'm afraid of the dark,\" I whimpered.</p><p>\"Seriously,\" she said, pinching my arm.</p><p>\"My dad doesn't like me going out at night,\" I lied. \"He feels a little guilty, not being around during the day. He likes Evra and me to sit with him at night and tell him what we've been up to.\"</p><p>\"I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you went out now and then,\" Debbie protested. \"He let you out the night of our first date, didn't he?\"</p><p>I shook my head. \"I snuck out,\" I said. \"He went crazy when he found out. Wouldn't speak to me for a week. That's why I haven't introduced you to him - he's still fuming.\"</p><p>\"He sounds like a mean old man,\" Debbie said.</p><p>\"He is.\" I sighed. \"But what can I do? He's my dad. I have to stick by him.\"</p><p>I felt bad lying to her, but I could hardly tell her the truth. I smiled to myself when I imagined breaking the news: \"That guy I say is my father? He's not. He's a vampire. Oh, and I think he's the one who killed those six people.\"</p><p>\"What are you smiling at?\" Debbie asked.</p><p>\"Nothing,\" I said quickly, wiping the smile from my face.</p><p>It was a strange double life - normal boy by day, deadly vampire-tracker by night - but I was enjoying it. If it had been a year or so earlier, I would have been confused; I would have tossed and turned in my sleep, worrying about what the next night would bring; my eating habits might have been affected and I would have become depressed; I probably would have chosen to focus on one thing at a time, and stopped meeting Debbie.</p><p>Not now. My experiences with Mr. Crepsley and the Cirque Du Freak had changed me. I was able to handle two different roles. In fact, I liked the variation: tracking the vampire at night made me feel big and important - Darren Shan, protector of the sleeping city! - and seeing Debbie in the afternoons let me feel like a normal human boy. I had the best of both worlds.</p>","<p>That stopped when Mr. Crepsley zoomed in on the next victim - the fat man.</p><p>Chapter TWELVE</p><p>I didn't realize at first that Mr. Crepsley was following someone. He was hovering above a busy shopping street, where he'd been for almost an hour, studying the shoppers. Then, without warning, he climbed to the top of the building he'd been clinging to and started across the roof.</p><p>I called Evra. He never called me, for fear the vampire would hear my phone. \"He's on the move again,\" I said quietly.</p><p>\"About time,\" Evra grumbled. \"I hate it when he stops. You don't know how cold it gets, standing still down here.\"</p><p>\"Go get something to eat,\" I told him. \"He's moving pretty slowly. I think you can take five or ten minutes off.\"</p><p>\"Are you sure?\" Evra asked.</p><p>\"Yeah,\" I said. \"I'll call you if anything happens.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" Evra said. \"I'd love a hot dog and a cup of hot chocolate. You want me to pick something up for you?\"</p><p>\"No thanks,\" I said. \"I'll keep in touch. See you soon.\" I hit the off switch and started after the vampire.</p><p>I didn't like eating stuff like hot dogs, burgers, or French fries while tracking Mr. Crepsley: his nose could easily detect such strong scents. I ate dry slices of bread - which produced almost no smell - to keep my hunger down. I had ordinary tap water in a bottle to drink.</p><p>After a couple of minutes I got curious. The other nights, he'd either stayed in one spot or wandered around without direction. He was moving with purpose this time.</p><p>I decided to get closer. It was dangerous, especially since he wasn't rushing - he was more likely to spot me - but I had to see what he was up to.</p><p>Closing the gap by a third - as near to him as I dared get - I saw that he was sticking his head out over the edge of the roof, keeping a watch on the street below.</p><p>Looking down at the well-lit street, I couldn't spot who he was after. It was only when he paused above a lamp that I noticed the fat man at the base, adjusting his shoelaces.</p><p>That was it! Mr. Crepsley was after the fat man! I knew by the way the vampire stared, waiting for him to tie his shoelaces and move on. When the fat man finally stood up and started walking again, sure enough, Mr. Crepsley followed.</p><p>Taking a few steps back, I called Evra.</p><p>\"What's up?\" he asked. I could hear him munching on his hot dog. There were voices in the background.</p><p>\"Action,\" I said simply.</p><p>\"Oh, hell!\" Evra gasped. I heard him dropping the hot dog and shuffling away from the people behind him, to a quieter spot. \"Are you sure?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Positive,\" I said. \"The prey has been sighted.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" Evra sighed. He sounded nervous. I didn't blame him - I was nervous, too. \"Okay,\" he said again. \"Give me your position.\"</p><p>I read out the name of the street. \"But don't rush,\" I told him. \"They're moving slowly. Stay a couple of streets back. I don't want Mr. Crepsley spotting you.\"</p><p>\" Idon't want him spotting me either!\" Evra snorted. \"Keep me up to date.\"</p><p>\"Will do,\" I promised. Clicking off the phone, I started after the pursuing vampire.</p><p>He trailed the fat man to a large building, which the human disappeared into. Mr. Crepsley waited half an hour, then slowly circled the building, checking on windows and doors. I trudged along behind, keeping my distance, ready to race after him if he entered.</p><p>He didn't. Instead, when he was through examining the place, he went to a nearby rooftop, from where he had a perfect view of all the entrances, and sat down to wait.</p><p>I told Evra what was happening.</p><p>\"He's just sitting there?\" Evra asked.</p><p>\"Sitting and watching,\" I confirmed.</p><p>\"What sort of place is it?\"</p><p>I'd read the name on the walls while I was passing them, and seen in a couple of the windows, but I could have told Evra what went on in the building just by the foul smell of animal blood in the air.</p><p>\"It's a slaughterhouse,\" I whispered.</p><p>There was a long pause. Then: \"Maybe he's just here for the animal blood,\" Evra suggested.</p><p>\"No. He would have entered by now if that was the case. He didn't come for the animals. He came for the human.\"</p><p>\"We don't know that,\" Evra said. \"Maybe he's waiting for it to close before going in.\"</p><p>\"He'd have a long wait,\" I laughed. \"It stays open all night.\"</p><p>\"I'm coming up,\" Evra said. \"Don't move until I get there.\"</p><p>\"I'll move when Mr. Crepsley moves, whether you're here or not,\" I said, but Evra had hung up and didn't hear me.</p><p>He arrived a few minutes later, his breath stinking of mustard and onions. \"Dry bread for you from now on,\" I muttered.</p><p>\"Do you think Mr. Crepsley will smell me?\" Evra asked. \"Maybe I should go back down and -?</p><p>I shook my head. \"He's too close to the slaughterhouse,\" I said. \"The smell of blood will block everything else out.\"</p><p>\"Where is he?\" Evra asked. I pointed the vampire out. Evra had to squint but eventually spotted him.</p><p>\"We have to be extra quiet,\" I said. \"Even a small noise could have him swooping down on us.\"</p><p>Evra shivered - whether because of the cold or the thought of being attacked, I don't know - and settled down. We said hardly anything to each other after that.</p><p>We had to breathe into our cupped fists to stop our breath from showing. We would have been all right if it had been snowing - the snow would have hidden the smokelike tendrils - but it was a clear and frosty night.</p><p>We sat there until three in the morning. Evra's teeth were chattering, and I was at the point of sending him home before he froze to death, when the fat man emerged. Mr. Crepsley started after him immediately.</p><p>Too late, I realized the vampire was going to pass by us on his way back. There was no time to hide. He'd see us!</p><p>\"Keep perfectly still,\" I whispered to Evra. \"Don't even breathe.\"</p><p>The vampire came toward us, walking steadily across the icy roofs in his bare feet. I was certain he'd spot us, but his eyes were trained on the human. He passed within ten feet of us - his shadow crept over me like some awful ghost - and then he was gone.</p><p>\"I think my heart stopped,\" Evra said shakily.</p><p>I heard the familiar thump-thump sounds of the snake-boy's heart (it beat slightly slower than a normal human's) and smiled. \"You're okay,\" I told him.</p><p>\"I thought we were done for,\" Evra hissed.</p><p>\"Me, too.\" I stood and checked which way the vampire was going. \"You'd better slip back down to the street,\" I told Evra.</p><p>\"He's not going fast,\" Evra said. \"I can keep up.\"</p><p>I shook my head. \"There's no telling when he'll speed up: the man might get in a cab or have a car waiting for him. Besides, after our narrow escape, it's better we split: that way, if one of us gets caught, the other can sneak back to the hotel and pretend he wasn't involved.\"</p><p>Evra saw the sense in that and went down the nearest fire escape. I began following the tracks of the vampire and the fat man.</p><p>He walked back the way he'd come, past the deserted street where we first picked him up, on to a block of apartments.</p><p>He lived in one of the central apartments on the sixth floor. Mr. Crepsley waited for the lights to go off inside, then went up in the elevator. I ran up the stairs and watched from the far end of the landing.</p><p>I expected him to open the door and enter - locks were no problem for the vampire - but all he did was check the door and windows. Then he turned around and went back to the elevator.</p><p>I hurried down the stairs and got the vampire back in view as he walked away from the apartments. I told Evra what had happened and where the vampire was heading. A few minutes later he caught up with me and we followed Mr. Crepsley as he jogged through the streets.</p><p>\"Why didn't he go in?\" Evra asked.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" I said. \"Maybe there was somebody else there. Or maybe he plans to come back later.</p><p>One thing's for sure: he didn't go up there to send a letter!\"</p><p>After a while, we turned a corner into an alley and spotted Mr. Crepsley bent over a motionless woman. Evra gasped and started forward. I caught his arm and yanked him back.</p><p>\" What are you doing?\" he hissed. \"Didn't you see? He's attacking! We have to stop him before -?</p><p>\"It's okay,\" I said. \"He isn't attacking. He's feeding.\"</p><p>Evra's struggles stopped. \"You're sure?\" he asked suspiciously.</p><p>I nodded. \"He's drinking from the woman's arm. The corpses in the building had their throats cut, remember?\"</p><p>Evra nodded uncertainly. \"If you're wrong...\"</p><p>\"I'm not,\" I assured him.</p><p>Minutes later, the vampire moved on, leaving the woman behind. We hurried down the alley to check. As I'd guessed, she was unconscious but alive, a small, fresh scar on her left arm the only sign that she had been feasted upon.</p><p>\"Let's go,\" I said, standing. \"She'll wake up in a few minutes. We'd better not be here when she does.\"</p><p>\"What about Mr. Crepsley?\" Evra asked.</p><p>I looked up at the sky, estimating how long was left until dawn. \"He won't kill anyone tonight,\" I said. \"It's too late. He's probably heading back for the hotel. Come on - if we don't get back before him, we'll have a hell of a time trying to explain where we were.\"</p><p>Chapter THIRTEEN</p><p>Before dusk descended the next night, Evra went around to the block of apartments to keep watch on the fat man. I stayed home, in order to follow Mr. Crepsley. If the vampire headed for the apartments, I'd join Evra. If he went anywhere else, we'd discuss the situation and decide whether Evra should desert his post or stay.</p><p>The vampire rose promptly as the sun went down. He was looking more cheerful tonight, though he still wouldn't have appeared out of place in a funeral parlor.</p><p>\"Where is Evra?\" he asked, diving into the meal I had prepared.</p><p>\"Shopping,\" I said.</p><p>\"By himself?\" Mr. Crepsley paused. For a moment</p><p>I thought he was suspicious, but he was just looking for the salt.</p><p>\"I think he's buying Christmas presents,\" I said.</p><p>\"I thought Evra was above such absurdities. What is the date, anyway?\"</p><p>\"The twentieth of December,\" I answered.</p><p>\"And Christmas is the twenty-fifth?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley rubbed his scar thoughtfully. \"My business here may have come to an end by then,\" he said.</p><p>\"Oh?\" I tried not to sound curious or excited.</p><p>\"I had planned to move on as soon as possible, but if you wish to remain here for Christmas, we can. I understand the staff are hosting some kind of celebration?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said.</p><p>\"You would like to attend?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" I forced a smile. \"Evra and me are buying presents for each other. We're going to eat dinner with the rest of the guests and eat cookies and stuff ourselves with turkey. You can come, too, if you want.\" I tried to make it sound like I wanted him there.</p><p>He smiled and shook his head. \"Such follies do not appeal to me,\" he said.</p><p>\"Suit yourself,\" I replied.</p><p>As soon as he left, I started after him. He led me straight to the slaughterhouse, which surprised me. Maybe it wasn't the fat man he was interested in: perhaps there was something - or somebody - else there that he had his eye on.</p><p>I discussed it with Evra over the phone.</p><p>\"It's weird,\" he agreed. \"Maybe he wants to catch him when he's entering or leaving work.\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\" I said uncertainly. Something seemed odd about it. The vampire wasn't behaving as I had expected him to.</p><p>Evra stayed where he was, to follow the fat man. I chose a safe spot to hide, next to a warm pipe that kept some of the cold out. My view of the slaughterhouse wasn't as good as it had been last night, but I had a clear sight of Mr. Crepsley, which was what mattered.</p><p>The fat man arrived at the scheduled time, Evra soon after him. I moved to the edge of the roof when I saw them, ready to leap down and intervene if Mr. Crepsley made his move. But the vampire remained stationary.</p><p>And that was it for the night. Mr. Crepsley sat on his ledge; Evra and me crouched on ours; the workers kept the slaughterhouse up and running. At three in the morning, the fat man reappeared and went home.</p><p>Once again Mr. Crepsley followed, and once again we followed Mr. Crepsley. This time the vampire didn't go up to the landing, but that was the only change in the routine.</p><p>The next night, the exact same thing happened.</p><p>\"What's he up to?\" Evra asked. The cold was getting to him and he was complaining about cramps in his legs. I had told him he could leave, but he was determined to stick it out.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" I said. \"Maybe he's waiting for a special time to act. Maybe the moon has to be in a certain position or something.\"</p><p>\"I thought werewolves were the only monsters affected by the moon,\" Evra said, half-jokingly.</p><p>\"I thought so, too,\" I said. \"But I'm not sure. There's so much Mr. Crepsley hasn't told me about being a full vampire. You could fill a book with all the stuff I know nothing about.\"</p><p>\"What are we going to do if he attacks?\" Evra asked. \"Do you think we stand a chance against him in a fight?\"</p><p>\"Not a fair fight,\" I said. \"But in a dirty one...\" I pulled out a long, rusty butcher's knife, let Evra's eyes focus on it, then slipped it back beneath my shirt.</p>","<p>\"Where did you get that?\" Evra gasped.</p><p>\"I came exploring around the slaughterhouse to-day, to familiarize myself with the layout, and found this knife lying in a bin out back. I guess it was too rusty to be of any use.\"</p><p>\"That's what you're going to use?\" Evra asked quietly.</p><p>I nodded. \"I'll slit his throat,\" I whispered. \"I'll wait for him to make his move, then...\" I clenched my jaw shut.</p><p>\"You think you can do it? He's really fast. If you miss your first chance, you probably won't get a second.\"</p><p>\"He won't be expecting me,\" I said. \"I can do it.\" I faced Evra. \"I know we agreed to do this together, but I want to go after him by myself when the time comes.\"</p><p>\"No way!\" Evra hissed.</p><p>\"I have to,\" I said. \"You can't move as quietly or as quickly as me. If you come, you'll be in the way. Besides,\" I added, \"if things go badly and I fail, you'll still be around to take another shot at him. Wait for day and get him while he's sleeping.\"</p><p>\"Maybe that's the best solution,\" Evra said. \"Maybe we should both wait. The main reason we're here is to confirm he's the killer. If he is, and we get proof, why don't we wait and -?</p><p>\"No,\" I said softly. \"I won't let him murder that man.\"</p><p>\"You know nothing about him,\" Evra said. \"Remember what I said: that the six dead people may have been killed because they were evil? Maybe this guy's rotten.\"</p><p>\"I don't care,\" I said stubbornly. \"I only agreed to go along with Mr. Crepsley because he convinced me he wasn't bad, that he didn't kill people. If he is a killer, I'm guilty, too, for believing him and helping him all this time. I could do nothing to stop the first six murders - but if I can prevent number seven, I will.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" Evra sighed. \"Have it your own way.\"</p><p>\"You won't interfere?\"</p><p>\"No,\" he promised.</p><p>\"Even if I run into trouble and look like I need help?\"</p><p>He hesitated before nodding. \"All right. Not even then.\"</p><p>\"You're a good friend, Evra,\" I said, clasping his hands.</p><p>\"Think so?\" He smiled bitterly. \"Wait until you mess up with Mr. Crepsley and end up trapped, screaming for help, only for me to ignore you. We'll see what kind of a friend you think I am then!\"</p><p>Chapter FOURTEEN</p><p>On the night of the twenty-second of December, Mr. Crepsley made his move.</p><p>Evra spotted him. I was taking a short break, resting my eyes - even a half-vampire's eyes get sore after hours of concentration - when Evra made a sudden alarmed jump and grabbed my ankle.</p><p>\"He's moving!\"</p><p>I sprang forward, just in time to see the vampire leaping onto the roof of the slaughterhouse. He wrestled open a window and quickly slipped inside.</p><p>\"This is it!\" I moaned, leaping to my feet and taking off.</p><p>\"Wait a sec,\" Evra said. \"I'm coming with you.\"</p><p>\"No!\" I snapped. \"We discussed this. You promised -?</p><p>\"I won't come all the way in,\" Evra said. \"But I'm not going to sit over here worrying myself crazy. I'll wait for you inside the slaughterhouse.\"</p><p>There was no time to argue. Nodding quickly, I ran. Evra hurried after me as fast as he could.</p><p>I paused at the open window and listened carefully for sounds of the vampire. There were none. Evra pulled up beside me, gasping from the exertion of the run. I climbed in and Evra followed.</p><p>We found ourselves in a long room filled with pipes. The floor was covered in dust, in which Mr. Crepsley's footprints were clearly visible. We traced the prints to a door, which opened onto a tiled corridor. The dust that Mr. Crepsley's feet had picked up crossing the room now marked his path across the tiles.</p><p>We followed the dusty trail along the corridor and down a flight of stairs. We were in a quiet part of the slaughterhouse - the workers were grouped near the other end - but we moved cautiously anyway: it wouldn't be good to be caught at this delicate stage of the game.</p><p>As the dust grew fainter by the step, I worried about losing the vampire. I didn't want to have to search blindly around the slaughterhouse for him, so I quickened my pace. Evra did, too.</p><p>As we turned a corner, I saw a familiar red cape and promptly stopped. I stepped back out of sight, dragging Evra with me.</p><p>I mouthed the words \"Say nothing,\" then cautiously peered around the corner to see what Mr. Crepsley was up to.</p><p>The vampire was tucked behind cardboard boxes that were stacked against one of the walls. I saw nobody else, but I could hear footsteps approaching.</p><p>The fat man appeared through a door. He was whistling and looking through some papers attached to a clipboard that he was carrying. He stopped at a large automated door and pressed a button in the wall. With a sharp, grinding noise, it opened.</p><p>The fat man hung the clipboard on a hook on the wall, then entered. I heard him press a button on the other side. The door stopped, creaked, and came down at the same slow pace with which it had gone up.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley darted forward as the door was closing and slid underneath.</p><p>\"Go back up to the room with the pipes and hide,\" I told Evra. He began to complain. \"Just do it!\" I snapped. \"He'd spot you here on his way back if you stayed. Go up and wait. I'll track you down if I'm able to stop him. If not...\" I found his hands and squeezed hard. \"It's been nice knowing you, Evra Von.\"</p><p>\"Be careful, Darren,\" Evra said, and I could see the fear in his eyes. Not fear for himself. Fear for me. \"Good luck.\"</p><p>\"I don't need luck,\" I said bravely and pulled out my knife. \"I've got this.\" Giving his hands another squeeze, I fled down the corridor and threw myself under the closing door, which shut right behind me, locking me in with the fat man and the vampire.</p><p>The room was full of animal carcasses, which hung on steel hooks from the ceiling. It was refrigerated, to keep the animals fresh.</p><p>The stench of blood was sickening. I knew the bodies were only those of animals, but I kept imagining they were humans.</p><p>The overhead lights were incredibly bright, so I had to move very carefully: a stray shadow could mean the end of me. The floor was slippery - water? blood? - so I had to watch where I put my feet.</p><p>There was a strange rosy glow around the carcasses, a result of the bright light and blood. You wouldn't want to be a vegetarian in a place like this!</p><p>After a few seconds of seeing nothing but dead animals, I spotted Mr. Crepsley and the fat man. I fell in behind the two and kept pace with them.</p><p>The fat man stopped and checked one of the carcasses. He must have been feeling cold, because he blew into his hands to warm them up, even though he was wearing gloves. He gave the dead animal a slap when he finished examining it - the hook creaked creepily as the carcass swung back and forth - and began to whistle the same tune he'd been whistling outside.</p><p>He started walking again.</p><p>I was closing the gap between myself and Mr. Crepsley - I didn't want to get left too far behind - when all of a sudden the fat man bent down to examine something on the ground. I stopped and began to move backward, afraid he'd spot my feet, then noticed Mr. Crepsley creeping up on the crouching human.</p><p>I swore underneath my breath and raced forward. If Mr. Crepsley had been paying attention, he would have heard me, but he was concentrating on the man ahead.</p><p>I stopped a few feet behind the vampire and drew out my rusty knife. That would have been the perfect time to attack - the vampire was standing still, focused on the human, unaware of my presence, an ideal target - but I couldn't. Mr. Crepsley had to make the first move. I refused to believe the worst about him until he actually attacked. As Evra had said, if I killed him, there could be no bringing him back to life. This was no time to make a mistake.</p><p>The seconds seemed like hours as the fat man crouched, studying whatever it was that had grabbed his attention. Finally he shrugged and stood up straight. I heard Mr. Crepsley hiss and saw his body tense. I raised my knife.</p><p>The fat man must have heard something, because he looked up - the wrong way; he should have been looking backward - an instant before Mr. Crepsley leaped.</p><p>I'd been anticipating the move, but even so, I was unprepared. If I'd lunged at the same time as the vampire, I would have been able to lash out with the knife and hit where I was aiming: his throat. As it was, I hesitated a split second, which meant I was off target.</p><p>I yelled as I bounded after him, screaming loudly, partly to shock him out of his attack, partly because I was so horrified by what I was doing.</p><p>The scream caused Mr. Crepsley to whip around. His eyes widened incredulously. Since he wasn't looking ahead any longer, he crashed awkwardly into the fat man and the two went sprawling to the ground.</p><p>I fell on Mr. Crepsley and struck with the knife. The blade cut into the top of the vampire's left arm and bit deeply into his flesh. He roared with pain and tried shoving me off. I pushed him down - he was in a difficult position, his extra weight and strength no use to him - and drew back my arm, meaning to bring the knife down with all my force in a long, lethal strike.</p><p>I never made the killer cut. Because, as my arm flew back, it connected with somebody. Somebody floating downward. Somebody who'd jumped from above. Somebody who screeched as my arm struck him, and rolled away from me as fast as he could.</p><p>Forgetting the vampire for a moment, I looked over my shoulder at the rolling figure. I could tell it was a man, but that was all I could tell until he stopped moving and got to his feet.</p><p>When he stood and looked at me, I found myself wishing he'd kept on rolling right out of the room.</p><p>He was a fearsome sight. A tall man. Broad and bloated. Dressed in white from head to ankle, an immaculate white suit, spoiled only by smudges of dirt and blood he'd picked up while rolling.</p><p>In total contrast to his white suit were his skin, hair, eyes, lips, and nails. The skin was a blotchy purple color. The rest were a dark, vibrant red, as though they'd been soaked in blood.</p><p>I didn't know who or what this creature was, but I could tell immediately that he was an agent of evil. It was written all over him, the way he stood, the way he sneered, the way madness danced in his unnatural red eyes, the way his ruby-red lips pulled back over his sharp, snarling teeth.</p><p>I heard Mr. Crepsley curse and scramble to his feet. Before he got up, the white-suited man bellowed and ran toward me at a speed no human could have managed. He lowered his head and butted me, almost rupturing the walls of my stomach, driving the wind out of me.</p><p>I flew backward into Mr. Crepsley, unwillingly driving him back to the floor.</p><p>The creature in white shrieked, hesitated a moment as though contemplating an attack, then grabbed hold of a carcass and dragged himself up. He leaped up high and grabbed hold of a windowsill - for the first time, I realized windows ran around the entire top of the room - smashed the glass, and slithered out.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley cursed again and shoved me out of the way. He mounted a carcass and jumped up to the windowsill after the purple-skinned man, wincing from the pain in his injured left arm. He hung there a moment, listening intently. Then his head dropped and his shoulders sagged.</p><p>The fat human - who'd been blubbering like a baby - got to his knees and began crawling away. Mr. Crepsley noticed him, and, after one last desperate look through the window, dropped to the ground and hurried over to the man, who was trying to rise.</p><p>I watched helplessly as Mr. Crepsley pulled the human up and glared into his face: if he was intent on killing the man, there was nothing I could do to stop him. My ribs felt as though they'd been battered by a ram. Breathing was painful. Moving was out of the question.</p><p>But Mr. Crepsley didn't have murder on his mind. All he did was breathe gas into the fat man's face, who stiffened, then slumped to the floor, unconscious.</p><p>Then Mr. Crepsley whirled and came toward me, rage in his eyes, the likes of which I'd never seen before. I began to worry about my own life. He picked me up and shook me like a doll. \"You idiot!\" he roared. \"You interfering, mindless fool! Do you realize what you have done? Do you?\"</p><p>\"I was... trying to... stop...\" I wheezed. \"I thought...\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley pressed his face against mine and growled: \"He has escaped! Because of your damned meddling, an insane killer has waltzed off scot-free! This was my chance to stop him and you... you...\"</p><p>He couldn't say any more: rage had seized his tongue. Dumping me to the ground, he spun away and sank to his knees, cursing and groaning - at times he seemed to be almost crying - with undisguised disgust.</p><p>I looked from the vampire to the sleeping human to the broken window, and realized (it hardly took a genius to figure it out) that I'd made a horrible - perhaps fatal - mistake.</p><p>Chapter FIFTEEN</p><p>There was a long, edgy period of silence, minutes passing slowly. I felt around my ribs - none were broken. I stood and gritted my teeth as my insides flared with pain. I'd be sore for days.</p><p>Making my way over to Mr. Crepsley, I cleared my throat. \"Who was that?\" I asked.</p><p>He glared at me and shook his head. \"Idiot!\" he growled. \"What were you doing here?\"</p><p>\"Trying to stop you from killing him,\" I said, pointing to the fat man. Mr. Crepsley stared at me. \"I heard about those six dead people on the news,\" I explained. \"I thought you were the killer. I trailed -?</p><p>\"You thought I was a murderer?\" Mr. Crepsley roared. I nodded glumly. \"You are even dumber than I thought! Do you have so little faith in me that you -?</p><p>\"What else was I supposed to think?\" I cried. \"You never tell me anything. You disappeared into the city every night, not saying a thing about where you were going or what you were doing. What was I supposed to think when I heard six people had been found drained of their blood?\"</p>","<p>Mr. Crepsley looked startled, then thoughtful. Finally he nodded wearily. \"You are right.\" He sighed. \"One must show trust in order to be trusted. I wished to spare you the gory details. I should not have. This is my fault.\"</p><p>\"That's okay,\" I said, taken aback by his gentle manner. \"I guess I shouldn't have come after you like I did.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley glanced at the knife. \"You meant to kill me?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said, embarrassed.</p><p>To my surprise, he laughed dryly. \"You are a reckless young man, Master Shan. But I knew that when I took you on as my assistant.\" He stood and examined the cut on his arm. \"I suppose I should be grateful that I did not come out of this even worse.\"</p><p>\"Will you be okay?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I will live,\" he said, rubbing spit into the cut to heal it.</p><p>I looked up at the broken window. \"Who was that?\" I asked again.</p><p>\"The question is not 'who, \" Mr. Crepsley said. \"The question is 'what. He is a vampaneze. His name is Murlough.\"</p><p>\"What's a vampaneze?\"</p><p>\"It is a long story. We do not have time. Later, I will -?</p><p>\"No,\" I said firmly. \"I almost killed you tonight because I didn't know what was going on. Tell me about it now, so there won't be any more mix-ups.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley hesitated, then nodded. \"Very well,\" he said. \"I suppose here is as good a place as any. I do not think we will be disturbed. But we dare not delay. I must give this unwelcome turn of events much thought and begin planning anew. I will be brief. Try not to ask unnecessary questions.\"</p><p>\"I'll try,\" I promised.</p><p>\"The vampaneze are...\" he searched for words. \"In olden nights, humans were looked down upon by many vampires, who fed on them as people feed on animals. It was not unusual for vampires to drink dry a couple of people a week. Over time, we decided this was not acceptable, so laws were established which forbade needless killing.</p><p>\"Most vampires were content to obey the laws - it is easier for us to pass unnoticed amongst humans if we do not kill them - but some felt our cause had been betrayed. Certain vampires believed humans were put on this planet for us to feed upon.\"</p><p>\"That's crazy!\" I shouted. \"Vampires start off as humans. What sort of -?</p><p>\"Please,\" Mr. Crepsley interrupted. \"I am only trying to explain how these vampires thought. I am not condoning their actions.</p><p>\"Seven hundred years ago, events came to a head. Seventy vampires broke away from the rest and declared themselves a separate race. They called themselves the vampaneze and established their own rules and governing bodies.</p><p>\"Basically, the vampaneze believe it is wrong to feed from a human without killing. They believe there is nobility in draining a person and absorbing their spirit - as you absorbed part of Sam Grest's when you drank from him - and that there is shame in taking small amounts, feeding like a leech.\"</p><p>\"So they always kill the people they drink from?\" I asked. Mr. Crepsley nodded. \"That's terrible!\"</p><p>\"I agree,\" the vampire said. \"So did most of the vampires when the vampaneze broke away. There was a huge war. Many vampaneze were killed. Many vampires were, too, but we were winning. We would have hunted them out of existence, except...\" He smiled bitterly. \"The humans we were trying to protect got in the way.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Many humans knew about vampires. But, as long as we did not kill them, they let us be - they were afraid of us. But when the vampaneze started slaughtering people, the humans panicked and fought back. Unfortunately they could not tell the difference between vampires and vampaneze, so both were tracked down and killed.</p><p>\"We could have handled the vampaneze,\" Mr. Crepsley said, \"but not the humans. They were on the verge of wiping us out. In the end, our Princes met with the vampaneze and a truce was agreed to. We would leave them alone if they stopped murdering so freely. They would only kill when they needed to feed and would do all they could to keep their murders secret from humanity.</p><p>\"The truce worked. When the humans realized they were safe, they stopped hunting us. The vampaneze traveled far away to avoid us - part of the agreement - and we have had virtually nothing to do with them for the last several centuries, apart from occasional clashes and challenges.\"</p><p>\" Challenges?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Vampires and vampaneze live roughly,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"We are forever testing ourselves in fights and competitions. Humans and animals are interesting opponents, but if a vampire really wants to test himself, he fights a vampaneze. It is common for vampires and vampaneze to seek each other out and fight to the death.\"</p><p>\"That's stupid,\" I said.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley shrugged. \"It is our way. Time has changed the vampaneze,\" he went on. \"You noticed the red hair and nails and eyes?\"</p><p>\"And lips,\" I added. \"And he had purple skin.\"</p><p>\"These changes have come about because they drink more blood than vampires. Most vampaneze are not as colorful as Murlough - he has been drinking dangerously large amounts of blood - but they all have similar markings. Except for young vampaneze - it takes a couple of decades for the colors to set in.\"</p><p>I thought over what I'd been told. \"So the vampaneze are evil? They're why vampires have such a bad reputation?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley rubbed his scar thoughtfully. \"To say they are evil is not entirely true. To humans, they are, but to vampires they are more misdirected cousins than out-and-out ghouls.\"</p><p>\" What?\" I couldn't believe he was defending them.</p><p>\"It depends on how one looks at it,\" he said. \"You have learned to take no notice of drinking from humans, yes?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said, \"but -?</p><p>\"Do you remember how against it you were in the beginning?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said again, \"but -?</p><p>\"To many humans, you are evil,\" he said. \"A young half-vampire who drinks human blood... how long do you think it would be before somebody tried to kill you if your true identity were known?\"</p><p>I chewed my lower lip and thought about his words.</p><p>\"Do not get me wrong,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"I do not approve of the vampaneze and their ways. But nor do I think they are evil.\"</p><p>\"You're saying it's okay to kill humans?\" I asked warily.</p><p>\"No,\" he disagreed. \"I am saying I can see their point. Vampaneze kill because of their beliefs, not because they enjoy it. A human soldier who kills in war is not evil, is he?\"</p><p>\"This isn't the same thing,\" I said.</p><p>\"But it falls along similarly murky lines. To humans, vampaneze are evil, plain and simple. But for vampires - and you belong to the vampire clan now - it is not so easy to judge. They are kin.</p><p>\"Also,\" he added, \"the vampaneze have their noble points. They are loyal and brave. And they never break their word - when a vampaneze makes a promise, he sticks by it. If a vampaneze lies and his kinsmen find out, they will execute him, no questions asked. They have their faults, and I have no personal liking for them, but evil?\" He sighed. \"That is hard to say.\"</p><p>I frowned. \"But you were going to kill this one,\" I reminded him.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley nodded. \"Murlough is not ordinary. Madness has invaded his mind. He has lost control and kills indiscriminately, feeding his lunatic lust. Were he a vampire, he would have been judged by the Generals and executed. The vampaneze, however, look more kindly upon their less fortunate members. They are loath to kill one of their own.</p><p>\"If a vampaneze loses his mind, he is ejected from the ranks and set loose. If he keeps clear of his kind, they make no move to hinder or harm him. He is -?</p><p>A groan made us jump. Looking behind, we saw the fat man stirring.</p><p>\"Come,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"We will continue our discussion on the way to the roof.\"</p><p>We let ourselves out of the refrigerated room and started back.</p><p>\"Murlough has been roaming the world for several years,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Normally, mad vampaneze do not last that long. They make silly mistakes and are soon caught and killed by humans. But Murlough is craftier than most. He still has sense enough to kill quietly and to hide the bodies. You know the myth about vampires not being able to enter a house unless they are invited inside?\"</p><p>\"Sure,\" I said. \"I never believed it.\"</p><p>\"Nor should you. But, like most myths, it has its roots in fact. The vampaneze almost never kill humans at home. They catch their prey outside, kill and feed, then hide the bodies, or disguise the wounds to make the death look accidental. Mad vampaneze normally forget these fundamental rules, but Murlough has remembered. That is how I knew he would not attack the man at home.\"</p><p>\"How did you know he was going to attack him at all?\" I asked.</p><p>\"The vampaneze are traditionalists,\" Mr. Crepsley explained. \"They select their victims in advance. They sneak into their houses while the humans are sleeping and mark them - three small scratches on the left cheek. Did you notice such marks on the fat man?\"</p><p>I shook my head. \"I wasn't looking.\"</p><p>\"They are there,\" Mr. Crepsley assured me. \"They are small - he probably thought he scratched himself while sleeping - but unmistakable once one knows what to look for: always in the same spot and always the same length.</p><p>\"That is how I latched onto this man. Until that night I had been searching blindly, scouring the city, hoping to stumble across Murlough's trail. I spotted the fat man by chance and followed him. I knew the attack would come either here or on his way home from work, so it was just a matter of sitting back and waiting for Murlough to make his move.\" The vampire's face darkened. \"Then you arrived on the scene.\" He was unable to keep the bitterness out of his voice.</p><p>\"Will you be able to find Murlough again?\" I asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \"Discovering the marked human was a stroke of incredible good fortune. It will not happen twice. Besides, though Murlough is mad, he is no fool. He will abandon any humans he has already marked and flee this city.\" Mr. Crepsley sighed unhappily. \"I suppose I will have to settle for that.\"</p><p>\" Settlefor it?\" I asked. \"Aren't you going to follow him?\" Mr. Crepsley shook his head. I stopped on the landing - we were almost at the door of the room with the pipes - and stared at him, aghast. \"Why not?\" I barked. \"He's crazy! He's killing people! You've got to -?</p><p>\"It is not my business,\" the vampire said gently. \"It is not my place to worry about creatures such as Murlough.\"</p><p>\"Then why get involved?\" I cried, thinking of all the people the mad vampaneze was going to kill.</p><p>\"The hands of the Vampire Generals are tied in matters such as these,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"They dare not take steps to eliminate mad vampaneze, for fear of sparking an all-out war. As I said, vampaneze are loyal. They would seek revenge for the murder of one of their own. We can kill vampaneze in a fair fight, but if a General killed a mad vampaneze, his allies would feel compelled to strike back.</p><p>\"I got involved because this is the city where I was born. I lived here as a human. Though everyone I knew then has long since died, I feel attached - this city, more than any other place, is where I consider home.</p><p>\"Gavner Purl knew this. When he realized Murlough was here, he set about tracking me down. He guessed - correctly - that I would not be able to sit back and let the mad vampaneze wreak havoc. It was a sly move on his part, but I do not blame him - in his position, I would have done the same.\"</p><p>\"I don't get it,\" I said. \"I thought the Vampire Generals wanted to avoid a war.\"</p><p>\"They do.\"</p><p>\"But if you'd killed Murlough, wouldn't -?</p><p>\"No,\" he interrupted. \"I am not a General. I am a mere vampire, with no connection to any others. The vampaneze would have come after me if they learned I had killed him, but the Generals would not have been implicated. It would have been personal. It would not have led to war.\"</p><p>\"I see. So, now that your city is safe, you don't care about him anymore?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Mr. Crepsley said simply.</p><p>I couldn't agree with the vampire's position - I'd have hunted Murlough down to the ends of the Earth - but I could understand it. He'd been protecting ?his? people. Now that the threat against them had been removed, he no longer considered the vampaneze his problem. It was a typical piece of vampire logic.</p><p>\"What happens now?\" I asked. \"We go back to the Cirque Du Freak and forget about this?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" he said. \"Murlough will avoid this city in the future. He will slope away into the night and that will be that. We can return to our lives and get on with them.\"</p><p>\"Until next time,\" I said.</p><p>\"I have only one home,\" the vampire responded. \"In all likelihood, there will be no next time. Come,\" he said. \"If you have further questions, I will answer them later.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\" I paused. \"What we said earlier - about no more holding important stuff back - is that still on? Will you trust me now and tell me things?\"</p><p>The vampire smiled. \"We will trust each other,\" he said.</p><p>I returned his smile and followed him into the room with the pipes.</p><p>\"How come I didn't spot Murlough's footsteps earlier?\" I asked, retracing the marks we'd made on our way into the building.</p><p>\"He entered via a different route,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"I did not want to get close to him until he made his move, in case he saw me.\"</p><p>I was on my way out of the window when I remembered Evra.</p>","<p>\"Hold on!\" I called Mr. Crepsley back. \"We've got to get Evra.\"</p><p>\"The snake-boy knew about this, too?\" Mr. Crepsley laughed. \"Hurry and get him. But do not expect me to tell the story again on his behalf. I will leave such details to you.\"</p><p>I cast around for my friend.</p><p>\"Evra,\" I called quietly. When there was no response I shouted a little louder. \"Evra!\" Where was he hiding? I glanced down and found a lone pair of footprints in the dust, leading away under a mass of pipes.</p><p>\"Evra!\" I shouted again, starting after his trail. He'd probably seen me talking with the vampire and wasn't sure what was going on. \"It's okay,\" I yelled. Mr. Crepsley isn't the killer. It's another -?</p><p>There was a sharp crunching noise as my foot came down on something and crushed it. Taking a step back, I bent and picked up the object for a closer look. With a sinking feeling in my gut, I realized what it was - the broken remains of a cellular phone.</p><p>\"Evra!\" I screamed, rushing forward. I saw signs of a scuffle farther on - the dust in this area had been severely disturbed, like somebody had been thrashing around in it. Thousands of dust particles were drifting in unsettled clouds through the air.</p><p>\"What is it?\" Mr. Crepsley asked, approaching warily. I showed him the crushed phone. \"Evra's?\" he guessed.</p><p>I nodded. \"The vampaneze must have got him,\" I said, horrified.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley sighed and hung his head. \"Then Evra is dead,\" he said bluntly, and kept his gaze lowered as I started to cry.</p><p>Chapter SIXTEEN</p><p>Mr. Crepsley checked us out of the hotel as soon as we got back, in case the staff noticed Evra's disappearance, or the vampaneze forced him to reveal our location.</p><p>\"What if he escapes?\" I asked. \"How will he know where to find us?\"</p><p>\"I do not believe he will escape,\" Mr. Crepsley said regretfully.</p><p>We checked into a new hotel not far from the old one. If the man behind the desk was surprised to find a solemn-looking man with a scar and a distraught young boy in a pirate costume checking in at such a strange hour, he kept his suspicions to himself.</p><p>I begged Mr. Crepsley to tell me more about the vampaneze. He said they never drank from vampires - our blood was poisonous to other vampires and vampaneze. They lived slightly longer than vampires, though the difference was minimal. They ate very little food, preferring to keep going on blood. They only drank from animals as a last resort.</p><p>I listened closely. It was easier not to think about Evra if I had something else to focus on. But when dawn came and Mr. Crepsley headed for bed, I was left alone to think about what had happened.</p><p>I watched the sunrise. I was tired, but I couldn't sleep. How could I face the nightmares that must be waiting for me? I fixed a huge breakfast, but my appetite was gone after one small mouthful and I ended up tossing it. I turned on the TV and flicked between channels, barely noticing what was on.</p><p>Every so often I'd think it must have been a dream. Evra couldn't be dead. I must have fallen asleep on the roof while watching Mr. Crepsley and dreamt it all. Any minute now, Evra would shake me awake. I'd tell him about my dream and we'd both laugh. \"You won't get rid of me that easily,\" he'd say.</p><p>But it wasn't a dream. I had come face to face with the vampaneze. He had abducted Evra. He had either killed him or was preparing to. These were facts and had to be faced.</p><p>The trouble was, I didn't dare face them. I was afraid I might go crazy if I did. So, rather than accept the truth and deal with it, I buried it deep, where it couldn't bother me - then went to see Debbie. Maybe she could cheer me up.</p><p>Debbie was playing in the square when I arrived. It had snowed heavily during the night and she was building a snowman with some of the local kids. She was surprised but happy to see me so early. She introduced me to her friends, who looked at me inquisitively.</p><p>\"Want to come for a walk?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Can it wait till I finish the snowman?\" she replied.</p><p>\"No,\" I said. \"I'm restless. I need to walk. I can come back later if you want.\"</p><p>\"That's all right. I'll come.\" She looked at me weirdly. \"Are you okay? Your face is as white as a sheet, and your eyes... have you been crying?\"</p><p>\"I was peeling onions earlier,\" I lied.</p><p>Debbie turned to her friends. \"See you later,\" she said, and took my arm. \"Anywhere special you want to go?\"</p><p>\"Not really,\" I said. \"You lead. I'll tag along.\"</p><p>We didn't say much while we were walking, until Debbie tugged my arm and said, \"I've got some good news. I asked Mom and Dad if you could come over on Christmas Eve to help put up the decorations and they said you could.\"</p><p>\"Great,\" I said, forcing a smile.</p><p>\"They've invited you for dinner, too,\" she said. \"They were going to ask you over for Christmas Day, but I know you've made plans to spend it in the hotel. Besides, I don't think your dad would want to come, would he?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said softly.</p><p>\"But Christmas Eve's okay, isn't it?\" she asked. \"Evra can come, too. We'll be eating early, at about two or three in the afternoon, so there'll be plenty of time for decorating the trees. You can -?</p><p>\"Evra won't be able to come,\" I said shortly.</p><p>\"Why not?\"</p><p>I found myself struggling to think up a good lie. Finally, I said, \"He's got the flu. He's in bed and can't move.\"</p><p>\"He seemed fine yesterday.\" Debbie frowned. \"I saw the two of you going out last night. He looked -?</p><p>\"How did you see us?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Through the window,\" she said. \"It's not the first time I've noticed you going out after dark. I never said anything about it before, because I thought you would have told me what you were up to if you'd wanted me to know.\"</p><p>\"It's not nice to spy on people,\" I snapped.</p><p>\"I wasn't spying!\" Debbie looked hurt by my accusation and tone. \"I just happened to see you. And if that's going to be your attitude, you can forget Christmas Eve.\" She turned to leave.</p><p>\"Wait,\" I said, catching her arm (careful not to grab too hard). \"I'm sorry. I'm in a really bad mood. I don't feel so good. Maybe I've picked up something from Evra.\"</p><p>\"You do look under the weather,\" she agreed, her face softening.</p><p>\"As for where we go at night, it's just to meet our dad,\" I said. \"We join him after work and go out for something to eat, or to see a movie. I would have invited you along, but you know how things stand with my dad.\"</p><p>\"You should introduce us,\" Debbie said. \"I bet I'd be able to get him to like me, if I only had the chance.\"</p><p>We started walking again.</p><p>\"So, how about Christmas Eve?\" she asked.</p><p>I shook my head. Sitting down to dinner with Debbie and her parents was the last thing I wanted to think about. \"I'll have to get back to you on that one.\" I said. \"I'm not sure if we'll be here. We might be moving on.\"</p><p>\"But Christmas Eve is tomorrow!\" Debbie exclaimed. \"Your dad must have told you his plans by now.\"</p><p>\"He's strange,\" I said. \"He likes to leave things till the very last minute. I could arrive back after this walk and find him packed and ready to go.\"</p><p>\"He can't leave if Evra's sick,\" she said.</p><p>\"He can and will, if he wants,\" I told her.</p><p>Debbie frowned and stopped walking. There was a street vent a foot or so away, and warm air was blowing out of it. She moved closer and stood on the bars. \"You won't leave without telling me, will you?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Of course not,\" I said.</p><p>\"I'd hate it if you disappeared into thin air without a word,\" she said, and I could see tears gathering in the corners of her eyes.</p><p>\"I promise,\" I said. \"When I know I'm leaving, you'll know, too. Word of honor.\" I crossed my heart.</p><p>\"Come here,\" she said, and pulled close and gave me a big hug.</p><p>\"What was that for?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Does there have to be a reason?\" she smiled, then pointed ahead. \"Let's turn at the next corner. That'll lead us back to the square.\"</p><p>I took Debbie's arm, meaning to walk her back, then remembered I'd changed hotels. If I returned to the square, she'd expect me to go in the hotel. She might get suspicious if she spotted me sneaking away.</p><p>\"I'll keep walking,\" I said. \"I'll call tonight or in the morning to let you know whether I can come over or not.\"</p><p>\"If your dad wants to leave, try twisting his arm to get him to stay,\" she suggested. \"I'd really love to have you over.\"</p><p>\"I'll try,\" I vowed, and watched through sad eyes as she walked to the corner and turned out of sight.</p><p>It was then that I heard a soft chuckling noise beneath my feet. Glancing down through the bars of the vent I saw nobody and thought I must have been hearing things. But then a voice came up out of the shadows.</p><p>\"I like your girlfriend, Darren Shan,\" it said with a giggle, and I knew instantly who was down there. \"A very tasty dish. Good enough to eat, wouldn't you say? Much tastier-looking than your other friend. Much tastier than Evra.\"</p><p>It was Murlough- the mad vampaneze!</p><p>Chapter SEVENTEEN</p><p>I dropped to my knees and peered through the bars of the vent. It was dark down there, but after a few seconds I was able to make out the rough figure of the fat vampaneze.</p><p>\"What's your girlfriend's name, hmmm?\" Murlough asked. \"Anne? Beatrice? Catherine? Diane? Elsa? Franny? Geraldine? Henrietta? Eileen? Josie - \" He stopped and I could sense him frowning. \"No. Wait. Eileen begins with an 'E, not an 'I. Are there any women's names beginning with T? I can't think of any offhand. How about you, Darren Shan? Any ideas, hmmm? Any notions?\" He pronounced my first name weirdly, so that it rhymed with Jarwren.</p><p>\"How did you find me?\" I gasped.</p><p>\"That was easy.\" He leaned forward, carefully avoiding the rays of sunlight, and tapped the side of his head. \"Used my brains,\" he said. \"Young Murlough's got plenty of brains, yes he does. I played a tune on your friend - Snakey Von. He told me where the hotel was. I set up camp outside. Watched carefully. Saw you passing with your girlfriend, so I followed.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean, 'Played a tune'?\" I asked.</p><p>The vampaneze laughed out loud. \"With my knife,\" he explained. \"My knife and a few sets of scales. Get it? Scales. Scales on Snakey, scales on a piano. Ha! Brains, I told you, brains! A stupid man couldn't make jokes so cunning, jokes so shrewd. Young Murlough has brains the size of -?</p><p>\"Where's Evra?\" I interrupted, pounding the bars of the vent to shut him up. I gave them a yank, to see if I could get down to him, but they were sealed firmly in the ground.</p><p>\"Evra? Evra Von?\" Murlough did a strange little half-dance in the darkness underneath the vent. \"Evra's strapped up,\" he told me. \"Hanging by his ankles. Blood rushing to his head. Squealing like a piggie. Begging to be let free.\"</p><p>\"Where is he?\" I asked desperately. \"Is he alive?\"</p><p>\"Tell me,\" he said, ignoring my questions, \"where are you and the vampire staying? You've moved hotels, haven't you? That's why I didn't see you coming out. What were you doing in the square, anyway? No!\" he shouted as I opened my mouth to speak. \"Don't tell me, don't tell me! Give the brains a chance to work. Young Murlough's got plenty of brains. Brains oozing out his ears, some would say.\"</p><p>He paused, his little eyes darting back and forth, then snapped his fingers and squealed. \"The girl! Darren Shan's little friend! She lives in the square, hmmm? You wanted to see her. Which house is hers? Don't tell me, don't tell me! I'll figure it out. I'll track her down. Juicy-looking girl. Plenty of blood, hmmm? Lovely salty blood. I can taste her already.\"</p><p>\"Stay away from her!\" I screamed. \"If you go near her, I'll -?</p><p>\"Shut up!\" the vampaneze barked. \"Don't threaten me! I won't take lip from a runtish half-vampire like you. Any more like that and I'm off, and that'll be the end of Snakey.\"</p><p>I brought myself under control. \"Does that mean he's still alive?\" I asked shakily.</p><p>Murlough grinned and tapped his nose. \"Maybe he is, maybe he isn't. No way for you to know for sure, is there?\"</p><p>\"Mr. Crepsley said vampaneze have to keep their word,\" I said. \"If you give me your word that he's alive, then I'll know.\"</p><p>Murlough nodded slowly. \"He's alive.\"</p><p>\"You give me your word?\"</p><p>\"I give you my word,\" he said. \"Snakey's alive. Tied up and strung up. Squealing like a piggie. I'm keeping him for Christmas. He'll be my Christmas dinner. Snakey instead of turkey. Do you think that's foul of me, hmmm?\" He laughed. \"Get it? Foul. Not one of my subtler jokes, but it'll do. Snakey laughed. Snakey does everything I tell him to. You would, too, in his position. Dangling by his ankles. Squealing like a piggie.\"</p><p>Murlough had an irritating way of repeating himself.</p><p>\"Look,\" I said, \"let Evra go. Please, he's never hurt you.\"</p><p>\"He interfered with my schedule!\" the vampaneze shrieked. \"I was ready to feed. It was going to be glorious. I would have drained the fat man, then skinned him alive and stuck his corpse up with the rest in the cold room. Made cannibals of some poor unsuspecting humans. It would have been great sport, hmmm?\"</p><p>\"Evra didn't get in your way,\" I said. \"That was me and Mr. Crepsley. Evra was outside.\"</p>","<p>\"Inside, outside - he wasn't on my side. But he soon will be.\" Murlough licked his blood-red lips.</p><p>\"On my side and in my tummy. I never had snake-boy before. I'm looking forward to it. Maybe I'll stuff him before feeding. Make it more Christmasy.\"</p><p>\"I'll kill you!\" I screamed, tugging at the vent again, losing my self-control. \"I'll track you down and tear you apart, limb from limb!\"</p><p>\"Oh, my!\" Murlough laughed, pretending to be scared. \"Oh, heavens! Please don't hurt me, nasty little half-vampire. Young Murlough's a good guy. Say you'll leave me be.\"</p><p>\"Where's Evra?\" I roared. \"Bring him up here now, or I'll -?</p><p>\"All right,\" Murlough snapped, \"that's enough! I didn't come here to be shouted at, no I didn't. There's plenty of other places I can go if I want people shouting at me, hmmm? Now shut up and listen.\"</p><p>It took a lot of effort, but I finally managed to calm down.</p><p>\"Good,\" Murlough grunted. \"That's better. You're not as stupid as most vampires. A little brains in Darren Shan, hmmm? Not as smart as me, of course, but who is? Young Murlough's got more brains than... \"Enough.\" He dug his nails into the wall beneath the vent and climbed up a couple of feet. \"Listen carefully.\" He sounded sane now. \"I don't know how you found me - Snakey couldn't tell me, no matter how many scales I played - and I don't care. That's your secret. Keep it. We all need secrets, don't we, hmmm?</p><p>\"And I don't care about the human,\" he went on. \"He was just a meal. Plenty more where he came from. Plenty more blood in the fleshy human sea.</p><p>\"I don't even care about you,\" he snorted. \"Half-vampires don't interest me. You were only following your master. You don't worry me. I'm prepared to let you live. You and Snakey and the human.</p><p>\"But the vampire - Larten Crepsley.\" The vampaneze's red eyes filled with hate. \" HimI care about. He should have known better than to get in my way. Vampires and vampaneze don't mix!\" he roared at the top of his voice. \"Even the fools of the world know that! It's been agreed upon. We don't interfere with one another's ways. He broke the laws. He must be made to pay.\"</p><p>\"He broke no law,\" I said defiantly. \"You're crazy. You were killing people all over the city. You had to be stopped.\"</p><p>\" Crazy?\" I'd expected Murlough to react furiously to the insult, but he only chuckled. \"Is that what he told you? Crazy? Young Murlough isn't crazy! I'm as sane a vampaneze as ever walked. Would I be here if I was crazy? Would I have had sense enough to keep Snakey alive? Do you see me foaming at the mouth? Do you hear me babbling like an idiot? Hmmm?\"</p><p>I decided to humor him. \"Maybe not,\" I said. \"You seem pretty smart now that I think about it.\"</p><p>\"Of course I'm smart! Young Murlough's got brains. Can't be crazy if you've got brains, not unless you get rabies. See any rabid animals?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said.</p><p>\"There you are!\" he declared triumphantly. \"No crazy animals, so no crazy Murlough. You follow, hmmm?\"</p><p>\"I follow,\" I said quietly.</p><p>\"Why did he interfere?\" Murlough asked. He sounded confused and annoyed. \"I wasn't doing anything to him. I wouldn't have gotten in his way. Why did he have to go and mess things up?\"</p><p>\"This used to be his city,\" I explained. \"He lived here when he was a human. He felt like it was his duty to protect the people.\"</p><p>Murlough stared at me in complete disbelief. \"You mean he did it for them?\" he screeched. \"The blood-carriers?\" He laughed crazily. \"He must be a loony! I thought maybe he wanted them for himself. Or else I killed somebody close to him. I never for a second thought he did it because of... of...\"</p><p>Murlough started laughing. \"That clinches it,\" he said. \"I can't let a lunatic like that run around. No telling what he'll be up to next. Listen to me, Darren Shan. You look like a smart boy. Let's you and me make a deal. Figure this mess out, hmmm?\"</p><p>\"What kind of a deal?\" I asked suspiciously.</p><p>\"A swap,\" Murlough said. \"I know where Snakey is. You know where the vampire is. One for the other. What do you say?\"</p><p>\"Give up Mr. Crepsley for Evra?\" I sneered. \"What kind of a deal is that? Exchange one friend for another? You can't believe I'd -?</p><p>\"Why not?\" Murlough asked. \"The snake-boy is innocent, hmmm? Your best friend, he told me. The vampire's the one who took you away from your family, from your home. Evra told me you hated him.\"</p><p>\"That was a long time ago,\" I said.</p><p>\"Even so,\" the vampaneze went on, \"if you had to choose between the two, who would you pick? If their lives hung in the balance and you could only save one, who would it be?\"</p><p>I didn't have to consider that very long. \"Evra,\" I said evenly.</p><p>\"There you are!\" Murlough boomed.</p><p>\"But Mr. Crepsley's life isn't in danger,\" I said. \"You want me to use him to get Evra off the hook.\" I shook my head sadly. \"I don't do that. I won't betray him or lead him into a trap.\"</p><p>\"You don't have to,\" Murlough said. \"Just tell me where he is. The name of the hotel and his room number. I'll do the rest. I'll sneak in while he's sleeping, do the business, then take you to get Evra. I give you my word that I'll let both of you go. Think about it, hmmm? Weigh the options. The vampire or Snakey. Your choice.\"</p><p>Again I shook my head. \"No. There's nothing to think about. I'll swap places with Evra myself, if that -?</p><p>\"I don't care about you!\" Murlough screamed. \"It's the vampire I want. What would I do with a stupid little half-vampire? Can't drink from you. Nothing to gain by killing you. It's Crepsley or no deal.\"</p><p>\"Then it's no deal,\" I said, sobs rising in my throat as I considered what my words meant for Evra.</p><p>Murlough spat at me in disgust. His spit bounced back off the vent. \"You're a fool,\" he snarled. \"I thought you were smart, but you're not. So be it. I'll find the vampire myself. Your girlfriend, too. I'll kill them both. Then I'll kill you. Wait and see if I don't.\"</p><p>The vampaneze let go of the wall and dropped into the darkness. \"Think of me, Darren Shan,\" he shouted as he slipped away down a tunnel. \"Think of me when Christmas comes around, as you're biting into your turkey and ham. Do you know what I'll be biting into? Do you?\" His laugh echoed eerily as he waltzed away down the tunnel.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said softly. I knew exactly what he'd be biting into.</p><p>Rising to my feet, I wiped the tears from my face, then took off to wake Mr. Crepsley and tell him about my meeting with Murlough. After a couple of minutes, I climbed up a fire escape and traveled over the rooftops, just in case the vampaneze had stuck around in hopes of following me back.</p><p>Chapter EIGHTEEN</p><p>Mr. Crepsley wasn't surprised that Murlough had been watching the hotel - he'd half expected it - but was stunned that I'd gone back to the square.</p><p>\"What were you thinking?\" he snapped.</p><p>\"You didn't warn me to stay away,\" I replied. \"I did not think I needed to.\"</p><p>He groaned. \"What could have possessed you to return?\"</p><p>I decided it was time to tell him about Debbie. He listened wordlessly as I explained.</p><p>\"A girlfriend,\" he said at the end, shaking his head in wonder. \"Why did you think I would disapprove? There is no reason you should not befriend a girl. Even full vampires sometimes fall in love with humans. It is complicated, and not to be recommended, but there is nothing wrong with it.\"</p><p>\"You're not angry?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Why should I be? Matters of your heart are no concern of mine. You acted properly: you made no promises you could not keep, and you remained aware of the fact that it could only be temporary. All that worries me about your friendship with this girl is how it ties in with the vampaneze.\"</p><p>\"You think Murlough will go after her?\"</p><p>\"I doubt it,\" he said. \"I think he will stay clear of the square. Now that we know he has been there, he will expect us to check on the area in the future. However, you should be careful. Do not go to see her when it is dark. Enter by the back door. Keep away from the windows.\"</p><p>\"It's okay for me to keep meeting her?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Yes.\" He smiled. \"I know you think I often spoil the fun, but I would never intentionally make you feel miserable.\"</p><p>I smiled back gratefully.</p><p>\"And Evra?\" I asked. \"What will happen to him?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley's smile faded. \"I am not sure.\" He thought about it for a couple of minutes. \"You truly refused to swap my life for his?\" He sounded as if he thought I might be making it up to impress him.</p><p>\"Honestly,\" I said.</p><p>\"But why?\"</p><p>I shrugged. \"We said we'd trust each other, remember?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley turned aside and coughed into his fist. When he faced me again, he looked ashamed of himself. \"I have gravely underestimated you, Darren,\" he said. \"I will not do so again. I made a wiser choice than I realized when I chose you to serve as my assistant. I feel honored to have you by my side.\"</p><p>The compliment made me feel awkward - I wasn't used to the vampire saying nice things - so I grimaced and tried to make nothing out of it.</p><p>\"What about Evra?\" I asked again.</p><p>\"We shall do what we can to rescue him,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"It is unfortunate that you refused to swap me for him: had we known Murlough would make the offer, we could have laid a trap. Now that you have shown loyalty toward me, he will not offer again. Our best chance to beat him has slipped away.</p><p>\"But there is hope yet,\" he said. \"Today is the twenty-third. We know that Evra will not be killed before the twenty-fifth.\"</p><p>\"Unless Murlough changes his mind,\" I said.</p><p>\"Unlikely. The vampaneze are not renowned for being indecisive. If he said he would not kill Evra until Christmas Day, that is when he will kill him. We have all tonight and tomorrow night to search for his lair.\"</p><p>\"But he could be anywhere in the city!\" I cried.</p><p>\"I disagree,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"He is not in the city - he is under it. Holed up in the tunnels. The drainpipes. The sewers. Hiding from the sun, free to move about as he wishes.\"</p><p>\"You can't know that for sure,\" I said. \"He might have only been down there today in order to follow me.\"</p><p>\"If he was,\" Mr. Crepsley said, \"we are sunk. But if he has made his base down there, we stand a chance. Space is not so plentiful beneath the ground. Noises are easier to detect. It will not be easy, but there is hope. Last night, we did not even have that.</p><p>\"If all else fails,\" he added, \"and we end up empty-handed...\" His face hardened. \"I will call to our murderous cousin and offer him the deal which you yourself put to him earlier.\"</p><p>\"You mean...?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" he said darkly. \"If we do not find Evra in time, I will trade my life for his.\"</p><p>There was more space beneath the ground than Mr. Crepsley had predicted. It was an endless, twisting maze down there. The pipes seemed to go everywhere, like they were thrown down at random. Some were big enough to stand in, others barely large enough to crawl through. Many of them were in use, half full of streams of water and waste. Others were old and dried-up and cracked.</p><p>The stench was terrible. One thing was certain: we might happen to hear or glimpse Murlough or Evra, but we'd definitely never be able to sniff them out!</p><p>The place was awash with rats and spiders and insects. But I soon discovered that if you ignored them, they generally ignored you back.</p><p>\"I do not understand why they need so many tunnels,\" Mr. Crepsley said grimly, after several hours of fruitless searching. We seemed to have walked halfway across the city, but when he stuck his head above ground to check our position, he discovered we'd gone less than three-quarters of a mile.</p><p>\"I guess different tunnels were made at different times,\" I said. My dad used to work for a construction company and had explained a little about underground systems to me. \"They wear out in places, eventually, and it's usually easier to dig new shafts than go back and patch up the old ones.\"</p><p>\"What a waste,\" Mr. Crepsley grumbled disdainfully. \"You could fit a small town into the space these damned pipes are taking up.\" He looked around. \"There seem to be more holes than concrete,\" he said. \"I am surprised the city has not fallen in upon itself.\"</p><p>After a while, Mr. Crepsley stopped and cursed.</p><p>\"Do you want to stop?\" I asked.</p><p>\"No,\" he sighed. \"We shall continue. It is better to search than sit back and wait. At least this way we are exerting some sort of control over our destiny.\"</p><p>We used torches in the tunnels. We needed some kind of light: even vampires can't see in total darkness. The beams increased the chances of Murlough's spotting us before we spotted him, but that was a risk we had to take.</p><p>\"There's no way of hunting him down telepathically, is there?\" I asked as we paused for a break. All this crawling and crouching was exhausting. \"Couldn't you search for his thoughts?\"</p><p>The vampire shook his head. \"I have no connection with Murlough,\" he said. \"Tuning into a person's mental signals requires radarlike emissions on both sides.\" He held up his two index fingers about a foot apart. \"Say this is me.\" He wiggled his right finger. \"This is Mr. Tall.\" He wiggled the left. \"Many years ago, we learned to recognize each other's mental waves. Now, if I want to find Mr. Tall, I emit a radar-like series of waves.\" He bent his right finger up and down. \"When these signals connect with Hibernius, part of his mind automatically signals back, even if his conscious mind remains unaware of it.\"</p>","<p>\"You mean you could find him even if he didn't want to be found?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley nodded. \"That is why most people refuse to share their wave identity. You should only reveal it to one you truly trust. Less than ten people on Earth can find me that way, or I them.\" He smiled thinly. \"Needless to say, none of those ten is a vampaneze.\"</p><p>I wasn't sure I understood completely about mental waves, but I'd taken in enough information to know Mr. Crepsley couldn't use it to find Evra.</p><p>One more hope struck from the list.</p><p>But the conversation made me start thinking. I was sure there must be some way of bettering the odds. Mr. Crepsley's plan - to roam the tunnels and pray we fell upon the vampaneze - was weak. Was there nothing else we could do? No way to prepare a trap and lure Murlough into it?</p><p>I focused my immediate thoughts on the search - if we stumbled upon the crazy vampaneze, I didn't want to be caught with my head in the clouds - but devoted the rest to serious thinking.</p><p>Something the vampaneze had said was poking away at the back of my brain, but I couldn't put my finger on it. I went back over everything he'd said. We'd talked about Evra and Mr. Crepsley and Debbie and making a deal and...</p><p>Debbie.</p><p>He'd teased me about her, said he was going to kill her and drink from her. At the time I didn't think it was a serious threat, but the more I thought about it, the more I began to wonder how much he really was interested in her.</p><p>He would be hungry, down here in the depths. He was used to feeding regularly. We'd ruined his schedule. He'd said he was looking forward to drinking Evra's blood, but was he? Vampires couldn't drink from snakes and I was willing to bet vampaneze couldn't, either. Maybe Evra's blood would prove to be undrinkable. Maybe Murlough would only be able to kill the snake-boy on Christmas Day, not drink from him as he planned. He'd commented a couple of times on how tasty Debbie looked. Was that a clue that Evra didn't look tasty?</p><p>As the time ticked by, thoughts turned over in my head. I didn't say anything when Mr. Crepsley told me we should return to the surface (he had a natural built-in clock), in case Murlough was shadowing us and listening to our every word. I kept quiet as we climbed out of the tunnel and trudged through the streets and then went up to the roofs again. I held my tongue as we snuck through our hotel window and sank into chairs, tired, miserable, and gloomy.</p><p>But then, hesitantly, I coughed to attract the vampire's attention. \"I think I have a plan,\" I said, and slowly spelled it out for him.</p><p>Chapter NINETEEN</p><p>Jesse answered the phone when I called Debbie's house. I asked if I could speak to her. \"You could if she was up.\" He laughed. \"Do you know what time it is?\"</p><p>I checked my watch: a few minutes before seven A.M. \"Oh,\" I said, crestfallen. \"Sorry. I didn't realize. Did I wake you?\"</p><p>\"No,\" he said. \"I have to head into the office, so it's business as usual for me. You just caught me, in fact - I was on my way out the door when the phone rang.\"</p><p>\"You're working on Christmas Eve?\"</p><p>\"No rest for the wicked.\" He laughed. \"But I'll only be there a couple of hours. Tying up some loose ends before the Christmas break. I'll be back in plenty of time for dinner. Speaking of which, are we to expect you or not?\"</p><p>\"Yes, please,\" I said. \"That's why I was calling, to say I could come.\"</p><p>\"Great!\" He sounded genuinely pleased. \"How about Evra?\"</p><p>\"Can't make it,\" I said. \"He's still not feeling well.\"</p><p>\"Too bad. Listen, do you want me to wake Debbie? I can -?</p><p>\"That's okay,\" I said quickly. \"Just let her know I'll be there. Two o'clock?\"</p><p>\"Two's fine,\" Jesse said. \"See you later, Darren.\"</p><p>\"Bye, Jesse.\"</p><p>I hung up and went straight to bed. My head was still buzzing from all the talking me and Mr. Crepsley had been doing, but I forced my eyes shut and concentrated on sweet thoughts. A few minutes later, my tired body drifted off to sleep and I slept like a baby until one in the afternoon, when the alarm clock went off.</p><p>My ribs were aching as I got up, and my stomach was purple and blue with bruises where Murlough had head-butted me. It wasn't too bad after a few minutes of walking around, but I was careful not to make any sudden movements and bent down as little as possible.</p><p>I had a good shower, then sprayed deodorant all over myself when I was dry - the smell of the sewers was hard to get rid of. I dressed and picked up a bottle of wine Mr. Crepsley had bought for me to give to Debbie's parents.</p><p>I knocked on Debbie's back door as Mr. Crepsley had advised. Donna opened it. \"Darren!\" she said, kissing me on both cheeks. \"Merry Christmas!\"</p><p>\"Merry Christmas,\" I replied.</p><p>\"Why didn't you use the front door?\" she asked.</p><p>\"I didn't want to dirty your carpets,\" I said, scraping my shoes on the mat inside the door. \"My shoes are wet from the dirty slush.\"</p><p>\"Silly.\" She smiled. \"As if anyone cares about carpets at Christmas. Debbie!\" she called upstairs. \"There's a handsome pirate here to see you.\"</p><p>\"Hi,\" Debbie said, coming down the stairs. She kissed me on both cheeks as well. \"Dad told me you called. What's in the bag?\"</p><p>I pulled out the bottle of wine. \"For your parents,\" I said. \"My dad gave it to me to bring over.\"</p><p>\"Oh, Darren, that's sweet,\" said Donna. She took the wine and called to Jesse, \"Look what Darren brought.\"</p><p>\"Ah! Vino!\" Jesse's eyes lit up. \"Better than the wine we bought. We invited the right man over. We should have him around more often. Where's the corkscrew?\"</p><p>\"Wait awhile.\" Donna laughed. \"Dinner isn't ready yet. I'll stick it in the fridge. You head for the living room. I'll yell when it's time.\"</p><p>We ate some cheese and crackers while we were waiting, and Debbie asked me if my dad had decided about moving on yet. I said he had, and that we were leaving tonight.</p><p>\" Tonight?\" She looked dismayed. \"Nobody travels anywhere except home on Christmas Eve. I should go over to that hotel, drag him out, and -?</p><p>\"That's where we're going,\" I interrupted. \"Home. Mom and Dad are getting together again, just for Christmas Day, to give Evra and me a treat. It's supposed to be a surprise, but I heard him on the phone this morning. That's why I called so early - I was excited.\"</p><p>\"Oh.\" I could tell Debbie was upset by the news, but she put on a brave face. \"That's great. I bet it's the best present you could have hoped for. Maybe they'll patch things up and get back together for good.\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\" I said.</p><p>\"So this is your last afternoon together,\" Jesse remarked. \"Fate has driven the young romantics apart.\"</p><p>\" Da-a-a-ad!\" Debbie moaned, punching him. \"Don't say things like that! It's embarrassing!\"</p><p>\"That's what fathers are for.\" Jesse grinned. \"It's our job to embarrass our daughters in front of boyfriends.\"</p><p>Debbie scowled at him, but I could see she was enjoying the attention.</p><p>The meal was delicious. Donna had put all her years of expertise to great use. The turkey and ham practically melted in my mouth. The roasted potatoes were crisp and the turnip was sweet as candy. Everything looked fantastic and tasted even better.</p><p>Jesse told a few jokes that had us all in stitches, and Donna did her party trick: balancing a roll on her nose. Debbie took a mouthful of water and gargled her way through \"Silent Night.\" Then it was my turn to do a little entertaining.</p><p>\"This meal is so good.\" I sighed. \"I could even eat the cutlery.\" While everybody laughed, I picked up a spoon, bit off the head, chewed it into tiny pieces, and swallowed.</p><p>Three pairs of eyes practically popped out of their sockets.</p><p>\"How did you do that?\" Debbie squealed.</p><p>\"You pick up more than dust when you're on the road,\" I said, winking at her.</p><p>\"It was a fake spoon!\" Jesse roared. \"He's putting us on.\"</p><p>\"Give me yours,\" I told him. He hesitated, tested his spoon to make sure it was real, then passed it over. It didn't take long to gulp it down, my tough vampire teeth making quick work of it.</p><p>\"That's incredible!\" Jesse gasped, clapping wildly. \"Let's try a ladle.\"</p><p>\"Hold it!\" Donna yelled as Jesse reached across the table. \"These are part of a set and hard to replace. You'll be letting him loose on my grandmother's good china next.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\" Jesse said. \"I never really liked those old plates.\"</p><p>\"Watch it,\" Donna warned, tweaking his nose, \"or I'll make you eat the plates.\"</p><p>Debbie was smiling, and she leaned over to squeeze my hand.</p><p>\"I feel thirsty after those spoons,\" I joked, rising to my feet. \"I think it's time for the wine now.\" I paused. \"Is it okay for Debbie and me to have some wine?\"</p><p>Donna hesitated, but Jesse smiled and said, \"Come on, Donna - it's Christmas!\"</p><p>\"Well... okay.\" Donna sighed. \"But just this once.\" She looked up at me. \"Do you want me to open the bottle?\" she asked, getting up.</p><p>\"On second thought, not at all,\" I said, gently pushing her back down. \"You've been serving all afternoon. It's time someone waited on you for a change.\"</p><p>\"Hear that?\" Donna beamed at the other two. \"I think I'll exchange Debbie for Darren. He'd be much more useful to have around.\"</p><p>\"That's it!\" Debbie snorted. \"No presents for you tomorrow!\"</p><p>I was smiling to myself as I grabbed the wine from the fridge and peeled back the tinfoil from the top. The corkscrew was in the sink. I rinsed it, then opened the bottle. I sniffed - I didn't know much about wine, but it certainly smelled nice - and found four clean glasses. I went through my pockets for a couple of seconds, then fiddled with three of the glasses. Next I poured the wine and returned to the table.</p><p>\"Hurray!\" Jesse shouted when he saw me coming.</p><p>\"What took you so long?\" Debbie asked. \"We were about to send a search party to look for you.\"</p><p>\"Took me a while to get the cork out,\" I said. \"I'm not used to it.\"</p><p>\"You should have just bitten the top off,\" Jesse joked.</p><p>\"I didn't think of that,\" I said seriously. \"I'll do it next time. Thanks for the advice.\"</p><p>Jesse stared at me uncertainly. \"You almost had me going!\" He laughed suddenly, shaking a finger. \"You almost had me going!\"</p><p>His repetition reminded me momentarily of Murlough, but I quickly put all thoughts of the vampaneze out of my mind and raised my glass.</p><p>\"A toast,\" I declared. \"To the Hemlocks. Their name might be poison, but their hospitality is first class. Cheers!\" I'd rehearsed the toast earlier, and it came out as well as I'd hoped. They groaned, then laughed and raised their glasses, clinking them against mine.</p><p>\"Cheers,\" Debbie said.</p><p>\"Cheers,\" Donna added.</p><p>\"Bottoms up!\" Jesse chuckled.</p><p>And we took a sip.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY</p><p>Late on Christmas Eve. Down in the tunnels.</p><p>We'd been searching for a couple of hours, but it felt longer. We were sweating and covered with dirt, our feet and pants soaked through with filthy water. We were moving as fast as we could, making a lot of noise in the process. My ribs hurt to begin with, but I was over the worst of it now and barely noticed the stabbing pain as I bent and crouched down and twisted.</p><p>\"Slow down!\" Mr. Crepsley hissed several times. \"He will hear us if you keep this up. We must be more careful.\"</p><p>\"To hell with being careful!\" I yelled back. \"This is our last chance to find him. We've got to cover as much ground as possible. I don't care how much noise we make.\"</p><p>\"But if Murlough hears us - \" Mr. Crepsley began.</p><p>\"We'll chop off his head and stuff it with garlic!\" I snarled, and moved ahead even faster, making still more noise.</p><p>Soon we reached a particularly large tunnel. The water level was higher in most of the tunnels than it had been the night before, because of the melting snow on the ground, but this one was dry. Maybe it was an emergency pipe, in case the others overflowed.</p><p>\"We will rest here,\" Mr. Crepsley said, collapsing. The search was harder for him than for me, since he was taller and had to bend more.</p><p>\"We don't have time for a rest,\" I snapped. \"Do you think Murlough is resting?\"</p><p>\"Darren, you must calm down,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"I understand your agitation, but we cannot help Evra by panicking. You are tired, as am I. A few minutes will make no difference, one way or the other.\"</p><p>\"You don't care, do you?\" I whined. \"Evra's down here somewhere, being tormented or cooked, and all you're worried about are your tired old legs.\"</p><p>\"They are old,\" Mr. Crepsley growled, \"and they are tired, and so, I am sure, are yours. Sit down and stop acting like a child. If we are destined to find Evra, we shall. If not...\"</p><p>I snarled hatefully at the vampire and stepped in front of him. \"Give me that flashlight,\" I said, trying to rip it out of his hands. I'd dropped mine earlier and broken it. \"I'll go on ahead by myself. You sit here and rest. I'll find Evra on my own.\"</p><p>\"Stop it,\" Mr. Crepsley said, pushing me away. \"You are behaving intolerably. Calm down and -?</p><p>I gave a ferocious tug and the flashlight flew out of Mr. Crepsley's hands. It also spun out of mine, and shattered to pieces against the tunnel wall. We were thrust into complete darkness.</p>","<p>\"You idiot!\" Mr. Crepsley roared. \"Now we will have to go back up and find a replacement. You have cost us time. I told you something like this would happen.\"</p><p>\"Shut up!\" I shouted, shoving the vampire in the chest. He fell down hard, and I backed away blindly.</p><p>\"Darren!\" Mr. Crepsley shouted. \"What are you doing?\"</p><p>\"Going to find Evra,\" I said.</p><p>\"You cannot! Not by yourself! Come back and help me up: I have twisted my ankle. We will return with stronger flashlights and work faster. You cannot search without a light.\"</p><p>\"I can hear,\" I replied. \"And I can feel. And I can shout. Evra!\" I yelled, to prove my point. \"Evra! Where are you? It's me!\"</p><p>\"Stop! Murlough will hear. Come back and keep quiet!\"</p><p>I heard the vampire scrambling to his feet. Taking a deep breath, I ran. I fled far into the tunnel, then slowed and found a small pipe leading out of the large one. I slipped into it and crawled. Mr. Crepsley's shouts grew dimmer and dimmer. Then I came to another pipe and scurried down it. Then another. And another. Within five minutes, I'd lost the vampire.</p><p>I was alone. In the dark. Underground.</p><p>I shivered, then reminded myself why I was there and what was at stake. I looked around for a larger tunnel, feeling my way with my fingers.</p><p>\"Evra,\" I called softly. I cleared my throat and this time yelled, \"Evra! It's me! Darren! Can you hear? I'm coming to find you. Yell if you can hear me. Evra. Evra? Evra!\"</p><p>Shouting and calling, I moved forward, hands outstretched, ears straining for any sound, eyes useless - a perfect target for all the demons of the dark.</p><p>I'm not sure how long I was down there. There was no way of telling time in the tunnels. I had no sense of direction, either. I might have been going in circles. I just moved forward, calling Evra's name, scraping my hands on the walls, feeling my feet and lower legs turn numb from the damp and cold.</p><p>Sometimes a draft of air tickled my nostrils, a reminder of the world above. I moved fast whenever I felt the air, afraid of losing my nerve if I stopped to breathe it in.</p><p>I was moving downward, getting deeper into the system of pipes and tunnels. I wondered how many people had been down here over the years. Not many. In some of the older pipes, I might be the first human (half-human) to pass in decades. If I'd had time, I would have stopped to scrawl my initials on the walls.</p><p>\"Evra! Can you hear me? Evra!\" I repeated.</p><p>There'd been no response so far. I wasn't really expecting one. If I did stumble upon Murlough's lair, it was a pretty sure thing he would have taped up Evra's mouth. The vampaneze wasn't the sort to overlook a minor detail like that.</p><p>\" Evra!\" I croaked, my voice beginning to crack from the strain. \"Are you there? Can you -?</p><p>All of a sudden, with no warning, a hand jammed hard into my back and sent me crashing to the floor. I gave a yell of pain and rolled over, gazing blindly into the pitch-black depths.</p><p>\"Who's there?\" I asked shakily. A dry chuckle answered me. \"Who is that?\" I gasped. \"Mr. Crepsley? Is that you? Did you follow me down? Is it -?</p><p>\"No,\" Murlough whispered in my ear. \"It's not.\" He flicked on a flashlight directly in front of my eyes.</p><p>The light was blinding. I gasped and shut my eyes, all thoughts of defending myself forgotten. It was what the vampaneze had been waiting for. Before I could react, he ducked forward, opened his mouth, and breathed on me... the breath of the undead... the gas that knocks people out.</p><p>I tried drawing back, but it was too late. The gas was in me. It raced up my nostrils and down my throat, flooding my lungs, forcing me to double over, coughing fitfully.</p><p>The last thing I remember was falling forward, Murlough's bare purple feet growing larger as I dropped toward them.</p><p>And then... nothing. Just black.</p><p>CHAPER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>When I came to, I found myself face to face with a skull. Not any old skull, either - this still had flesh on it, and one of the eyeballs was floating in its socket.</p><p>I screamed and tried pulling away, but I couldn't. Looking up (up? Why wasn't I looking down?) atmy body, I realized I was bound tightly with ropes. After a few seconds of puzzled panic, I noticed another rope around my ankles, and it dawned on me that I was hanging upside down.</p><p>\"I bet the world looks different from there, hmmm?\" Murlough said. Twisting around - I couldn't move my limbs, but I could swing around - I saw him sitting a little ways from the skull, chewing on a fingernail. He stuck out a foot and began rocking the skull. \"Say hello to Evra,\" he chuckled.</p><p>\" No!\" I screamed, swinging forward, baring my teeth, trying to bite deep into his leg. Unfortunately, the rope wouldn't stretch that far. \"You promised you wouldn't kill him before Christmas!\" I cried.</p><p>\"You mean it isn't Christmas?\" Murlough asked innocently. \"Whoops! Sorry. Bit of a boo-boo, hmmm?\"</p><p>\"I'll kill you,\" I swore. \"I'm going to -?</p><p>A groan stopped me short. Turning, I noticed I wasn't alone. Somebody else was strung upside down, a couple of feet away.</p><p>\"Who's that?\" I asked, certain it was Mr. Crepsley. \"Who's there?\"</p><p>\"D-D-D-Darren?\" a tiny voice said.</p><p>\" Evra?\" I gasped with disbelief.</p><p>Murlough laughed and flicked on a bright light. It took my eyes a few seconds to adjust to the light. When they did, I was able to make out the familiar shape and features of the snake-boy. He looked hungry, exhausted, and scared - but he was alive.</p><p>Evra was alive!</p><p>\"Fooled you, didn't I?\" Murlough giggled, shuffling closer.</p><p>\"What are you doing here, Darren?\" Evra moaned. His face was badly cut and bruised, and I could see a pinkish patch on his right arm and shoulder where scales had been brutally hacked off. \"How did he -?</p><p>\"That's enough out of you, reptile!\" Murlough growled. He kicked out at Evra, sending him snapping back on his rope.</p><p>\"Stop that!\" I roared.</p><p>\"Make me.\" Murlough laughed. \"Be quiet,\" he warned Evra. \"If you speak again without permission, they'll be your last words. Understand?\" Evra nodded feebly. All the fight had been hammered out of him. He was a pitiful sight. But at least he was alive. That was the main thing.</p><p>I began to take in my surroundings. We were in a large cavern. It was too dark to tell if it was natural or man-made. Evra and me were hanging from a steel bar. Skeletons littered the floor. I could hear water dripping somewhere, and I spotted a rough bed in one corner.</p><p>\"Why have you brought me here?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Snakey was lonely,\" Murlough answered. \"I thought you'd be good company for him, hmmm?\"</p><p>\"How did you find me?\"</p><p>\"Wasn't hard,\" Murlough said. \"Wasn't hard. Heard you and the vampire coming from miles away. Followed you. Murlough knows these pipes like the back of his teeth, yes he does. Young Murlough's smart. Been down here long enough. Wasn't just twiddling my thumbs.\"</p><p>\"Why didn't you attack?\" I asked. \"I thought you wanted to kill Mr. Crepsley.\"</p><p>\"I will,\" Murlough said. \"Biding my time. Waiting for the right moment. Then you stormed off and made things easy. Young Murlough couldn't pass up a gift. I'll get the vampire later. You'll do for now. You and Snakey.\"</p><p>\"Mr. Crepsley was alone,\" I baited him. \"He had no flashlight. He was in the dark. But you decided to come after me. You're a coward. You were too scared to attack someone your own size. You're no better than -?</p><p>Murlough's fist connected with my jaw, and I saw stars.</p><p>\"Say that again,\" he hissed, \"and I'll slice off an ear.\"</p><p>I stared at the vampaneze with hatred, but held my tongue.</p><p>\"Murlough's afraid of nothing!\" he told me. \"Especially not a weak old vampire like Crepsley. What kind of a vampire is it that consorts with children, hmmm? He isn't worth bothering with. I'll knock him off later. You have more guts. You're more hot-blooded.\" Murlough bent and tweaked my cheeks. \"I like hot blood,\" he said softly.</p><p>\"You can't drink from me,\" I said. \"I'm a half-vampire. I'm off-limits.\"</p><p>\"Maybe I'm finished with limits. I'm a free agent. I answer to no one. The laws of the vampaneze don't trouble me down here. I'll do what I like.\"</p><p>\"It's poison,\" I gasped. \"Vampire blood is poison to vampaneze.\"</p><p>\"Is it?\"</p><p>\"Yes. So's snake blood. You can't drink from either of us.\"</p><p>Murlough made a face. \"You're right about the snake blood,\" he grumbled. \"I took a little from him - just testing, you understand, just testing - and threw up for hours after.\"</p><p>\"I told you!\" I said triumphantly. \"We're no good to you. Our blood's worthless. It can't be drunk.\"</p><p>\"You're right,\" Murlough murmured, \"but it can be shed. I can kill and eat the two of you, even if I can't drink from you.\" He began pushing us, so that we were swinging around wildly. I felt sick.</p><p>Then Murlough went to get something. When he came back, he was carrying two huge knives. Evra began whimpering quietly when he saw the blades.</p><p>\"Ah! Snakey remembers what these are for.\" Murlough laughed evilly. He sliced the knives together, producing a sharp, grating sound that made me shiver. \"We had some fun with these, didn't we, reptile?\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry, Darren.\" Evra sobbed. \"He made me tell him where you were. I couldn't help it. He cut my scales off and... and...\"</p><p>\"It's all right,\" I said calmly. \"It's not your fault. I would have talked, too. Besides, that wasn't how he caught me. We left the hotel before he found it.\"</p><p>\"You must have left your brains behind, too,\" Murlough said. \"Did you really think you could waltz down here into my lair, rescue the snake-boy, and run along like a happy little lamb? Did it never occur to you that I am master of this domain, and would do all in my power to stop you?\"</p><p>\"It occurred to me,\" I said softly.</p><p>\"But you came anyway?\"</p><p>\"Evra's my friend,\" I said simply. \"I'd do anything to help him.\"</p><p>Murlough shook his head and snorted. \"That's the human in you. If you were a full vampire, you would have known better. I'm surprised Crepsley came so far with you before bailing out.\"</p><p>\"He didn't bail out!\" I shouted.</p><p>\"Yes he did, yes he did.\" Murlough laughed. \"I followed him to the top. That's why I didn't come after you sooner, hmmm? He ran as if the sun itself was at his back.\"</p><p>\"You're lying,\" I said. \"He wouldn't run. He wouldn't leave me.\"</p><p>\"No?\" The vampaneze grinned. \"You don't know him as well as you think, boy. He's gone. He's out of the game. He's probably halfway back to wherever it was he came from by now, fleeing with his tail between his legs.\"</p><p>Murlough leaped forward without warning and swung the two knives at my face, one from either side. I screamed and shut my eyes, expecting him to draw blood. But he stopped just a quarter of an inch short of my flesh, tapped my ears with them, then drew back.</p><p>\"Just testing,\" he said. \"Wanted to see how much moral fiber you have. Not much, hmmm? Not much. Snakey didn't scream until the fourth or fifth lunge. You're going to be less fun than I thought. Maybe I won't bother torturing you. Perhaps I'll kill you outright. Would you like that, half-vampire? It would be for the best: no pain, no suffering, no nightmares. Snakey has nightmares. Tell him about your nightmares, reptile. Tell him how you jerk awake, screaming and sobbing like a baby.\"</p><p>Evra pulled his lips in tight and said nothing.</p><p>\"Oh ho!\" Murlough smirked. \"Getting brave again in front of your friend, are you? Rediscovering your courage, hmmm? Well, don't worry - it won't take long to knock it back out of you.\"</p><p>He scraped the knives together again and circled around behind us, where we couldn't see him. \"Which one should I start with?\" he mused, jumping around behind us. \"I think... I'll choose...\" He went very quiet. I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing upright.</p><p>\" You!\" he suddenly roared, and threw himself on... me.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-TWO</p><p>Murlough pulled my head back. I felt the blade of a knife poking into the soft flesh of my throat. I stiffened in anticipation of the cut. I wanted to scream, but the blade stopped me. This is it, I thought. This is the end. What a lousy, useless way to die.</p><p>But the vampaneze was only teasing me. He slowly removed the knife and laughed nastily. He had all the time in the world. There was no reason for him to rush. He wanted to play with us awhile.</p><p>\"You shouldn't have come,\" Evra muttered. \"It was stupid.\" He paused. \"But thanks anyway,\" he added.</p><p>\"Would you have left me?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he said, but I knew he was lying.</p><p>\"Don't worry,\" I told him. \"We'll still figure a way out of this.\"</p><p>\" A way out?\" Murlough boomed. \"Don't talk rubbish. How are you going to escape? Chew through the ropes? You could if you could reach them with your teeth, but you can't. Snap them with your super vampire strength? No good. They're too strong. I tested them myself in advance, hmmm?</p><p>\"Face it, Darren Shan - you're doomed! Nobody's going to ride to the rescue. Nobody can find you down here. I'm going to take my time, cut you up into itty-bitty pieces, drop you all over the city - like confetti - and there isn't a thing you can do about it, so wise up!\"</p>","<p>\"At least let Evra go,\" I begged. \"You've got me. You don't need him. Think how horrible it'd be for him if you let him go: he'd have to live with the knowledge that I'd died in his place. That would be a horrible burden. It would be even worse than killing him.\"</p><p>\"Maybe.\" Murlough grunted. \"But I'm a simple man. I like simple pleasures. It's a nice idea, but I'd rather slice him up slowly and painfully, if it's all the same to you. Fewer complications.\"</p><p>\"Please.\" I sobbed. \"Let him go. I'll do anything you want. I... I... I'll give you Mr. Crepsley!\"</p><p>Murlough laughed. \"No go. You had the chance to do that earlier. You blew it. Besides, you couldn't lead me to him now. He's bound to have changed hotels again. Might even have fled the city.\"</p><p>\"There must be something I can give you!\" I yelled desperately. \"There must be some way I can...\" I stopped.</p><p>I could practically hear Murlough's ears stiffening.</p><p>\"What is it?\" he asked, after several seconds of silence. \"What were you going to say?\"</p><p>\"Wait a minute!\" I snapped. \"I have to think something through.\" I could feel Evra's eyes on me, half hopeful, half resigned to the fate he felt neither of us could escape.</p><p>\"Hurry up,\" Murlough prompted me, coming around in front of me. His purple face didn't show up well in the dim light of the cavern, so his eyes and lips appeared to be three free-floating globs of red, while his discolored hair looked like a strange kind of bat. \"I haven't got all night,\" he said. \"Speak while you're able.\"</p><p>\"I was just thinking,\" I said quickly. \"You're going to have to leave town after this, aren't you?\"</p><p>\" Leave?\" Murlough bellowed. \"Leave my beautiful tunnels? Never! I love it here. You know what being down here makes me feel like? As if I'm inside the body of the city. These tunnels are like veins. This cavern is the heart, where the blood of the city flows in and out.\" He smiled, and for once it wasn't an evil expression. \"Can you imagine?\" he said softly. \"Living in a body, roaming the veins - the tunnels of blood - freely, as you please.\"</p><p>\"Nevertheless,\" I said bluntly, \"you will have to leave.\"</p><p>\"What's all this talk of leaving?\" he snapped, jabbing me with the knife. \"You're beginning to annoy me.\"</p><p>\"I'm just being practical,\" I said. \"You can't stay here. Mr. Crepsley knows where you are. He'll return.\"</p><p>\"That coward? I doubt it. He'll be too -?</p><p>\"He'll return with help,\" I interrupted. \"With other vampires.\"</p><p>Murlough laughed. \"The Vampire Generals, do you mean?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said.</p><p>\"Nonsense! They can't come after me. There's an agreement between them and us. They don't interfere. Crepsley isn't a General, is he?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said. \"He's not.\"</p><p>\"There you are!\" Murlough yelled triumphantly. \"He couldn't have come after me if he was. Rules and laws and ways of living. They mean as much to the vampires as they do to the vampaneze.\"</p><p>\"All the same, the Generals will come,\" I insisted quietly. \"They couldn't before, but now they can. Maybe tonight. Tomorrow for sure. Maybe this is what Mr. Crepsley planned for all along.\"</p><p>\"What are you blabbering about?\" Murlough looked uneasy.</p><p>\"You said something interesting a while ago,\" I said. \"You were surprised Mr. Crepsley came down here with me. I didn't think anything of it at the time, but now that I've thought about it, I agree: it was weird of him. I thought it was because he wanted to help me find Evra, but now...\"</p><p>\" What?\" Murlough screeched when I didn't go on. \"Say what you're thinking. Out with it, or...\" He raised the knives threateningly.</p><p>\"The pact between the vampires and vampaneze,\" I said quickly. \"It says one side can't interfere with the other, right?\"</p><p>\"Right,\" Murlough agreed.</p><p>\" Unlessit's to defend or avenge themselves.\"</p><p>Murlough nodded. \"This is so.\"</p><p>I smiled weakly. \"Don't you see? I'm a half-vampire. If you kill me, the Generals will have an excuse to come after you. Mr. Crepsley must have planned this all along.\" I took a deep breath and looked Murlough straight in the eye. \"He let you find me. He wanted you to grab me. He meant for you to kill me.\"</p><p>Murlough's eyes widened. \"No,\" he wheezed. \"He wouldn't.\"</p><p>\"He's a vampire,\" I said. \"Of course he would. This is his city. I'm just his assistant. Which would you choose to sacrifice?\"</p><p>\"But... but...\" the vampaneze scratched his face nervously. \"I didn't make the first move!\" he shouted. \" You came after me.\"</p><p>I shook my head. \"Mr. Crepsley came after you. I'm innocent. I pose no threat. If you kill me, you'll be held accountable. The Generals will descend on you, and no vampaneze will step in to defend you.\"</p><p>Murlough let my words sink in, in silence, then he started jumping up and down on the spot, swearing furiously. I let him rage for a while, then I said, \"It's not too late. Let me go. Let Evra go, too. Run away from the city. They can't touch you then.\"</p><p>\"But I love these tunnels.\" Murlough groaned.</p><p>\"Do you love them enough to die for them?\" I asked.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \"You're very smart, aren't you?\" he snarled.</p><p>\"Not really,\" I said. \"I wouldn't have come down here if I was. But I am able to see the truth when it's staring me in the face. Kill me, Murlough, and you sign your own death warrant.\"</p><p>His shoulders sagged, and I knew I was safe. Now there was only Evra to worry about...</p><p>\"Snakey,\" Murlough said menacingly. \"He isn't a vampire. There's nothing to stop me killing him, hmmm?\"</p><p>\"No!\" I shouted. \"If you harm Evra, I'll go to the Generals myself and tell them -?</p><p>\"Tell them what?\" Murlough interrupted. \"Do you think they'd care? Do you think they'd risk war for the sake of a reptile?\" He laughed. \"Young Murlough's in a killing mood. I might not be able to have the little half-vampire, but I won't be cheated out of Snakey, too. Watch, Darren Shan. Watch as I carve the snake-boy a new mouth - in his stomach!\"</p><p>He grabbed the ropes around Evra and tugged him forward with his left hand. With his right, he positioned one of the knives and prepared to make the first cut.</p><p>\"Wait!\" I screamed. \"Don't do it! Don't do it!\"</p><p>\"Why shouldn't I?\" Murlough sneered.</p><p>\"I'll swap places!\" I yelled. \"Me for Evra.\"</p><p>\"No good,\" Murlough said. \"You're a half-vampire. No deal.\"</p><p>\"I'll give you somebody else! Somebody even better!\"</p><p>\"Who?\" Murlough laughed. \"Who could you give me, Darren Shan?\"</p><p>\"I'll give you...\" I gulped deeply, shut my eyes, and whispered the terrible words.</p><p>\"What was that?\" Murlough asked, pausing suspiciously. \"Speak up. I didn't hear you.\"</p><p>\"I said...\" I licked my lips and forced the words out again, louder this time. \"I said I'll give you my girlfriend. If you spare Evra, I'll give you... Debbie.\"</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-THREE</p><p>A stunned silence greeted my obscene offer. Evra was the first to break it.</p><p>\"No!\" he screamed. \"Don't do it! You can't!\"</p><p>\"Debbie for Evra,\" I said, ignoring Evra's pleas. \"How about it?\"</p><p>\"Debbie?\" Murlough scratched his cheeks slowly. It took him a few seconds to figure out who I was referring to. Then he remembered and smiled. \"Ah! Debbie! Darren Shan's tasty girlfriend.\" His eyes twinkled as he thought about her.</p><p>\"She'd be more use to you than Evra,\" I said. \"You could drink from her. You said you'd like to. You said she'd have nice blood.\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Murlough agreed. \"Salty. Juicy.\" He took a step back from Evra. \"But why choose?\" he mused aloud. \"Why not have both? Kill the snake-boy now, drink from Debbie later. She won't be hard to find. I can watch the square tomorrow, find out where she lives, and as soon as night comes...\" He grinned.</p><p>\"You don't have time,\" I said. \"You have to leave the city tonight. You can't wait.\"</p><p>\"Still yapping about leaving?\" Murlough snorted. \"If I let you go - as you've convinced me I should - I won't have to leave.\"</p><p>\"Yes you will,\" I contradicted him. \"It'll take a while for the vampires to discover I'm alive. The Generals will come straight down these tunnels when they arrive. They'll find out about me eventually, but if they kill you beforehand...\"</p><p>\"They wouldn't dare!\" Murlough shrieked. \"It would mean war!\"</p><p>\"But they wouldn't know that. They'd think they were in the right. They'd pay dearly for their mistake, but that would be no consolation as far as you're concerned. You have to leave, as soon as possible. You can return in a couple of weeks, but if you stick around now, it'll be a recipe for disaster.\"</p><p>\"Young Murlough doesn't want to leave.\" The vampaneze pouted. \"I like it here. I don't want to go. But you're right.\" He sighed. \"For a few nights at least, I must get out. Find a dark, abandoned cellar. Hole up. Lay low.\"</p><p>\"That's why Debbie would be better than Evra,\" I pressed on. \"You must be hungry. You'll want to feed before leaving, yes?\"</p><p>\"Oh, yes,\" Murlough agreed, rubbing his bloated stomach.</p><p>\"But feeding without planning is dangerous. Vampires are used to it, but vampaneze aren't, are they?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Murlough said. \"We're smarter than vampires. We think ahead. Plan it out. Mark our meals in advance.\"</p><p>\"But you can't do that now,\" I reminded him. \"You need a quick snack to keep you going while you're away. I can provide that. Agree to my terms and I'll take you to Debbie. I can get you in and out without anybody knowing.\"</p><p>\"Darren! Stop!\" Evra roared. \"I don't want this! You can't -?</p><p>Murlough punched Evra hard in the stomach, shutting him up.</p><p>\"How can I trust you?\" the vampaneze hissed. \"How do I know you won't trick me?\"</p><p>\"How could I?\" I retorted. \"Keep my hands bound behind my back. Keep a knife close to my throat. Leave Evra where he is - I'll come back for him later, once you've fed and left. If I try anything, I'll be dooming us both. I'm not stupid. I know what's at stake.\"</p><p>Murlough hummed tunelessly as he thought it over.</p><p>\"You can't do this.\" Evra moaned.</p><p>\"It's the only way,\" I said softly.</p><p>\"I don't want to trade Debbie's life for mine,\" he said. \"I'd rather die myself.\"</p><p>\"See if you think that way tomorrow.\" I grunted.</p><p>\"How can you do it?\" he asked. \"How can you give her up as if she was just a... a...\"</p><p>\"A human\" I said shortly.</p><p>\"I was going to say animal.\"</p><p>I smiled thinly. \"To a vampire it's the same thing. You're my best friend, Evra. Debbie's just a human I had a crush on.\"</p><p>Evra shook his head. \"I don't recognize you anymore,\" he said sadly, and turned away from me.</p><p>\"All right.\" Murlough reached a decision. He drew back his knives, then thrust them forward. I winced, but he only cut the rope around my ankles. I fell heavily to the floor. \"We'll do it your way,\" the vampaneze declared. \"But if you put one foot out of line...\"</p><p>\"I won't,\" I said, getting up. \"Now - how about your word?\"</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"You haven't given it to me yet. I'm not leaving without it.\"</p><p>The vampaneze grinned. \"Clever boy,\" he gurgled. \"All right. I give you my word - the girl for Snakey. Debbie for Evra. Is that good enough for you?\"</p><p>I shook my head. \"Say you'll let me go when you're finished with Debbie. Say you won't stop me coming back to free Evra. Say you'll do nothing to hurt either of us afterward.\"</p><p>Murlough laughed. \"Oh, you're clever all right. Almost as clever as young Murlough. Very well. I'll let you go. I'll do nothing to stop you coming back, or hurt you once you're free.\" He raised a finger. \"But if you ever return to this city, or if our paths cross in the future, it'll be death. This is a temporary deal, not a long-term guarantee. Agreed?\"</p><p>\"Agreed.\"</p><p>\"Very well. Should we start?\"</p><p>\"Aren't you going to undo a few of these ropes?\" I asked. \"I can barely walk like this.\"</p><p>\" Barelyis good enough.\" Murlough laughed. \"I'm not going to take any chances with you. I've got a feeling you wouldn't miss a trick.\" He shoved me hard in the back. I stumbled, then found my feet and began to walk.</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder at Evra. \"I won't be long,\" I said. \"I'll be back before dawn, and we'll both go home to the Cirque Du Freak, okay?\"</p><p>He didn't answer. He refused to even look at me.</p><p>Sighing, I turned around and started out of the lair, Murlough guiding me through the tunnels, singing gruesome little songs as he skipped along after me, telling me what he was going to do once he got his foul hands on Debbie.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>We passed quickly through the tunnels. Murlough marked the walls as he went, scratching them with his nails. He didn't want to, but I told him the deal was off if he didn't. This way, I would only have to follow the marks when I returned. A lot simpler than trying to remember every twist and turn.</p>","<p>Murlough had to carry me whenever crawling or climbing was required. I hated being so close to him - his breath stank of human blood - but I had to put up with it. He wasn't going to loosen the ropes around my arms, no matter what the circumstances.</p><p>We left the tunnels by a drain close to the square. Murlough hauled me up, only to shove me down violently when a car passed nearby.</p><p>\"Have to be careful,\" he hissed. \"Police have been over the city like flies since they found the bodies. Most annoying. In the future, I'll bury bones more carefully.\"</p><p>He brushed some dirt off his white suit when he stood, but made no effort to clean mine. \"Have to get new clothes when I come back,\" he said. \"Very awkward. Can never visit the same tailor twice, hmmm?\"</p><p>\"Why not?\" I asked.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at me. \"Is this a face you would forget in a hurry?\" he asked, pointing to his purplish skin and red features. \"Nobody would. That's why I have to kill any tailor once he's measured and fitted me. I'd steal clothes from stores if I could, but I am of uncommon build.\" He patted his gross stomach and giggled.</p><p>\"Come on,\" he said. \"You lead. Take the back route. Less chance of being seen.\"</p><p>The streets were pretty much deserted - it was late on Christmas Eve, and the melting snow meant walking was slippery business - and we met no one. We trudged through the slush, Murlough shoving me to the ground whenever a car drove by. I was getting sick of it - unable to break my fall with my hands, my face was taking the worst of the punishment - but he only laughed when I complained.</p><p>\"Toughen you up, hmmm?\" he said. \"Build muscles.\"</p><p>Eventually we reached Debbie's. Murlough paused at the darkened back door and glanced around nervously. The surrounding houses were in darkness, but still he hesitated. For a moment I thought he was going to back out of our deal.</p><p>\"Scared?\" I asked softly.</p><p>\"Young Murlough's scared of nothing!\" he snapped immediately.</p><p>\"Then what are you waiting for?\"</p><p>\"You seem very eager to lead me to your girlfriend,\" he said suspiciously.</p><p>I shrugged as best I could beneath the ropes. \"The longer I have to wait, the worse I'm going to feel,\" I said. \"I know what has to be done. I don't like it, and I'll feel awful afterward, but all I want right now is to have it over and done with, so I can take Evra and find someplace warm to lie down and relax. My feet are like blocks of ice.\"</p><p>\"Poor little half-vampire.\" Murlough giggled, then used one of his sharp vampaneze nails to cut a circle in the glass of the back-door window. Reaching in, he opened the door and shoved me through.</p><p>He listened quietly to the noises of the house.</p><p>\"How many people live here?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Three,\" I said. \"Debbie and her parents.\"</p><p>\"No brothers or sisters?\" I shook my head. \"No guests?\"</p><p>\"Just the three of them,\" I repeated.</p><p>\"I might nibble one of the parents when I'm finished with the girl,\" he muttered.</p><p>\"That wasn't part of the deal!\" I hissed.</p><p>\"So what? I never said I'd spare them. I doubt if I'll be hungry after, but maybe I'll come back another night, pick them off one by one. They'll think it's a family curse.\" He giggled.</p><p>\"You're disgusting.\" I growled.</p><p>\"You're only saying that because you like me.\" He chuckled. \"Go on,\" he said, focusing back on serious business. \"Up the stairs. The parents' bedroom first. I want to make sure they're asleep.\"</p><p>\"Of course they're asleep,\" I said. \"It's the middle of the night. You'd hear them if they were awake.\"</p><p>\"I don't want them walking in on me,\" he said.</p><p>\"Look,\" I sighed. \"If you want to check on Jesse and Donna, fine, I'll take you to them. But you're wasting time. Wouldn't it be better if we got in and out as quickly as possible?\"</p><p>The vampaneze thought it over. \"Very well,\" he said. \"But if they wake up unexpectedly, young Murlough will kill them, yes he will, and it'll be your fault.\"</p><p>\"Fair enough,\" I said, and started up the stairs.</p><p>It was a long, tense walk. Being bound by ropes, I wasn't able to move as quietly as usual. Every time a step creaked, I winced and paused. Murlough was tense, too: his hands were twitching and he drew in a sharp breath whenever I made a noise and stopped.</p><p>When I got to Debbie's door, I leaned my head against it and sighed sadly. \"This is it,\" I said.</p><p>\"Out of the way,\" Murlough snapped, and shoved me to one side. He stood there, sniffing, then smiled. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I can smell her blood. You can smell it, too, I bet, hmmm?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said.</p><p>He turned the handle and eased the door open. It was dark inside, but our eyes were used to the greater darkness of the tunnels, so they adjusted quickly.</p><p>Murlough glanced around the room, noting the closets and chests of drawers, the few posters and pieces of furniture, the bare Christmas tree near the window.</p><p>Debbie's outline could just be seen beneath the covers of her bed, moving around slightly, like a person does when she's having a bad dream. The smell of her blood was thick in the air.</p><p>Murlough moved forward, then remembered me. He tied me to the door handle, tugged at it hard to make sure the knot was secure, then jammed his face up to mine and sneered.</p><p>\"Have you ever seen death before, Darren Shan?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said.</p><p>\"It's wonderful, isn't it?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said bluntly. \"It's horrible.\"</p><p>The vampaneze sighed. \"You cannot see the beauty. Never mind. You are young. You will learn as you grow.\" He pinched my chin between a couple of purple fingers and a thumb. \"I want you to watch,\" he said. \"Watch as I rip her throat open. Watch as I suck her blood out. Watch as I steal her soul and make it mine.\"</p><p>I tried turning my eyes away, but he pinched harder and forced them back. \"If you don't watch,\" he said, \"I go straight to the parents' room after this and kill the two of them, too. Understand?\"</p><p>\"You're a monster,\" I said, gasping.</p><p>\" Understand?\" he repeated menacingly.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said, jerking my chin free. \"I'll watch.\"</p><p>\"Good boy.\" He chuckled. \"Clever boy. You never know - you might like it. This could be the making of you. Maybe you'll come with me when I leave. How about it, Darren Shan? Fancy abandoning that boring old vampire and becoming young Murlough's assistant, hmmm?\"</p><p>\"Just get on with it,\" I said, not bothering to hide my disgust.</p><p>Murlough crossed the room slowly, making no sound. He drew his two knives as he walked and twirled them around like a pair of batons. He began whistling, but softly, too softly for any but the most advanced ears to hear.</p><p>The slight movements continued beneath the covers.</p><p>I watched, stomach churning, as he closed in on his prey. Even if I hadn't been under orders to watch, I couldn't have torn my eyes away. It was a dreadful sight, but fascinating. Like watching a spider zoom in on a fly. Only this spider carried knives, ate humans, and had an entire city for a web.</p><p>He approached the bed from the side nearest the door, stopping half a foot away. Then he pulled something from one of his pockets. Straining my eyes, I realized it was a bag. Opening it, he took out some kind of saltlike substance and sprinkled it on the floor. I wanted to ask what it was for, but didn't dare speak. I guessed it was some ritual that vampaneze performed when they killed somebody at home. Mr. Crepsley had told me they were big on rituals.</p><p>Murlough walked around the bed, sprinkling the \"salt,\" muttering words I couldn't make sense of. When he was finished, he walked back to the foot of the bed, glanced over to make sure I was watching, and then, in one swift move - almost too quick for me to follow - leaped on the bed, landed with a foot on either side of the sleeping form, jerked back the covers, and lashed out with both knives, killer cuts that would slash open Debbie's throat and end her life in an instant.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>Murlough's knives swished through the air, through the space where Debbie's neck should have been, and through the soft fabric of the pillows and the mattress.</p><p>But not through Debbie.</p><p>Because she wasn't there.</p><p>Murlough stared down at the creature tied to the bed, its hooves and snout bound as tightly as I was.</p><p>\"It's... a...\" His jaws quivered. He couldn't bring himself to say the word.</p><p>\"It's a goat,\" I finished for him, smiling grimly.</p><p>Murlough turned slowly, his face a mask of confusion. \"But... but... but...\"</p><p>While he was spluttering, trying to figure out what was happening, the door of one of the closets opened and Mr. Crepsley sprung out.</p><p>The vampire looked even more sinister than the vampaneze, with his blood-red clothes and cape, his orange crop of hair and ugly scar.</p><p>Murlough froze when he saw Mr. Crepsley. His red eyes bulged out of his head and his purple skin lightened a couple of shades as blood rushed from his face.</p><p>From the movies I'd seen, I was expecting a long, exciting fight. I thought the two would trade insults first, then Mr. Crepsley would draw a knife or a sword and they'd lunge at and evade one another, battling their way around the room, nicking each other in the early stages, gradually working up to the more serious wounds.</p><p>But it wasn't like that. This was a fight between superfast predators of the night who were only interested in killing, not impressing action-hungry audiences. There were just four moves in the conflict, and it was over in the space of two blurred and furious seconds.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley made the first move. His right hand zipped out and sent a short knife flying through the air. It struck Murlough in the upper left of his chest, a few inches higher than its target - his heart. The vampaneze recoiled and drew in air to scream.</p><p>While Murlough's mouth was opening, Mr. Crepsley sprang forward. One huge leap was all it took, then he was at the side of the bed, in position to go hand-to-hand with the vampaneze.</p><p>That was the second move of the fight.</p><p>The third move was Murlough's - his only one. In a panic, he lashed out at Mr. Crepsley with his left-handed knife. The blade glittered through the air at a frightening speed and would have been the end of the vampire had it been on target. But it wasn't. It soared a good three inches above the vampire's head.</p><p>As Murlough's left arm followed through on the swing, it left a gap that Mr. Crepsley exploited. Using only his bare right hand, he delivered the killer blow. Keeping the hand flat, rough nails jutting out like five sharp blades, he drove it into Murlough's stomach.</p><p>And when I say into, I mean into!</p><p>Murlough gasped and went deathly still. The knife dropped from his hand and he gazed down. Mr. Crepsley's hand had disappeared into the flesh of the vampaneze's belly, all the way up to his forearm.</p><p>He left the hand there a second, then yanked back sharply, bringing guts and a torrent of dark blood with it.</p><p>Murlough groaned and collapsed to his knees, almost squashing the goat in the process, then toppled to the floor, where he rolled over onto his back and tried closing the hole in his stomach with spit he'd quickly licked onto the palms of his hands.</p><p>But the hole was too wide. The vampaneze's healing spit was useless. There was nothing he could do to seal the flesh or stop his precious blood from pumping out. He was finished.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley stepped back from the dying vampaneze, picked up one of the bedsheets, and wiped his hand on it. His face was expressionless. He appeared neither pleased nor saddened by what he had done.</p><p>After a couple of seconds, Murlough realized his situation was hopeless. Flopping over onto his belly, his eyes settled on me, and he began crawling toward me, gritting his teeth against the pain.</p><p>\"Mr. Crepsley?\" I said shakily.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley studied the crawling vampaneze, then shook his head. \"Do not worry. He can do you no harm.\" But, taking no chances, he walked over, freed me, and stood by my side, ready to strike again if needed.</p><p>It was a long, agonized crawl for the vampaneze. I almost felt sorry for him, but had only to think of Evra strung up and what he'd planned to do to Debbie to remind myself that he deserved everything he'd gotten.</p><p>He paused more than once, and I thought he was going to die midway, but he was determined to have his final say. He fought on, even though he must have known he was accelerating the moment of his death.</p><p>He collapsed on his face at my feet and breathed heavily into the carpet. Blood was gushing out of his mouth, and I knew the end was almost upon him. He raised a trembling finger and crooked it, beckoning me to lean down.</p><p>I glanced questioningly at Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>The vampire shrugged. \"He is harmless now. It is up to you.\"</p><p>I decided to see what the dying vampaneze had to say. I bent down and leaned close to his mouth. He had only seconds left.</p><p>His red eyes rolled directionlessly in their sockets. Then, with a huge effort, they fixed on me, and his lips split into one last leer. He raised his head as high as he could and whispered something that I couldn't hear.</p><p>\"I didn't catch that,\" I told him. \"You'll have to speak up.\" I jammed my ear closer to his mouth.</p><p>Murlough licked his lips, clearing some blood and making space for air. Then, with his final breath, he got out the words that seemed so important to him.</p><p>\"Cluh-cluh-clever buh-buh-buh-boy, hmmm?\" He gurgled, then smiled blankly and fell forward.</p><p>He was dead.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-SIX</p><p>We bundled murlough's body into a large black plastic bag. We'd drop him off later in the tunnels of blood he'd loved so much. As fitting a burial place as any for him.</p>","<p>We stuck the goat in a bag, too, but made a couple of air holes in it. We'd expected Murlough to kill the goat, which I'd stolen earlier from the children's section of the city zoo. Mr. Crepsley wanted to take it back to the Cirque Du Freak - it would make a nice snack for Evra's snake or the Little People - but I persuaded him to set it free.</p><p>Next we cleaned up the mess. Murlough had shed a lot of blood, all of which had to be mopped up. We didn't want the Hemlocks to find it and start asking questions. We worked quickly, but it took a couple of hours.</p><p>With the cleaning finished, we climbed up to the attic and brought down the sleeping bodies of Jessie, Donna, and Debbie and laid them in their respective beds.</p><p>The entire night had been planned. The wine I brought for dinner? I drugged it when I was in the kitchen. I added one of Mr. Crepsley's potions to the wine, a tasteless little concoction that knocked everybody out within ten minutes. They'd be asleep for several more hours yet, and wake with sore heads, but otherwise no ill effects.</p><p>I smiled as I wondered what they'd think when they woke in bed, fully dressed, with no memories of the previous night. It would be a mystery, one they'd never solve.</p><p>It hadn't been a perfect plan. Lots of things could have gone wrong. For starters, there was no guarantee that Murlough would find me when I had my ?fight? with Mr. Crepsley and stormed off on my own, and no guarantee that he wouldn't kill me instantly if he did.</p><p>He could have gagged me when he caught me, in which case I would have been unable to convince him that he ought to let me live. Or he might have disregarded my warning about the Vampire Generals - what I said was true, but the trouble was, Murlough was crazy. There was no telling how a crazy vampaneze would act. He might have laughed at the threat of the Generals and sliced me up anyway.</p><p>Convincing him to swap Evra for Debbie was always going to be the trickiest part. For it to work, I'd had to deliver a perfect performance. If I'd come straight out and made the offer, Murlough might have been suspicious and not walked into the trap. If he'd been in full control of his senses, I don't think he would have fallen for it, regardless of my performance, so on that score his insanity worked in our favor.</p><p>And, of course, there was the killing of him to account for. Murlough could have beaten Mr. Crepsley. If he had, all six of us would have died: Mr. Crepsley, me and Evra, Debbie, Donna, and Jesse.</p><p>It had been a dangerous gamble - and unfair to the Hemlocks, who knew nothing of their role in the deadly game - but sometimes you have to take chances. Was it wise to risk five lives for the sake of one? Probably not. But it was human. If I'd learned one thing from my encounter with the crazy vampaneze, it was that even the undead could be human. We had to be - without a touch of humanity, we'd be like Murlough, nothing more than bloodthirsty monsters of the night.</p><p>I tucked Debbie in under the fresh covers. There was a tiny scar near her left ankle, where Mr. Crepsley had drawn blood earlier. He'd needed the blood to smear on the goat, in order to mislead Murlough's sense of smell.</p><p>I looked up at the vampire. \"You did well tonight,\" I said quietly. \"Thanks.\"</p><p>He smiled. \"I did what had to be done. It was your plan. I should be the one offering the thanks, were it not for the fact that you got in the way when I first had him in my sights. In my eyes, that makes us even, so neither need thank the other.\"</p><p>\"What will happen when the vampaneze find out we killed him?\" I asked. \"Will they come after us?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley sighed. \"With luck, they will not find the body. If they do, I hope they will be unable to trace him to us.\"</p><p>\"But if they do?\" I pressed him for an answer.</p><p>\"Then they will hunt us to the ends of the Earth,\" he said. \"And they will kill us. We would not stand a chance. They would come in their dozens and the Generals would not assist us.\"</p><p>\"Oh,\" I said. \"I wish I hadn't asked.\"</p><p>\"Would you rather I'd lied?\"</p><p>I shook my head. \"No. No more lies.\" I smiled. \"But I think it'll be for the best if we don't tell Evra. What he doesn't know can't worry him. Besides, he's mad enough at me as it is. He thought I was really going to trade Debbie's life for his. He's furious.\"</p><p>\"He will calm down when the facts are explained,\" Mr. Crepsley said confidently. \"Now - shall we go and get him?\"</p><p>I hesitated and looked down at Debbie. \"Can I have a couple of minutes to myself?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Of course,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"But do not delay: dawn approaches and I do not wish to spend tomorrow trapped in those godforsaken tunnels. I will be downstairs.\" He departed.</p><p>I checked my watch. Nearly four in the morning. That meant this was the twenty-fifth of December. Christmas Day.</p><p>I worked quickly. I placed the bare Christmas tree to one side of Debbie's bed, opened the box of decorations, and covered the tree with glittering balls, tiny figures, streams of tinsel, and twinkling lights. When I finished, I turned Debbie so that she was facing toward the tree. It would be the first thing she'd see when she opened her eyes in the morning.</p><p>I felt bad about leaving without saying good-bye. This way, I hoped to make it up to her. When she woke and saw the tree, she'd know I hadn't slipped away thoughtlessly. She'd know I'd been thinking of her, and hopefully wouldn't hold my sudden disappearance against me.</p><p>I stood over her a few seconds, studying her face. This would almost certainly be the last time I'd ever see her. She looked so sweet, lying there asleep. I was tempted to find a camera and take a photo, but I didn't need to - this was one picture I'd always be able to remember in perfect detail. It would join those of my parents, my sister, Sam - cherished faces that would never fade in the mental galleries of my memory.</p><p>Leaning forward, I kissed her forehead and brushed a stray lock of hair out of her eyes. \"Merry Christmas, Debbie,\" I said quietly, then turned and left - and went to rescue Evra.</p>"]},{"title":"Vampire Mountain","pages":["<p>PROLOGUE</p><p>\"PACK YOUR BAGS,\" Mr. Crepsley said late one night, as he was heading for his coffin. \"We leave for Vampire Mountain tomorrow.\"</p><p>I was used to the vampire making declarations out of the blue - he didn't believe in consulting me when he was making up his mind - but this was shocking, even for him.</p><p>\"Vampire Mountain?\" I yelled, racing after him. \"Why are we going there?\"</p><p>\"To present you to the Council,\" he said. \"It is time.\"</p><p>\"The Council of Vampire Generals?\" I asked. \"Why do we have to go? Why now?\"</p><p>\"We go because it is proper,\" he said. \"And we go now because the Council only meets once every twelve years. If we miss this year's gathering, we will have a long wait until the next.\"</p><p>And that was all he'd say about it. He ignored the rest of my questions and tucked himself into his coffin before the sun rose, leaving me to worry the day away.</p><p>My name is Darren Shan. I'm a half-vampire. I used to be human until eight or so years ago, when my destiny clashed with Mr. Crepsley's and I reluctantly became his assistant. I had a hard time adapting to the vampire and his ways - especially when it came to drinking human blood - but finally I let go, accepted my situation, and got on with the business of living.</p><p>We were part of a traveling band of amazing circus performers, led by a man called Hibernius Tall. We toured the world, putting on incredible shows for customers who appreciated our strange and magical talents.</p><p>Six years had gone by since Mr. Crepsley and me had last been separated from the Cirque Du Freak. We left to put a stop to a mad vampaneze by the name of Murlough, who was terrorizing the vampire's home city. The vampaneze are a breakaway group of vampires who kill humans when they feed on them. Vampires don't - we just take a little bit of blood and move on, leaving those we suck from unharmed. Most of the vampire myths you read about in books or see in movies actually began with the vampaneze.</p><p>They were a pretty good six years. I became a regular performer at the Cirque, going on with Madam Octa - Mr. Crepsley's poisonous spider - every night to amaze and frighten audiences. I also learned a few magic tricks, which I worked into the act. I got along well with the rest of the Cirque troupe. I got used to the wandering lifestyle and had been having a good time.</p><p>Now, after six years of stability, we were about to journey into the unknown again. I knew a little bit about the Council and Vampire Mountain. Vampires were ruled by soldiers called Vampire Generals, who made sure their laws were enforced. They killed insane or evil vampires and kept the rest of the walking undead in line. Mr. Crepsley used to be a Vampire General, but quit a long time ago, for reasons he never revealed.</p><p>Every once in a while - I now knew it was twelve years - the Generals gathered at a secret fortress to discuss whatever it was that bloodsucking creatures of the night discussed when they got together. Not only Generals attended - I heard that ordinary vampires could go, too - but they made up the majority. I didn't know where the fortress was, or how we'd get there, or why I had to be presented to the Council - but I was about to find out!</p><p>Chapter ONE</p><p>I WAS EXCITED BUT ANXIOUS about the journey - I was venturing into the unknown, and I had a feeling it wouldn't turn out to be a smooth trip - so I spent the day busily packing knapsacks for myself and Mr. Crepsley, to make the time pass faster. (Full vampires will die if exposed to the sun for more than a few hours, but half-vampires aren't affected by it.) Since I didn't know where we were going, I didn't know what to take or leave. If Vampire Mountain was icy and wintry, I'd need thick clothes and boots; if it was somewhere hot and tropical, T-shirts and shorts would make more sense.</p><p>I asked some of the Cirque people about it but they didn't know anything, except Mr. Tall, who said I should pack for snow. Mr. Tall was one of those people who seemed to know something about everything.</p><p>Evra agreed about the snow. \"I doubt if sun-shy vampires would make their base in the Caribbean!\" He laughed sarcastically.</p><p>Evra Von was a snake-boy, with scales instead of skin. Or wait, he used to be a snake-boy - now he was a snake-man. Evra had grown these last six years, gotten taller and broader and older-looking. I hadn't. As a half-vampire, I aged at one-fifth the normal rate. So, although eight years had gone by since Mr. Crepsley blooded me, I only looked about a year older.</p><p>I hated not being able to grow normally. Evra and me used to be best buddies, but not anymore. We were still good friends and shared a tent, but he was a young man now, more interested in people - especially women! - his own age. In reality I was only a couple of years younger than Evra, but I looked like a kid, and it was hard for him to treat me like an equal.</p><p>There were benefits to being a half-vampire - I was stronger and faster than any human, and would live longer - but I would have given them all up if it meant looking my real age and being able to lead an ordinary life.</p><p>Even though Evra and me weren't as close as we'd once been, he was still my friend, and was worried about me heading off for Vampire Mountain. \"From what I know, that journey's no joke,\" he warned in the deep voice that had hit him a few years ago. \"Maybe I should come with you.\"</p><p>I would have loved to jump at his offer, but Evra had his own life to lead. It wouldn't be fair to drag him away from the Cirque Du Freak. \"No,\" I told him. \"Stay and keep my hammock warm. I'll be okay. Besides, snakes don't like the cold, do they?\"</p><p>\"That's true.\" He laughed. \"I'd probably fall asleep and hibernate till spring!\"</p><p>Even though Evra wouldn't be coming, he helped me pack. I didn't have much to take: spare clothes, a thick pair of boots, special cooking utensils that folded up neatly so they were easier to carry, my diary - that went everywhere with me - and other stuff. Evra told me to take a rope - he said it might come in handy, especially when it came to climbing.</p><p>\"But vampires are great climbers,\" I reminded him.</p><p>\"I know,\" he said, \"but do you really want to hang off the side of a mountain with only your fingertips for support?\"</p><p>\"Of course he does!\" someone boomed behind us before I could answer. \"Vampires thrive on danger.\"</p><p>Turning to see who it was, I found myself face-to-face with the sinister being known as Mr. Tiny, and my insides instantly froze with fright.</p><p>Mr. Tiny was a small, plump man, with white hair, thick glasses, and a pair of green boots. He fiddled around a lot with a heart-shaped watch. He looked like a nice old uncle but was really a cruel, dark-hearted man who'd cut your tongue out as soon as say hello to you. Nobody knew much about him, but everyone was afraid of him. His first name was Desmond, and if you shortened it to ?Des\" and put it together with his last name you got Mr. Destiny.</p><p>I hadn't seen Mr. Tiny since a little after joining the Cirque Du Freak, but I heard a lot of stories about him - how he ate children for breakfast and burned down towns to warm his feet. My heart palpitated when I saw him standing a few feet away, eyes twinkling, hands wrapped behind his back, eavesdropping on Evra and me.</p><p>\"Vampires are peculiar creatures,\" he said, stepping forward, as though he'd been part of the conversation all along. \"They love a challenge. I knew one once who walked himself to death in sunlight, merely because someone had sneered at him for only being able to come out at night.\"</p><p>He stuck out a hand and, scared as I was, I automatically shook it. Evra didn't - when Mr. Tiny extended his hand to the snake-man, he stood, quivering, shaking his head furiously. Mr. Tiny just smiled and took back his hand.</p><p>\"So, you're off to Vampire Mountain,\" he said, picking up my knapsack and peering inside without asking. \"Take matches, Master Shan. The way is long and the days are cold. The winds that gust around Vampire Mountain would cut even a tough-skinned young man like you to the bone.\"</p><p>\"Thanks for the advice,\" I said.</p><p>That was the confusing thing about Mr. Tiny. He was always polite and friendly, so even if you knew he was the type of guy who wouldn't blink in the face of great evil, you couldn't help liking him at least some of the time.</p><p>\"Are my Little People near?\" he asked. The Little People were short creatures who dressed in blue robes with hoods, never spoke, and ate anything that moved (including humans!). A couple of the mysterious beings almost always traveled with the Cirque Du Freak, and there were eight of them with us at that time.</p><p>\"They're probably in their tent,\" I said. \"I brought them some food about an hour ago, and I think they're still eating.\" One of my jobs was to hunt for the Little People's food. Evra used to do it with me, until he grew up and demanded less messy chores. Nowadays I was helped by a couple of young humans, children of the Cirque helpers.</p><p>\"Excellent.\" Mr. Tiny beamed, and began to walk away. \"Oh.\" He paused. \"One last thing. Tell Larten not to leave until I've had a word with him.\"</p><p>\"I think we're in a hurry,\" I said. \"We might not have time to -\"</p><p>\"Just tell him I want a word,\" Mr. Tiny interrupted. \"I'm sure he'll make time for me.\" With that, he tipped his glasses at us, waved good-bye, and moved on. I shared a worried look with Evra, found some matches and stuck them in my bag, then hurried off to wake Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>Chapter TWO</p><p>MR. CREPSLEY WAS GRUMPY when I woke him - he hated getting up before the sun went down - but stopped complaining when I told him why I disturbed his sleep. \"Mr. Tiny.\" He sighed, scratching the long scar that ran down the left side of his face. \"I wonder what he wants?\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" I answered, \"but he said not to leave until he had a word with you.\" I lowered my voice and whispered, \"We could sneak away without being seen if we hurried. Dusk isn't too far away. You could handle about an hour of sunlight if we stayed in the shadows, couldn't you?\"</p><p>\"I could,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed, \"were I given to fleeing like a dog with its tail between its legs. But I am not. I will face Desmond Tiny. Bring me my finest cloak - I like to look my best for visitors.\" That was as close to a joke as the vampire was probably going to come - he didn't have much of a sense of humor.</p><p>An hour later, with the sun setting, we made our way to Mr. Tall's caravan, where Mr. Tiny was entertaining the owner of the Cirque Du Freak with stories of what he'd seen in a recent earthquake.</p><p>\"Ah, Larten!\" Mr. Tiny boomed. \"Prompt as ever.\"</p><p>\"Desmond,\" Mr. Crepsley replied stiffly.</p><p>\"Have a seat,\" Mr. Tiny said.</p><p>\"Thank you, but I will stand.\" Nobody liked sitting when Mr. Tiny was around - in case they needed to make a quick getaway.</p><p>\"I hear you're taking off for Vampire Mountain,\" Mr. Tiny said.</p><p>\"We leave tonight,\" Mr. Crepsley confirmed.</p><p>\"This is the first Council you've been to in about fifty years, isn't it?\"</p><p>\"You are well informed,\" Mr. Crepsley grunted.</p><p>\"I keep an ear to the ground.\"</p><p>There was a knock at the door, and Mr. Tall let in two of the Little People. One walked with kind of a limp. He'd been with the Cirque Du Freak almost as long as me. I called him Lefty, although that was only a nickname - none of the Little People had real names.</p><p>\"Ready, boys?\" Mr. Tiny asked. The Little People nodded. \"Excellent!\" He smiled at Mr. Crepsley. \"The path to Vampire Mountain is as hazardous as ever, isn't it?\"</p><p>\"It is not easy,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed cagily.</p><p>\"Dangerous for a young snip of a thing like Master Shan, wouldn't you say?\"</p><p>\"Darren can look after himself,\" Mr. Crepsley said, and I grinned proudly.</p><p>\"I'm sure he can,\" Mr. Tiny responded, \"but it's unusual for someone so young to make the journey, isn't it?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Mr. Crepsley said curtly.</p><p>\"That's why I'm sending these two along as guards.\" Mr. Tiny waved a hand at the Little People.</p><p>\"Guards?\" Mr. Crepsley barked. \"We do not need any. I have made the trip many times. I can look after Darren myself.\"</p><p>\"You can indeed,\" Mr. Tiny cooed, \"but a little help never went astray, did it?\"</p><p>\"They would get in the way,\" Mr. Crepsley growled. \"I do not want them.\"</p><p>\"My Little People? Get in the way?\" Mr. Tiny sounded shocked. \"They exist only to serve. They'll be like shepherds, watching over the two of you while you sleep.\"</p><p>\"Nevertheless,\" Mr. Crepsley insisted, \"I do not want -\"</p><p>\"This is not an offer,\" Mr. Tiny interrupted. Although he spoke softly, the menace in his voice was unmistakable. \"They're going with you. End of story. They'll hunt for themselves and see to their own sleeping arrangements. All you have to do is make sure you don't 'lose' them in the snowy wastelands on the way.\"</p><p>\"And when we get there?\" Mr. Crepsley snapped. \"Do you expect me to take them inside? That is not permitted. The Princes will not stand for it.\"</p><p>\"Yes they will,\" Mr. Tiny disagreed. \"Don't forget by whose hands the Hall of Princes was built. Paris Skyle and the rest know which side their blood is buttered on. They won't object.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley was furious - practically shaking with rage - but the anger seeped out of him as he stared into Mr. Tiny's eyes and realized there was no arguing with the little man. In the end he nodded and shifted his gaze, ashamed at having to bow to the demands of this interfering man.</p><p>\"I knew you'd see it my way,\" Mr. Tiny said, then turned his attention to me. \"You've grown,\" he noted. \"Inside, where it matters. Your battles with the wolf-man and Murlough have toughened you.\"</p>","<p>\"How do you know about that?\" Mr. Crepsley gasped. It was common knowledge that I had a run-in with the maniacal wolf-man, but nobody was meant to know about our fight with Murlough. If the vampaneze ever found out, they'd hunt us to the ends of the Earth and kill us.</p><p>\"I know everything.\" Mr. Tiny cackled. \"This world holds no secrets from me. You've come a long way,\" he addressed me again, \"but there's a long way yet to go. The path ahead isn't easy, and I'm not just talking about the route to Vampire Mountain. You must be strong and keep faith in yourself. Never admit defeat, even when it seems inevitable.\"</p><p>I hadn't expected this kind of a speech, and I listened in a daze, numbly wondering why he was sharing these words with me.</p><p>\"That's all I have to say,\" he finished, standing and rubbing his heart-shaped watch. \"Time's ticking. We've all got places to be and deadlines to meet. I'll be on my way. Hibernius, Larten, Darren.\" He bowed briefly to each of us in turn. \"We'll meet again, I'm sure.\" He turned, headed for the door, exchanged a look with the Little People, then let himself out. In the silence that followed, we stared at one another speechlessly, wondering what all that had been about.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley wasn't happy, but he couldn't postpone leaving - making it to the Council on time was more important than anything else, he told me. So, while the Little People stood waiting outside his van, I helped him pack.</p><p>\"Those clothes will not do,\" he said, referring to my bright pirate costume, which still fit me after all the years of wear and tear. \"Where we are going, you would stand out like a peacock. Here,\" he threw a bundle at me. I unrolled it to reveal a light gray sweatshirt and pants, plus a woolly hat.</p><p>\"How long have you been preparing for this?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Some time now,\" he admitted, pulling on clothes with the same color as mine, in place of his usual red outfit.</p><p>\"Couldn't you have told me about it earlier?\"</p><p>\"I could have,\" he replied in that infuriating way of his.</p><p>I slipped into my new clothes, then looked for socks and shoes. Mr. Crepsley shook his head when he saw me searching. \"No footwear,\" he said. \"We go barefoot.\"</p><p>\"Over snow and ice?\" I yelped.</p><p>\"Vampires have harder feet than humans,\" he said. \"You will barely feel the cold, especially when we are walking.\"</p><p>\"What about stones and thorns?\" I grumbled.</p><p>\"They will toughen your soles up even more.\" He grinned, then took off his slippers. \"It is the same for all vampires. The way to Vampire Mountain is not just a journey - it is a test. Boots, jackets, ropes: Such items are not permitted.\"</p><p>\"Sounds crazy to me.\" I sighed, but took the rope, spare clothes, and boots out of my bag. When we were ready, Mr. Crepsley asked where Madam Octa was. \"You're not bringing her, are you?\" I grumbled - I knew who'd have to look after her if she came, and it wouldn't be Mr. Crepsley!</p><p>\"There is someone I wish to show her to,\" he said.</p><p>\"Someone who eats spiders, I hope,\" I said, but grabbed her from behind his coffin, where I kept her between shows. She shuffled around while I lifted the cage and placed it in my bag, but settled down once she found herself in the dark again.</p><p>Then it was time to go. I had said good-bye to Evra earlier - he was taking part in that night's show and had to prepare - and Mr. Crepsley had said good-bye to Mr. Tall. Nobody else would miss us.</p><p>\"Ready?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"Ready,\" I sighed.</p><p>Leaving the safety of the van, we cleared the camp, let the two silent Little People fall into place behind us, and set off on what would prove to be a wild, danger-filled adventure into lands cold and foreign and steeped in blood.</p><p>Chapter THREE</p><p>I WOKE UP A LITTLE before nightfall, stretched the stiffness out of my bones - what I would have given for a bed or hammock! - then left the inside of the cave to study the barren land we were journeying through. I didn't get much of a chance to study the countryside while we traveled at night. It was only during quiet moments like these that I could stop and take everything in.</p><p>We hadn't hit the snowlands yet, but already we had left most of civilization behind. Humans were few and far between out here where the ground was rocky and forbidding. Even animals were scarce, but some were strong enough to survive - mostly deer, wolves, and bears.</p><p>We'd been traveling for weeks, maybe a month - I lost track of time after the first couple of nights.</p><p>Whenever I asked Mr. Crepsley how many miles were left, he'd smile and say, \"We are some way off yet.\"</p><p>My feet got cut up badly when we reached the hard ground. Mr. Crepsley applied the sap of herbal plants that he found along the way on my soles and carried me for a couple of nights while my skin grew back (I healed quicker than a human would). I'd been okay since then.</p><p>I said one night that it was too bad that the Little People were with us, or he could have carried me on his back and flitted. (Vampires can run at an extra-fast speed, a magic kind of running, where they slip through space like eels through a net. They call it \"flitting.\") He said our slow pace had nothing to do with the Little People. \"Flitting is not permitted on the way to Vampire Mountain,\" he explained. \"The journey is a way of weeding out the weak from the strong. Vampires are ruthless in certain aspects. We do not believe in supporting those who are incapable of supporting themselves.\"</p><p>\"That's not very nice,\" I observed. \"What about somebody who's old or injured?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley shrugged. \"Either they do not attempt the journey, or they die trying.\"</p><p>\"That's stupid,\" I said. \"If I could flit, I would. No one would know.\"</p><p>The vampire sighed. \"You still do not understand our ways,\" he said. \"There is no nobility in pulling the wool over the eyes of one's comrades. We are proud beings, Darren, who live by exacting codes. From our point of view it is better to lose one's life than lose one's pride.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley spoke a lot about pride and nobility and being true to oneself. Vampires were a stern lot, he said, who lived as close to nature as they could. Their lives were rarely easy, and that was the way they liked it - \"Life is a challenge,\" he once told me, \"and only those who rise to the challenge truly know what it means to live.\"</p><p>I got used to the Little People, who trailed along behind us at night, silent, aloof, precise. They hunted for their own food during the day, while we slept. By the time we woke up, they'd eaten and grabbed a few hours' sleep and were ready to go. Their pace never changed. They marched behind us like robots, a few feet in the rear. I thought the one with the limp might struggle, but he hadn't yet shown any signs that he was feeling any strain.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley and me fed mostly on deer. Their blood was hot, salty, and good. We had bottles of human blood to keep us going - vampires need regular doses of human blood to keep healthy, and although they prefer to drink directly from the vein, they can bottle blood and store it - but we drank from them sparingly, saving them in case of an emergency.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley wouldn't let me light a fire in the open - it might attract attention - but it was allowed in way stations. Way stations were caves or underground caverns where bottles of human blood and coffins were stored. They were resting places, where vampires could hole up for a day or two. There weren't many of them - it took about a week to make it from one to the next - and some of them had been taken over or destroyed by animals since Mr. Crepsley had last been here.</p><p>\"How come they allow way stations but no shoes or ropes?\" I asked one day as we warmed our feet by a fire and dove into roast venison (we ate it raw most of the time).</p><p>\"The way stations were introduced after our war with the vampaneze seven hundred years ago,\" he said. \"We lost many of our clan in the fight with the vampaneze, and humans killed even more of us. Our numbers were dangerously low. The way stations were set up to make it easier to get to Vampire Mountain. Some vampires object to them and never use them, but most accept them.\"</p><p>\"How many vampires are there?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Between two and three thousand,\" he answered. \"Maybe a few hundred more or less.\"</p><p>I whistled. \"That's a lot!\"</p><p>\"Three thousand is nothing,\" he said. \"Think about the billions of humans.\"</p><p>\"It's more than I expected,\" I said.</p><p>\"Once, we numbered more than a hundred thousand,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"And this was long ago, when that was a huge amount.\"</p><p>\"What happened to them?\" I asked.</p><p>\"They were killed.\" He sighed. \"Humans with stakes; disease; fights - vampires love to fight. In the centuries before the vampaneze broke away and provided us with a real foe, we fought amongst ourselves, many dying in duels. We came close to extinction, but kept our heads above water, just about.\"</p><p>\"How many Vampire Generals are there?\" I asked curiously.</p><p>\"Between three and four hundred.\"</p><p>\"And vampaneze?\"</p><p>\"Maybe two hundred and fifty, or three hundred - I cannot say for sure.\"</p><p>As I was remembering this old conversation, Mr. Crepsley came out from the cave behind me and watched the sun sinking. It looked the same color as his cropped orange hair. The vampire was in great form - the nights were getting longer the closer to Vampire Mountain we got, so he could move around more than usual.</p><p>\"It is always nice to see it go down,\" Mr. Crepsley said, referring to the sun.</p><p>\"I thought it was going to snow earlier,\" I said.</p><p>\"There will be snow aplenty soon,\" he replied. \"We should reach the snowdrifts this week.\" He glanced down at my feet. \"Will you be able to survive the harsh cold?\"</p><p>\"I've made it this far, haven't I?\"</p><p>\"This has been the easy part.\" He smiled, then slapped me on the back when he saw my discouraged frown. \"Do not worry - you will be fine. But let me know if your feet get cut up again. There are rare bushes that grow along the trail, the sap of which can seal the pores of one's skin.\"</p><p>The Little People came out of the cave, hoods covering their faces. The one without a limp was carrying a dead fox.</p><p>\"Ready?\" Mr. Crepsley asked me.</p><p>I nodded and swung my knapsack onto my back. Looking ahead over the rocky terrain, I asked the usual question: \"Is it much farther?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley smiled, began walking, and said over his shoulder, \"We are some way off yet.\"</p><p>Muttering darkly, I glanced back at the pretty comfortable cave, then faced front and followed the vampire. The Little People fell in behind, and after a while I heard brittle snapping sounds as they chewed on the bones of the fox.</p><p>Four nights later we ran into heavy snow. For a couple of nights we traveled over country that was one long, unbroken blanket of freezing white where nothing lived, but after that trees, plants, and animals appeared again.</p><p>My feet felt like two blocks of ice as we trudged through the belt of snow, but I gritted my teeth and walked off the effects of the cold. The worst part was getting up at dusk, having slept with my feet tucked underneath me all day. There was always an hour or two after waking when my toes tingled and I thought they'd fall off. Then the blood would circulate and everything would be fine - until the next night.</p><p>Sleeping outside was really uncomfortable. The two of us would lie down together in our clothes - which we hadn't changed out of since reaching the snow - and pull rough blankets we had made from deer skins over our bodies. But even with our shared warmth it was freezing. Madam Octa had it easy - she slept safe and snug in her cage, only waking to feed every few days. I wished I could change places with her.</p><p>If the Little People felt the cold, they didn't give any indication. They didn't bother with blankets, they just lay down underneath a bush or against a rock when they wanted to sleep.</p><p>Almost three weeks after we had last stopped at a way station, we came to another. I couldn't wait to sit beside a fire and eat cooked meat again. I was even looking forward to sleeping in a coffin - anything was better than hard, cold earth! This way station was a cave set low in a cliff, above a forest ring and a large stream. Mr. Crepsley and me aimed directly for it - a bright moon in the clear night sky lit the way - while the Little People went off to hunt. The climb only took ten minutes. I pushed ahead of Mr. Crepsley as we approached the mouth of the cave, eager to get the fire started, only for him to lay a hand on my shoulder. \"Hold,\" he said softly.</p><p>\"What?\" I snapped. I was irritable after three weeks of sleeping rough.</p><p>\"I smell blood,\" he said.</p><p>Pausing, I sniffed the air, and after a few seconds I got the whiff, too, strong and sickly.</p><p>\"Stay close behind me,\" Mr. Crepsley whispered. \"Be prepared to run the instant I give the order.\" I nodded obediently, then trailed after him as he crept to the opening and slid inside.</p><p>The cave was dark, especially after the brightness of the moonlit night, and we entered slowly, giving our eyes time to adjust. It was a deep cave,turning off to the left and going back sixty or more feet. Three coffins had been placed on stands in the middle, but one was lying on the floor, its lid hanging off, and another had been smashed to pieces against the wall to our right.</p><p>The wall and floor around the shattered coffin were dark with blood. It wasn't fresh, but by its smell I knew it wasn't more than a couple of nights old. Having checked the rest of the cave - to make sure we were alone - Mr. Crepsley edged over to the blood and crouched to examine it, dipping a finger into the dried pool and then tasting it.</p><p>\"Well?\" I hissed, as he stood, rubbing his finger and thumb together.</p>","<p>\"It is the blood of a vampire,\" he said quietly.</p><p>My insides tightened - I had been hoping it was the blood of a wild animal. \"What do you think -\" I started to ask, when there was a sudden rushing sound behind me. A strong arm wrapped around my middle, a thick hand clutched my throat, and - as Mr. Crepsley shot forward to help - my attacker grunted triumphantly: \"Hah!\"</p><p>Chapter FOUR</p><p>AS I STIFFENED HELPLESSLY, my life in the hands of whoever had hold of me, Mr. Crepsley leaped with the fingers of his right hand outstretched like a blade. He sliced the hand over the top of my head. My assailant released me and ducked in the same movement, dropping heavily to the floor as Mr. Crepsley sailed by. As the vampire rolled to his feet and spun to strike a second blow, the man who had grabbed me roared, \"Stop, Larten! It's me - Gavner!\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley paused and I scrambled to me feet, coughing from the fright, but no longer afraid. Turning, I saw a burly man with a scarred, patchy face and dark rims around both his eyes. He was dressed in clothes like ours, with a hat pulled down over his ears. I recognized him immediately - Gavner Purl, a Vampire General. I had met him years ago, right before my run-in with Murlough.</p><p>\"You bloody fool, Gavner!\" Mr. Crepsley shouted. \"I would have killed you if I had connected! Why did you sneak up on us?\"</p><p>\"I wanted to surprise you,\" Gavner said. \"I've been following you most of the night, and this seemed like the perfect time to close in. I didn't expect to almost lose my head in the process,\" he grumbled.</p><p>\"You should have been paying more attention to your surroundings and less to Darren and me,\" Mr. Crepsley said, pointing toward the bloodstained wall and floor.</p><p>\"By the blood of the vampaneze!\" Gavner hissed.</p><p>\"Actually, it is the blood of a vampire,\" Mr. Crepsley corrected him dryly.</p><p>\"Any idea whose?\" Gavner asked, hurrying over to test the blood.</p><p>\"None,\" Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>Gavner prowled around the inside of the cave, studying the blood and broken coffin, searching for more clues. Finding none, he returned to where we were standing and scratched his chin thoughtfully. \"He was probably attacked by a wild animal,\" he mused aloud. \"A bear - maybe more than one - caught him during the day, while he was sleeping.\"</p><p>\"I am not so sure of that,\" Mr. Crepsley disagreed. \"A bear would have caused great damage to the cave and its contents, but only the coffins have been disturbed.\"</p><p>Gavner ran his eyes over the cave again, noting the tidy state of the rest of it, and nodded. \"What do you think happened?\" he asked.</p><p>\"A fight,\" Mr. Crepsley suggested. \"Between two vampires, or between the dead vampire and somebody else.\"</p><p>\"Who'd be out here in the middle of nowhere?\" I asked.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley and Gavner exchanged a troubled look. \"Vampire hunters, perhaps,\" Gavner muttered.</p><p>My breath caught in my throat - I'd gotten so used to the vampire way of life, I had pretty much forgotten that there were people in the world who thought we were monsters and made it their business to hunt us down and kill us.</p><p>\"Or maybe humans who chanced upon him by accident and panicked,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"It has been a long time since vampire hunters aggressively trailed us. This may have been a case of mere misfortune.\"</p><p>\"Either way,\" Gavner said, \"let's not hang around and wait for it to happen again. I was looking forward to resting, but now I think it's best we don't cage ourselves in.\"</p><p>\"Agreed,\" Mr. Crepsley replied, and after one last sweep of the cave, we retreated, our senses alert to even the slightest hint of an attack.</p><p>We made our base for the night in the middle of a ring of thick trees, and lit a rare fire - all of us felt chilled to the bone after our experience in the cave. While we were discussing the dead vampire and whether we should search the surrounding area for his body, the Little People returned, carrying a young deer they'd captured. They stared suspiciously at Gavner, who stared just as suspiciously back.</p><p>\"What are they doing with you?\" he hissed.</p><p>\"Mr. Tiny insisted I bring them,\" Mr. Crepsley said, then raised a quieting hand as Gavner swiveled to ask more questions. \"Later,\" he promised. \"Let us eat first and dwell upon the death of our comrade.\"</p><p>The trees sheltered us from the rising sun, so we sat up long after dawn, discussing the dead vampire. Since there wasn't anything we could do about him - the vampires decided against a search, on the grounds that it would slow us down - talk soon turned to other matters. Gavner asked about the Little People again, and Mr. Crepsley told him how Mr. Tiny had appeared and sent them with us. Then he asked Gavner why he'd been trailing us.</p><p>\"I knew you'd be presenting Darren to the Princes,\" Gavner said, \"so I located your mental pattern and traced you through it.\" (Vampires are able to bond mentally with each other.) \"I had to cut up from a hundred miles south, but I hate traveling alone - it's boring having no one to chat with.\"</p><p>As we talked, I noticed a couple of toes were missing from Gavner's left foot and asked about them. \"Frostbite,\" he answered cheerfully, wriggling the three remaining toes. \"I broke my leg coming here a couple of Councils back. Had to crawl for five nights to reach a way station. It was only by the luck of the vampires that I didn't lose more than a few toes.\"</p><p>The vampires talked a lot about the past, old friends and previous Councils. I thought they'd mention Murlough - Gavner had alerted Mr. Crepsley to the insane vampaneze's whereabouts - but they didn't, not even in passing.</p><p>\"How have you been?\" Gavner asked me.</p><p>\"Fine,\" I said.</p><p>\"Life with this sour buzzard hasn't got you down?\"</p><p>\"I've coped so far.\" I smiled.</p><p>\"Any intentions of topping up?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Excuse me?\"</p><p>He raised his fingers so I could see the ten scars on the tips, the usual sign of a vampire. \"Do you plan to become a full vampire?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said quickly, then looked sideways at Mr. Crepsley. \"I don't have any such plans, do I?\" I asked suspiciously.</p><p>\"No.\" Mr. Crepsley smiled. \"Not until you have come of human age. If we made a full vampire of you now, it would be sixty or seventy years before you were fully grown.\"</p><p>\"I bet it's horrible aging so slowly when you're a kid,\" Gavner noted.</p><p>\"It is,\" I sighed.</p><p>\"Things will improve with time,\" Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>\"Sure,\" I said sarcastically, \"when I'm all grown up - thirty years from now!\" I got up and shook my head, disgusted. I got down a lot when I thought about the decades I'd have to spend on the road to maturity.</p><p>\"Where are you going?\" Mr. Crepsley asked as I headed toward the trees.</p><p>\"To the stream,\" I said, \"to fill our canteens.\"</p><p>\"Maybe one of us should go with you,\" Gavner said.</p><p>\"Darren is not a child,\" Mr. Crepsley answered before I could. \"He will be fine.\"</p><p>I hid a grin - I liked the rare occasions when the vampire gave me a compliment - and continued down to the stream. The chilly water was fast-flowing and gurgled loudly as I filled the canteens, splashing around the rims and my fingers. If I had been human I might have gotten frostbite, but vampires are a lot sturdier.</p><p>As I was corking the second canteen, a little cloud of steamy breath drifted across from the other side of the stream. I glanced up, surprised that a wild animal had ventured this close, and found myself staring into the flaming eyes of a fierce, hungry-looking, sharp-fanged wolf.</p><p>Chapter FIVE</p><p>THE WOLF STUDIED ME SILENTLY, its nose crinkling over its jagged canines as it sniffed my scent. I gently laid my canteen down, not sure what to do. If I called for help, the wolf might panic and flee - then again, it might attack. If I stayed like I was, it might lose interest and slink away - or it might take it as a sign of weakness and move in for the kill.</p><p>I was desperately trying to decide when the wolf tensed its hind legs, lowered its head, and pounced, crossing the stream with one giant bound. It crashed into my chest, knocking me to the ground. I tried scrambling away but the wolf had perched on top of me and was too heavy to throw off. My hands searched frantically for a rock or stick, something to beat the animal with, but there was nothing to grab except snow.</p><p>The wolf was a terrifying sight up close, with its dark gray face and slanting yellow eyes, its black muzzle and bared white teeth, some two or three inches long. Its tongue lolled out the side of its mouth and it was panting slowly. Its breath stank of blood and raw animal flesh.</p><p>I didn't know anything about wolves - except that vampires couldn't drink from them - so I didn't know how to react: Attack its face or go for its body? Lie still and hope it went away, or shout and maybe scare it off? While my brain was spinning, the wolf lowered its head, extended its long wet tongue, and... licked me!</p><p>I was so stunned, I just lay there, staring up at the jaws of the fearsome animal. The wolf licked me again, then got off, faced the stream, went down on its paws, and lapped at the water. I lay where I was a few moments more, then pulled myself up and sat watching it drink, noting that it was a male.</p><p>When the wolf had drunk enough, he stood, lifted his head, and howled. From the trees on the opposite side of the stream, three more wolves emerged and crept down to the bank, where they drank. Two were females and one was a young cub, darker and smaller than the others.</p><p>The male watched the others drinking, then sat beside me. He snuggled up to me like a dog, and, before I knew what I was doing, I'd reached around and was tickling him behind his ear. The wolf whined happily and cocked his head so I could scratch behind the other ear.</p><p>One of the she-wolves finished drinking and jumped the stream. She sniffed my feet, then sat on the other side of me and offered her head to be scratched. The male growled at her jealousy but she took no notice.</p><p>It wasn't long before the other two joined the couple on my side of the stream. The female was shier than her friends and hovered a couple of feet away. The cub wasn't scared and crawled over my legs and belly, sniffing like a hound dog. He cocked a leg to mark my left thigh, but before he could, the male wolf snapped at him and sent him tumbling. He barked angrily, then slunk back and climbed over me again. This time he didn't try to mark his territory - thankfully!</p><p>I sat there for a long time playing with the cub and tickling the bigger pair of wolves. The male rolled over onto his back, so that I could rub his belly. His hair was lighter underneath, except for a long streak of black hair that ran partway up his middle. ?Streak\" seemed like a good name for a wolf, so that's what I called him.</p><p>I wanted to see if they knew any tricks, so I found a stick and threw it. \"Fetch, Streak, fetch!\" I shouted, but he didn't budge. I tried getting him to sit at attention. \"Sit, Streak!\" I ordered. He stared at me. \"Sit - like this.\" I squatted on my butt. Streak moved back a little, as though he thought I might be crazy. The cub was really playful and jumped on me. I laughed and stopped trying to teach them tricks.</p><p>After that I headed back to camp to tell the vampires about my new friends. The wolves followed, although only Streak walked by my side - the others trailed behind.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley and Gavner were asleep when I got back, tucked underneath thick deer blankets. Gavner was snoring loudly. With only their heads showing, they looked like the ugliest pair of babies in the world! I wished I had a camera that could photograph vampires, so that I could take their picture.</p><p>I was about to get underneath the blankets when I had an idea. The wolves had stopped at the trees. I coaxed them in. Streak came first and examined the base, making sure it was safe. When he was satisfied, he growled lightly and the other wolves entered, keeping away from the sleeping vampires.</p><p>I lay down on the far side of the fire and held a blanket up, inviting the wolves to lie down with me. They wouldn't go underneath the blanket - the cub tried, but its mother jerked it back by the scruff of its neck - but once I lay down and covered myself with it, they crept up and lay on top, even the shy she-wolf. They were heavy, and the scent of their hairy bodies was overbearing, but the warmth of the wolves was heavenly, and despite the fact that I was resting so close to the cave where a vampire had been killed recently, I slept in complete comfort.</p><p>I was awakened by angry growls. Jolting upright, I found the three adult wolves spread in a semicircle in front of my bed, the male in the middle. The cub was cowering behind me. Ahead stood the Little People. Their gray hands were flexing by their sides and they were moving in on the wolves.</p><p>\"Stop!\" I screamed, leaping to my feet. On the other side of the fire - which had died out while I was sleeping - Mr. Crepsley and Gavner snapped awake and rolled out from under their blankets. I jumped in front of Streak and snarled at the Little People. They stared at me from underneath their blue hoods. I stared at the large green eyes of the one closest me.</p><p>\"What's happening?\" Gavner shouted, blinking rapidly.</p><p>The nearest Little Person ignored Gavner, pointed at the wolves, then at his belly, and rubbed it. That was the sign that he was hungry. I shook my head. \"Not the wolves,\" I told him. \"They're my friends.\" He made the rubbing motion again. \"No!\" I shouted.</p><p>The Little Person began to advance, but the one behind him - Lefty - reached out and touched his arm. The Little Person locked gazes with Lefty, stood still for a second, then shuffled away to where he'd left the rats they had caught while hunting. Lefty lingered a second, his hidden green eyes on mine, before joining his brother (I always thought of them as brothers).</p><p>\"I see you have met some of our cousins,\" Mr. Crepsley said, stepping slowly over the remains of the fire, holding his hands palms-up so the wolves wouldn't be alarmed. They growled at him, but once they caught his scent they relaxed and sat, although they kept a wary eye on the munching Little People.</p>","<p>\"Cousins?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Wolves and vampires are related,\" he explained. \"Legends claim that once we were the same, just as man and ape were originally one. Some of us learned to walk on two legs and became vampires - the others remained wolves.\"</p><p>\"Is that true?\" I asked.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley shrugged. \"Where legends are concerned, who knows?\" He crouched in front of Streak and studied him silently. Streak sat up straight and ruffled his head to make his ears and mane erect. \"A fine specimen,\" Mr. Crepsley said, stroking the wolf's long snout. \"A born leader.\"</p><p>\"I call him Streak, because he's got a streak of black hair on his belly,\" I said.</p><p>\"Wolves have no need of names,\" the vampire informed me. \"They are not dogs.\"</p><p>\"Don't be a spoilsport,\" Gavner said, stepping up beside his friend. \"Let him give them names if he wants. It can't do any harm.\"</p><p>\"I suppose not,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed. He held out a hand to the she-wolves and they stepped forward to lick his palm, including the shy one. \"I always had a way with wolves,\" he said, unable to keep the pride out of his voice.</p><p>\"How come they're so friendly?\" I asked. \"I thought wolves shied away from people.\"</p><p>\"From humans,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Vampires are different. Our scent is similar to their own. They recognize us as kindred spirits. Not all wolves are friendly - these must have had dealings with our kind before - but none would ever attack a vampire, not unless they were starving.\"</p><p>\"Did you see any more of them?\" Gavner asked. I shook my head. \"Then they're probably journeying toward Vampire Mountain to join up with other packs.\"</p><p>\"Why would they be going to Vampire Mountain?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Wolves come whenever there's a Council,\" he explained. \"They know from experience that there will be plenty of scraps for them to feed on. The guardians of Vampire Mountain spend years stocking up for Councils. There's always food left over, which they dump outside for the creatures of the wild to dispose of.\"</p><p>\"It's a long way to go for a few scraps,\" I commented.</p><p>\"They go for more than food,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"They gather for company, to salute old friends, find new mates, and share memories.\"</p><p>\"Wolves can communicate?\" I asked.</p><p>\"They are able to transmit simple thoughts to one another. They do not actually talk - wolves have no words - but can share pictures and pass on maps of where they have been, letting others know where hunting is plentiful or scarce.\"</p><p>\"Speaking of which, we'd better make ourselves scarce,\" Gavner said. \"The sun's going down and it's time we got a move on. You chose a long, roundabout route to come by, Larten, and if we don't pick up the pace, we'll arrive late for the Council.\"</p><p>\"There are other paths?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Of course,\" he said. \"There are dozens of ways. That's why - except for the remains of the dead one - we haven't run into other vampires - each comes by a different route.\"</p><p>We rolled up our blankets and departed, Mr. Crepsley and Gavner keeping a close eye on the trail, scouring it for signs of whoever had killed the vampire in the cave. The wolves followed us through the trees and ran beside us for a couple of hours, keeping clear of the Little People, before vanishing ahead of us into the night.</p><p>\"Where are they going?\" I asked.</p><p>\"To hunt,\" Mr. Crepsley replied.</p><p>\"Will they come back?\"</p><p>\"It would not surprise me,\" he said, and, come dawn, as we were making camp, the four wolves reappeared like ghosts out of the snow and made their beds beside and on top of us. For the second day running, I slept soundly, disturbed only by the cold nose of the cub when he snuck in under the blanket during the middle of the day to cuddle up beside me.</p><p>Chapter SIX</p><p>WE PROCEEDED WITH CAUTION for the first few nights after finding the blood-spattered cave. But when we encountered no further signs of the vampire killer, we put our worries on hold and enjoyed the rough pleasures of the trail as best as we could.</p><p>Running with wolves was awesome. I learned a lot by watching them and asking Mr. Crepsley questions; he considered himself something of a wolf expert.</p><p>Wolves aren't fast, but they never get tired, sometimes roaming twenty or thirty miles a day. They usually pick on small animals when they go hunting, but sometimes they go after larger victims, working as a team. Their senses - sight, hearing, smell - are strong. Each pack has a leader, and they share food equally. They're great climbers and can survive any kind of conditions.</p><p>We hunted with them a lot. It was so cool to race alongside them on bright star-speckled nights, over the gleaming snow - chasing a deer or fox and sharing the hot, bloody kill. Time passed quicker with the wolves around, and the miles slipped by almost unnoticed.</p><p>One cold, clear night, we came to a thick briar patch that covered the floor of a valley sheltered between two towering mountains. The thorns were extra thick and sharp, capable of pricking the skin of even a full vampire. We paused at the mouth of the valley while Mr. Crepsley and Gavner decided how to go on.</p><p>\"We could climb the side of one of the mountains,\" Mr. Crepsley mused, \"but Darren is not as strong a climber as us - he could be damaged if he slipped.\"</p><p>\"How about going around?\" Gavner suggested.</p><p>\"It would take too long.\"</p><p>\"Could we dig a way under?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Again,\" Mr. Crepsley said, \"it would take too long. We will just have to pick our way through as carefully as we can.\"</p><p>He took off his sweatshirt, and so did Gavner.</p><p>\"What are you getting undressed for?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Our clothes would protect us a little,\" Gavner explained, \"but we'd come out the other end in tattered rags. Best to keep them intact.\"</p><p>When Gavner took off his pants, we saw he was wearing a pair of yellow boxer shorts with pink elephants sewn into them. Mr. Crepsley stared at the shorts incredulously. \"They were a present,\" Gavner mumbled, blushing furiously.</p><p>\"From a human female you were romantically involved with, I presume,\" Mr. Crepsley said, the corners of his normally stern mouth twitching upward, threatening to split into a rare unrestrained smile.</p><p>\"She was a beautiful woman.\" Gavner sighed, tracing the outline of one of the elephants. \"She just had very bad taste in underwear...\"</p><p>\"And in boyfriends,\" I added impishly. Mr. Crepsley burst into laughter at that and doubled over, tears streaming down his face. I'd never seen the vampire laugh so much - I would never have guessed he could! Even Gavner looked surprised.</p><p>It took Mr. Crepsley a long time to recover from his laughing fit. When he'd wiped the tears away and was back to his normal somber self, he apologized (like laughing was a crime). Then he rubbed some awful-smelling lotion into my skin, which sealed the pores, making it harder to cut. Without wasting any more time, we went ahead. The going was slow and painful. No matter how careful I was, every few feet I'd step on a thorn or scratch myself. I protected my face as best as I could, but by the time we were halfway into the valley, my cheeks were specked with shallow red rivulets.</p><p>The Little People hadn't taken off their blue robes, even though the cloth was being cut to ribbons. After a while, Mr. Crepsley told them to walk in front, so they endured the worst of the thorns while clearing a path for the rest of us. I almost felt sorry for the silent, uncomplaining pair.</p><p>The wolves had the easiest time. They were built for terrain like this, and swiftly slinked through the briars. But they weren't happy. They'd been acting strangely all night, creeping along beside us, low in spirits, sniffing the air suspiciously. We could sense their anxiety, but didn't know what was causing it.</p><p>I was watching my feet, stepping carefully over a row of glinting thorns, when I ran into Mr. Crepsley, who'd come to a sudden stop. \"What's up?\" I asked, peering over his shoulder.</p><p>\"Gavner!\" he snapped, ignoring my question.</p><p>Gavner shuffled past me, breathing heavily (we teased him about his heavy breathing a lot). I heard him utter a choked cry as he reached Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>\"What is it?\" I asked. \"Let me see.\" The vampires parted and I saw a tiny piece of cloth snagged on a briar bush. A few drops of dried blood had stained the tips of the thorns.</p><p>\"What's the big deal?\" I asked.</p><p>The vampires didn't answer immediately - they were gazing around worriedly, much in the same way that the wolves were.</p><p>\"Can you smell it?\" Gavner finally replied quietly.</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"The blood.\"</p><p>I sniffed the air. There was only the faintest of scents because the blood was dry. \"What about it?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Think back six years,\" Mr. Crepsley said. He picked the cloth off the briar - the wolves were growling loudly now - and thrust it under my nostrils. \"Breathe deeply. Ring any bells?\"</p><p>It didn't right away - my senses weren't as sharp as a full vampire's - but then I remembered that long-ago night in Debbie Hemlock's bedroom, and the smell of the insane Murlough's blood as he lay dying on the floor. My face turned white as I realized - it was the blood of a vampaneze!</p><p>Chapter SEVEN</p><p>HE MADE GOOD TIME through the rest of the briar patch, taking no notice of the cutting thorns. On the far side we stopped to get dressed, then hurried on without pause. There was a way station nearby that Mr. Crepsley was determined to reach before dawn. The journey would normally have taken several hours, but we made it in two. Once inside and secure, the vampires fell into a heated discussion. They'd never encountered evidence of vampaneze activity in this part of the world before - there was a treaty between the two clans, preventing such acts of trespass.</p><p>\"Maybe it's a mad wanderer,\" Gavner suggested.</p><p>\"Even the most insane vampaneze knows better than to come here,\" Mr. Crepsley disagreed.</p><p>\"What other explanation could there be?\" Gavner asked.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley considered the problem. \"He could be a spy.\"</p><p>\"You think the vampaneze would risk war?\" Gavner sounded doubtful. \"What could they learn that would justify such a gamble?\"</p><p>\"Maybe it's us they're after,\" I said quietly. I didn't want to interrupt but felt like I had to.</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" Gavner asked.</p><p>\"Maybe they found out about Murlough.\"</p><p>Gavner's face went pale and Mr. Crepsley's eyes narrowed. \"How could they have?\" he snapped.</p><p>\"Mr. Tiny knew,\" I reminded him.</p><p>\"Mr. Tiny knows about Murlough?\" Gavner hissed.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley nodded slowly. \"But even if he told the vampaneze, how would they know we were coming this way? We could have chosen any number of paths. They could not have predicted our route.\"</p><p>\"Maybe they're covering all the paths,\" Gavner said.</p><p>\"No,\" Mr. Crepsley said confidently. \"It is too farfetched. Whatever the vampaneze's reason for being here, I am sure it has nothing to do with us.\"</p><p>\"I hope you're right,\" Gavner grumbled, unconvinced.</p><p>We discussed it some more, including the question of whether the vampaneze had killed the vampire in the previous way station, then grabbed a few hours of sleep, taking turns to remain on watch. I barely slept because I was worrying about being attacked by the purple-faced killers.</p><p>When night came, Mr. Crepsley said we shouldn't go any farther until we were sure the way was safe. \"We cannot risk running into a pack of vampaneze,\" he said. \"We will scout the area, make sure we are not in danger, then carry on as before.\"</p><p>\"Do we have time to go scouting?\" Gavner asked.</p><p>\"We must make time,\" Mr. Crepsley insisted. \"Better to waste a few nights than run into a trap.\"</p><p>I stayed in the cave while they went scouting. I didn't want to - I kept thinking about what had happened to that other vampire - but they said I'd be in the way if I came - a vampaneze would hear me coming a hundred yards away.</p><p>The Little People, she-wolves, and cub stayed with me. Streak went with the vampires - the wolves sensed the vampaneze presence before we did, so it would be helpful to have one along.</p><p>It was lonely without the vampires and Streak. The Little People were aloof like always - they spent a lot of the day sewing their blue robes back into shape - and the she-wolves lay out and snoozed. Only the cub provided me with company. We spent hours playing together, in the cave and among the trees of a nearby small forest. I called the cub Rudi, after Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, because he liked to rub his cold nose into my back while I was asleep.</p><p>I caught a couple of squirrels in the forest and cooked them, so they were ready in the morning when the vampires returned. I served hot berries and roots with them - Mr. Crepsley had taught me which wild foods were safe to eat. Gavner thanked me for the food, but Mr. Crepsley was distant and didn't say much. They'd discovered no further trace of the vampaneze, and that worried them - a mad vampaneze couldn't have covered his tracks so expertly. That meant we were dealing with one - or more - in full control of his senses.</p><p>Gavner wanted to flit ahead to consult with the other vampires, but Mr. Crepsley wouldn't let him - the laws against flitting on the way to Vampire Mountain were more important than our safety, he insisted.</p><p>It was strange how Gavner went along with most of what Mr. Crepsley said. As a General, he could have ordered us to do whatever he pleased. But I'd never seen him pull rank on Mr. Crepsley. Maybe it was because Mr. Crepsley had once been a General of high ranking. He'd been on the verge of becoming a Vampire Prince when he quit. Maybe Gavner still considered Mr. Crepsley his superior.</p>","<p>After a full day's sleep, the vampires set off to scout the land ahead again. If the way was clear, we'd start back on the trail to Vampire Mountain the next night.</p><p>I ate a small breakfast, then Rudi and me headed down to the forest to play. Rudi loved being away from the adult wolves. He was able to explore freely, with no one to snap at him or cuff him around the head if he misbehaved. He tried climbing trees but was too short for most. Finally he found one with low-hanging branches and he clambered halfway up. Once there, he looked down and whimpered.</p><p>\"Come on,\" I laughed. \"You're not that high up. You don't need to be afraid.\" He ignored me and went on whimpering. Then he bared his fangs and growled.</p><p>I stepped closer, puzzled by his behavior. \"What's wrong?\" I asked. \"Are you stuck? Do you want help?\" The cub yapped. He sounded genuinely frightened. \"Okay, Rudi,\" I said, \"I'm coming up to -\"</p><p>I was silenced by a bone-shattering roar. Turning, I saw a huge, dark bear lurching over the top of a snowdrift. It landed heavily, shook its snout, snarled, fixed its gaze on me - then lunged, teeth flashing, claws exposed, hell-bent on tearing me apart!</p><p>Chapter EIGHT</p><p>THE BEAR WOULD HAVE KILLED me, if it wasn't for Rudi. The cub leaped from the tree, landing on top of the bear's head, momentarily blinding it. The bear roared and swiped at the cub, who ducked and bit one of its ears. The bear roared again and shook its head viciously from side to side. Rudi held on for a couple of seconds, before he was sent flying into a thicket.</p><p>The bear resumed its attack on me, but in the time the cub had bought, I'd ducked around the tree and was racing for the cave as fast as I could. The bear lurched after me, realized I was too far ahead, bellowed angrily, turned, and went looking for Rudi.</p><p>I stopped when I heard frightened yapping. Looking over my shoulder, I saw that the cub had made it back up the tree, the bark of which the bear was now ripping to pieces with its claws. Rudi wasn't in any immediate danger, but sooner or later he'd slip or the bear would shake him down, and that would be the end of him.</p><p>I paused no more than a second, then turned, picked up a rock and the thickest stick I could find, and sped back to try and save Rudi.</p><p>The bear let go of the tree when it saw me coming, dropped to its hind legs, and met my challenge. It was a huge beast, maybe a yard and a half high; it had black fur, a white quarter-moon mark across its chest, and a whitish face. Foam flecked its jaws and its eyes were wild, like it was touched by rabid madness.</p><p>I stopped in front of the bear and whacked the ground with my stick. \"Come on, grizzly,\" I growled. It snarled and tossed its head. I looked up at Rudi, hoping he'd have enough sense to slink down the tree and retreat to the cave, but he stayed where he was, petrified, unable to let go.</p><p>The bear swiped at me, but I ducked out of the way of its massive paw. Rearing up on its hind legs, it collapsed flat on me, trying to crush me with the weight of its body. I avoided it again, but it was a closer call this time.</p><p>I was prodding at the bear's face with the end of the stick, aiming for its eyes, when the she-wolves rushed onto the scene - they must have heard Rudi's yapping. The bear howled as one of the wolves leaped and bit deep into its shoulder, while the other attached herself to its legs, tearing at them with her teeth and claws. It shook off the uppermost wolf and bent to deal with the lower one, which was when I darted in with my stick and jabbed at its left ear.</p><p>I must have hurt it, because it lost interest in the wolves and hurled itself at me. I ducked out of the way of its body, but one of its burly forelegs connected with the side of my head and knocked me to the ground.</p><p>The bear rolled to its feet and went for me, scattering the wolves with swipes of its claws. I scrambled backward, but not fast enough. Suddenly the bear was above me, standing erect, bellowing triumphantly - it had me exactly where it wanted! I slammed the stick against its stomach, then the rock, but it didn't take any notice of such feeble blows. Leering, it started to fall...</p><p>Which was when the Little People barreled into its back and knocked it off balance. Their timing couldn't have been any sweeter.</p><p>The bear must have thought the entire world was conspiring against it. Every time it had me in its sights, something new got in the way. Roaring loudly at the Little People, it threw itself at them madly. The one with the limp stepped out of its way, but the other got trapped beneath it.</p><p>The Little Person raised his short arms, jammed them against the bear's torso, and tried to shove it aside. The Little Person was strong, but he stood no chance against such a massive enemy, and the bear came crashing down and flattened him. There was a horrible crunching sound, and when the bear got to its feet, I saw the Little Person lying in pieces, broken bones jutting out of his body at crooked red angles.</p><p>The bear lifted its head and bellowed at the sky, then fixed its eyes on me and leered hungrily. Dropping to all fours, it advanced. The wolves leaped at it but it shook them loose as though they were fleas. I was still dazed from the blow, not able to get to my feet. I began crawling through the snow.</p><p>As the bear closed in for the kill, the second Little Person - the one I called Lefty - stepped in front of it, caught it by its ears, and head-butted it! It was the craziest thing I'd ever seen, but it did an amazingly effective job. The bear grunted and blinked dumbly. Lefty head-butted it again and was rearing his head back for a third blow when the bear struck at him with its right paw, like a boxer.</p><p>It hit Lefty in the chest and knocked him down. His hood had fallen off during the struggle and I could see his gray, stitched-together face and round, green eyes. There was a mask over his mouth, like the kind doctors wear during surgery. He stared up at the bear, unafraid, waiting for the killer blow.</p><p>\"No!\" I screamed. Stumbling to my knees, I threw a punch at the bear. It snarled at me. I punched it again, then grabbed a handful of snow and threw it into the beast's eyes.</p><p>While the bear cleared its vision, I looked for a weapon. I was desperate - anything was better than my bare hands. At first I saw nothing I could use, but then my eyes fell on the bones sticking out of the dead Little Person's body. Acting on instinct, I rolled across to where the Little Person lay, took hold of one of the longer bones, and pulled. It was covered in blood and my fingers slipped off. Trying again, I got a firmer hold and worked it from side to side. After a few tugs it snapped near the base and suddenly I wasn't defenseless anymore.</p><p>The bear had regained its sight and was pounding toward me. Lefty was still on the ground. The wolves were barking furiously, unable to do anything to stop the charging bear. The cub yapped from its perch in the tree.</p><p>I was on my own. Me against the bear. No one could help me now.</p><p>Spinning, using all my extra-sharp vampire abilities, I rolled underneath the clutching claws of the bear, jumped to my feet, picked my spot, and rammed the tip of the bone deep into the bear's unprotected neck.</p><p>The bear came to a halt. Its eyes bulged. Its forelegs dropped by its sides. For a moment it stood, gasping painfully, the bone sticking out of its neck. Then it crashed to the ground, shook horribly for a few seconds - and died.</p><p>I fell on top of the dead bear and lay there. I was shaking and crying, more from fright than pain. I'd looked death in the eye before, but never had I been involved in a fight as savage as this.</p><p>Eventually, one of the she-wolves - the normally shy one - cuddled up to me and licked around my face, making sure I was all right. I patted her to show I was okay, and buried my face in her neck, drying my tears on her hair. When I felt steady, I stood and gazed at the area around me.</p><p>The other she-wolf was by the tree, coaxing Rudi down - the cub was even more shaken than me. The dead Little Person lay not far away, his blood seeping into the snow, turning it crimson. Lefty was sitting up, checking himself for injuries.</p><p>I made my way over to Lefty to thank him for saving my life. He was incredibly ugly without his hood: He had gray skin, and his face was a mass of scars and stitches. He had no ears or nose that I could see, and his round, green eyes were set near the top of his head, not in the middle of his face like they are with most people. He was completely hairless.</p><p>Any other time I might have been frightened, but this creature had risked his life to save mine, and all I felt was gratitude. \"Are you okay, Lefty?\" I asked. He looked up and nodded. \"That was a close call.\" I half-laughed. Again he nodded. \"Thanks for coming to my rescue. I would have been a goner if you hadn't stepped in.\" I sank to the ground beside him and gazed at the bear, then at the dead Little Person. \"Sorry about your partner, Lefty,\" I said softly. \"Should we bury him?\"</p><p>The Little Person shook his large head, started to rise, then paused. He stared into my eyes, and I stared back questioningly. By the expression on his face, I almost expected him to speak.</p><p>Reaching up, Lefty gently tugged down the mask that covered the lower half of his face. He had a wide mouth full of sharp, yellow teeth. He stuck out his tongue - which was a weird gray color, like his skin - and licked his lips. When they were wet, he flexed and stretched them a few times, then did the one thing I was sure the Little People could never do. In a creaky, slow, mechanical tone - he spoke.</p><p>\"Name... not Lefty. Name... Harkat... Harkat Mulds.\" And his lips spread into a jagged gash, which was as close to a smile as he could come.</p><p>Chapter NINE</p><p>MR. CREPSLEY, GAVNER, AND STREAK had been checking a maze of cliff-top tunnels when they heard faint echoes of the fight. They raced back, arriving fifteen minutes or so after I'd killed the bear. They were stunned when I explained what happened and told them about Harkat Mulds. The Little Person had replaced his robes and hood, and when they asked him if it was true that he could talk, there was a long moment of silence during which I thought he wasn't going to say anything. Then he nodded and croaked, \"Yes.\" Gavner actually jumped back a few steps when he heard the Little Person speak. Mr. Crepsley shook his head, amazed. \"We will discuss this later,\" he said. \"First there is the bear to deal with.\" He crouched beside the dead bear and studied it from top to bottom. \"Describe how it attacked you,\" he said, and I told him about the bear's sudden appearance and savage attack. \"It makes no sense.\" Mr. Crepsley frowned. \"Bears do not behave in such a fashion unless agitated or starving. It was not hunger that motivated it - look at its round stomach - and if you did nothing to upset it...\"</p><p>\"It was foaming at the mouth,\" I said. \"I think it had rabies.\"</p><p>\"We shall soon see.\" The vampire used his sharp nails to cut open the bear's belly. He stuck his nose close to the cut and sniffed the blood that was oozing out. After a few seconds he made a face and stood up.</p><p>\"Well?\" Gavner asked.</p><p>\"The bear was insane,\" Mr. Crepsley said, \"but not with rabies - it had consumed the blood of a vampaneze!\"</p><p>\"How?\" I gasped.</p><p>\"I am not sure,\" Mr. Crepsley replied, then looked up at the sky. \"We have time before dawn. We will trace this bear's trail and perhaps learn more along the way.\"</p><p>\"What about the dead Little Person?\" Gavner asked. \"Should we bury him?\"</p><p>\"Do you want to bury him... Harkat?\" Mr. Crepsley asked, echoing my earlier question.</p><p>Harkat Mulds shook his head. \"Not really.\"</p><p>\"Then leave him,\" the vampire snapped. \"Scavengers and birds will pick his bones clean. We do not have time to waste.\"</p><p>The path of the bear was easy to follow - even an untrained tracker like me could have traced it by the deep footprints and broken twigs.</p><p>Night was coming to a close as we pulled up at a small mound of stones and found what had driven the bear mad. Half-buried underneath the stones was a purple body with a red head of hair - a vampaneze!</p><p>\"By the way his skull is crushed, he must have died in a fall,\" Mr. Crepsley said, examining the dead man. \"The bear found him after he was buried and dug him up. See the chunks that have been bitten out of him?\" He pointed to the gaping holes in the vampaneze's belly. \"That is what drove it mad - the blood of vampaneze and vampires is poisonous. Had you not killed it, it would have died in another night or two anyway.\"</p><p>\"So that's where our mystery vampaneze was,\" Gavner grunted. \"No wonder we couldn't find him.\"</p><p>\"We don't have to worry about him anymore, do we?\" I sighed.</p><p>\"Quite the contrary,\" Mr. Crepsley snapped. \"We have more reason to worry now than before.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" I asked. \"He's dead, isn't he?\"</p><p>\"He is,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed, then pointed to the stones which had been laid over the vampaneze. \"But who buried him?\"</p><p>We made camp at the base of a cliff, using branches and leaves to make a shelter where the vampires could sleep, safe from the sun. Once they were inside, Harkat and me sat by the entrance and the Little Person told his incredible story. The wolves had gone off hunting, except for Rudi, who curled up in my lap and dozed.</p><p>\"My memories... are not... complete,\" said Harkat. Speaking wasn't easy for him and he had to pause for breath a lot. \"Much is... clouded. I will tell... you what... I remember. First - I am a... ghost.\"</p><p>Our jaws dropped.</p><p>\"A ghost!\" Mr. Crepsley shouted. \"Absurd!\"</p><p>\"Absolutely,\" Gavner agreed with a grin. \"Vampires don't believe in crazy things like ghosts, do we, Larten?\"</p><p>Before Mr. Crepsley could reply, Harkat corrected himself. \"What I should... have said... is, I... was a ghost. All... Little People... were ghosts. Until... they agreed to terms... with Mr. Tiny.\"</p><p>\"I don't understand,\" Gavner said. \"Agreed to what terms? How?\"</p><p>\"Mr. Tiny can... talk with... dead,\" Harkat explained. \"I did not... leave Earth... when I died. Soul... could not. I was... stuck. Mr. Tiny found... me. Said he'd give... me a... body, so I... could live again. In return... I'd serve him, as a... Little Person.\"</p>","<p>According to Harkat, each of the Little People had struck a deal with Mr. Tiny, and each deal was different. They didn't have to serve him forever. Sooner or later, they would be freed, some to live on in the gray, short bodies, some to be reborn, others to move on to heaven or paradise or wherever it is that dead souls go.</p><p>\"Mr. Tiny has that much power?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>Harkat nodded.</p><p>\"What deal did you strike with him?\" I asked curiously.</p><p>\"I do not... know,\" he said. \"I cannot... remember.\"</p><p>There were lots of things he couldn't remember. He didn't know who he'd been when he was alive, when or where he'd lived, or how long he'd been dead. He didn't even know if he'd been a man or a woman! The Little People were genderless, which meant they were neither male nor female.</p><p>\"So how do we refer to you?\" Gavner asked. \"He? She? It?\"</p><p>\"He will... do fine,\" Harkat said.</p><p>Their blue robes and hoods were for show. Their masks, on the other hand, were necessary, and they carried several spares, some sewn under their skin for extra safekeeping! Air was lethal to them - if they breathed normal air for ten or twelve hours, they'd die. There were chemicals in their masks that purified the air.</p><p>\"How can you die of you're already dead?\" I asked, confused.</p><p>\"My body can... die, like anyone... else's. If it does... my soul goes... back to the way... it was.\"</p><p>\"Could you agree to another contract with Mr. Tiny?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>Harkat shook his head. \"Not sure. But don't... think so. One shot at... extra life is... all I think... we get.\"</p><p>The Little People could read each other's minds. That's why they never spoke. He wasn't sure if the others were able to speak or not. When asked why he'd never spoken before, he flashed a crooked grin and said he'd never had cause to.</p><p>\"But there must be a reason,\" Mr. Crepsley pressed. \"In all the hundreds of years that we have known them, no Little Person has ever spoken, even when dying or in great pain. Why have you broken that long silence? And why?\"</p><p>Harkat hesitated. \"I have a... message,\" he finally said. \"Mr. Tiny... gave me it... to give to... Vampire Princes. So I'd... have had to speak... soon anyway.\"</p><p>\"A message?\" Mr. Crepsley leaned forward intently, but pulled back into the shadows of the shelter when the sun hit him. \"What sort of message?\"</p><p>\"It is for... Princes,\" Harkat said. \"I do not... think I should... tell you.\"</p><p>\"Go on, Harkat,\" I urged him. \"We won't tell them you told us. You can trust us.\"</p><p>\"You will... not tell?\" he asked Mr. Crepsley and Gavner.</p><p>\"My lips are sealed,\" Gavner promised.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley was slower to make his pledge, but finally nodded.</p><p>Harkat took a deep, shuddering breath. \"Mr. Tiny told... me to tell... Princes that the... night of the... Vampaneze Lord... is at hand. That is... all.\"</p><p>\"The night of the Vampaneze Lord is at hand?\" I repeated. \"What kind of a message is that?\"</p><p>\"I do not... know what... it means,\" Harkat said. \"I'm just... the messenger.\"</p><p>\"Gavner, do you -\" I started to ask, but stopped when I saw the expressions of the vampires. Although Harkat's message didn't mean anything to me, it obviously meant a whole lot to them. Their faces were even paler than usual, and they were trembling with fear. In fact, they couldn't have looked more terrified if they'd been staked to the ground out in the open and left for the sun to rise!</p><p>Chapter TEN</p><p>MR. CREPSLEY AND GAVNER wouldn't explain the meaning of Harkat's message right away - they were too stunned to speak - and the story only trickled out over the next three or four nights, most of it coming from Gavner Purl.</p><p>It had to do with something Mr. Tiny told the vampires hundreds of years ago, when the vampaneze broke away. Once the fighting had died down, he visited the Princes at Vampire Mountain and told them that the vampaneze were not \"hierarchically structured\" (Mr. Crepsley's phrase), which meant there were no Vampaneze Generals or Princes. Nobody gave orders or bossed the others around.</p><p>\"That was one of the reasons they broke away,\" Gavner said. \"They didn't like the way things worked with vampires. They thought it was unfair that ordinary vampires had to answer to the Generals, and the Generals to the Princes.\"</p><p>Lowering his voice so that Mr. Crepsley couldn't hear, he said, \"To be honest, I agree with some of that. There is room for change. The vampire system has worked for hundreds of years, but that doesn't mean it's perfect.\"</p><p>\"Are you saying you'd rather be a vampaneze?\" I asked, shocked.</p><p>\"Of course not!\" He laughed. \"They kill, and allow mad vampaneze like Murlough to run around and do as they please. It's far better to be a vampire. But that doesn't mean that some of their ideas aren't worth taking on board.</p><p>\"Not flitting on the way to Vampire Mountain, for example - that's a ridiculous rule, but it can only be changed by the Princes, who don't have to change anything they don't want to, regardless of what the rest of us think. Generals have to do everything the Princes say, and ordinary vampires have to do everything Generals say.\"</p><p>Though the vampaneze didn't believe in leaders, Mr. Tiny said that one night a champion would step forward. He would be known as the Vampaneze Lord and the vampaneze would follow him blindly and do everything he said.</p><p>\"What's so bad about that?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Wait till you hear the next part,\" Gavner said gravely. Apparently, not long after the Vampaneze Lord came to power, he would lead the vampaneze into war against the vampires. It was a war, Mr. Tiny warned, that the vampires couldn't win. They would be wiped out.</p><p>\"Is that true?\" I asked, appalled.</p><p>Gavner shrugged. \"We've been asking ourselves that for seven hundred years. Nobody doubts Mr. Tiny's powers - he's proved before that he can see into the future - but sometimes he tells lies. He's an evil little worm.\"</p><p>\"Why didn't you go after the vampaneze and kill them all?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Mr. Tiny said that some vampaneze would survive and the Vampaneze Lord would come as promised. Besides, war with the vampaneze was exacting too heavy a toll. Humans were hunting us down and might have made an end of us. It was best to declare a truce and let matters lie.\"</p><p>\"Is there no way the vampires could beat the vampaneze?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I'm not sure,\" Gavner replied scratching his head. \"There are more vampires than vampaneze and we're as strong as they are, so I can't see why we shouldn't be able to get the better of them. But Mr. Tiny said numbers wouldn't matter.</p><p>\"There's one hope,\" he added. \"The Stone of Blood.\"</p><p>\"What's that?\"</p><p>\"You'll see when we get to Vampire Mountain. It's a magic icon, sacred to us. Mr. Tiny said that if we prevented it from falling into the hands of the vampaneze, one night, long after the battle has been fought and lost, there's a chance that vampires might rise from the ashes and prosper again.\"</p><p>\"How?\" I asked, frowning.</p><p>Gavner smiled. \"That question has puzzled vampires for as long as it's been asked. Let me know if you figure it out,\" he said with a wink, and drew the conversation to a troubling close.</p><p>A week later, we arrived at Vampire Mountain.</p><p>It wasn't the highest mountain in the region, but it was steep and rocky, and looked like it would be almost impossible to climb. \"Where's the palace?\" I asked, squinting up at the snowy peak, which seemed to point directly at the three-quarter moon overhead.</p><p>\"Palace?\" Mr. Crepsley replied.</p><p>\"Where the Vampire Princes live.\" Mr. Crepsley and Gavner burst out laughing. \"What's so funny?\" I snapped.</p><p>\"How long do you think we would escape detection if we built a palace on the side of a mountain?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"Then where...?\" Understanding dawned. \"It's inside the mountain!\"</p><p>\"Of course.\" Gavner smiled. \"The mountain's a giant hive of caves and chambers. Everything a vampire could wish for is stored within - coffins, vats of human blood, food, and wine. The only time you see vampires on the outside is when they're arriving or departing or going to hunt.\"</p><p>\"How do we get in?\" I asked.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley tapped the side of his nose. \"Watch and see.\"</p><p>We walked around the rocky base of the mountain. Mr. Crepsley and Gavner were full of excitement, though only Gavner let it show - the older vampire acted as dryly as ever, and it was only when he thought nobody was looking that he'd grin to himself and rub his hands together in anticipation.</p><p>We reached a stream that was about twenty feet wide. The water flowed swiftly through it and gushed away down to the flat plains beyond. While we were working our way upstream, a lone wolf appeared in the near distance and howled. Streak and the other wolves came to an immediate stop. Streak's ears pricked up; he listened a moment, then howled back. His tail was wagging when he looked at me.</p><p>\"He is saying good-bye,\" Mr. Crepsley informed me, but I'd guessed that already.</p><p>\"Do they have to go?\" I asked.</p><p>\"This is what they came for - to meet others of their kind. It would be cruel to ask them to stay with us.\"</p><p>I nodded glumly and reached down to scratch Streak's ears. \"Nice knowing you, Streak,\" I said. Then I patted Rudi. \"I'll miss you, you miserable little runt.\"</p><p>The adult wolves started to walk away. Rudi hesitated, looking from me to the departing wolves. For a second I thought he might choose to stick with me, but then he barked, rubbed his wet nose over the tops of my bare feet, and ran off after the others.</p><p>\"You'll see him again,\" Gavner promised. \"We'll look them up when we leave.\"</p><p>\"Sure.\" I sniffed, pretending I wasn't bothered. \"I'll be okay. They're just a pack of dumb old wolves. I don't care.\"</p><p>\"Of course you don't.\" Gavner smiled.</p><p>\"Come,\" Mr. Crepsley said, heading upstream. \"We cannot stand here all night, pining over a few mangy wolves.\" I glared at him, and he coughed uncomfortably. \"You know,\" he added softly, \"wolves never forget a face. The cub will remember you even when it is old and gray.\"</p><p>\"Really?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he said, then turned and resumed walking. Gavner and Harkat fell in behind him. I looked over my shoulder one last time at the departing wolves, sighed dejectedly, then I picked up my bag and followed.</p><p>Chapter ELEVEN</p><p>HE CROSSED ABOVE THE OPENING where the stream came tumbling out of the mountain. The noise was deafening, especially for supersensitive vampire ears, so we hurried on as quickly as possible. The rocks were slippery, and in some spots we had to form a chain. At one extra-icy patch, Gavner and me both slipped. I was in front, holding on to Mr. Crepsley, but the force of the fall broke our grip. Luckily, Harkat held on to Gavner and pulled the two of us up.</p><p>We reached the mouth of a tunnel a quarter of an hour later. We hadn't climbed very far up the mountain, but it was a steep drop when I looked down. I was glad we weren't climbing any higher.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley entered first. I went in after him. It was dark inside the tunnel. I was going to ask Mr. Crepsley if we should stop to set torches, but I realized that the farther in we crept, the brighter the tunnel became.</p><p>\"Where's the light coming from?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Luminous lichen,\" Mr. Crepsley replied.</p><p>\"Is that a tongue twister or an answer?\" I grumbled.</p><p>\"It's a form of fungus that gives off light,\" Gavner explained. \"It grows in certain caves and on the floors of some oceans.\"</p><p>\"Oh, right. Does it grow all over the mountain?\"</p><p>\"Not everywhere. We use torches where it doesn't.\" Ahead of us, Mr. Crepsley stopped and cursed. \"What's wrong?\" Gavner asked.</p><p>\"Cave-in,\" he sighed. \"There is no way through.\"</p><p>\"Does that mean we can't get in?\" I asked, alarmed at the thought of having trekked all this way for nothing, only to have to turn back at the very end.</p><p>\"There are other ways,\" Gavner said, \"The mountain's riddled with tunnels. We'll just have to backtrack and find another.\"</p><p>\"We had better hurry,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Dawn is fast approaching.\"</p><p>We shuffled back the way we'd come, Harkat in the lead this time. Outside, we moved as quickly as we could - which wasn't very fast, given the treacherous footing - and made it to the mouth of the next tunnel a few minutes after the sun had started to rise. This new tunnel wasn't as large as the other and the two full vampires had to walk bent double. Harkat and me just had to duck our heads. The luminous lichen didn't grow strongly here, though there was enough of it for our extra-sharp eyes to see by.</p><p>After a while I noticed that we were sloping downward instead of up. I asked Gavner about this. \"It's just the way the tunnel goes,\" he said. \"It'll lead upward eventually.\"</p><p>About half an hour later, we cut up. At one stage the tunnel veered upward almost vertically and we faced a difficult climb. The walls pressed tightly around us, and I'm sure I wasn't the only one whose mouth dried up with nerves. A little after the tunnel leveled out, it opened onto a small cave, where we stopped to rest. I could hear the stream we had crossed earlier churning along not far underneath our feet.</p><p>There were four tunnels leading out of the cave. I asked Gavner how Mr. Crepsley knew which one to take. \"The correct tunnel's marked,\" he said, leading me over to them and pointing to a tiny arrow that had been scratched into the wall at the bottom of one tunnel.</p>","<p>\"Where do the others lead?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Dead ends, other tunnels, or up to the Halls.\"</p><p>The Halls were what they called the parts of the mountain where the vampires lived. \"Many of the tunnels haven't been explored and there are no maps. Never wander off by yourself,\" he warned. \"You could get lost very easily.\"</p><p>While the others were resting, I checked on Madam Octa, to see if she was hungry. She'd slept through most of the journey - she didn't like the cold - but woke every once in a while to eat. As I was taking the cloth off her cage, I saw a spider creeping toward us. It wasn't as large as Madam Octa, but it looked dangerous.</p><p>\"Gavner!\" I called, stepping away from the cage.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\"</p><p>\"A spider.\"</p><p>\"Oh.\" He grinned. \"Don't worry - the mountain's full of them.\"</p><p>\"Are they poisonous?\" I asked, bending down to study the spider, which was examining the cage with great interest.</p><p>\"No,\" he answered. \"Their bite's no worse than a bee sting.\"</p><p>I removed the cloth, curious to see what Madam Octa would do when she spotted the strange spider. She took no notice of it, just sat where she was, while the other spider crawled over the cage. I knew a lot about spiders - I'd read a lot of books about arachnids and watched wildlife TV shows when I was younger - but hadn't seen any quite like this one before. It was hairier than most, and a weird yellow color.</p><p>Once the spider left, I fed Madam Octa a couple of insects and replaced the cloth. I lay down with the others and napped for a few hours. At one stage I thought I heard children giggling in one of the tunnels. I sat up, ears strained, but the sound didn't come to me again.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" Gavner groaned softly, half opening an eye.</p><p>\"Nothing,\" I said uncertainly, then asked Gavner if any vampire children lived in the mountain.</p><p>\"No,\" he said, closing his eye. \"You're the only blooded kid, as far as I know.\"</p><p>\"Then I must have been imagining things.\" I yawned, and lay down again, although I kept one ear cocked while I dozed.</p><p>Later we got up and proceeded farther up the mountain, taking the tunnels marked with arrows. After what seemed like ages we came to a large wooden door blocking the tunnel. Mr. Crepsley made himself presentable, then knocked loudly with his bare knuckles. There was no immediate answer, so he knocked again, then again.</p><p>Finally there were sounds of life on the other side of the door and it opened. Torchlight flared from within. It was blinding to us after so long in the tunnels, and we shielded our eyes until they adjusted.</p><p>A lean vampire in dark green clothes emerged and cast an eye over us. He frowned when he saw Harkat and me, and took a firmer grip on the long spear he was holding. I could see others behind him, dressed in green as well, none without a weapon.</p><p>\"Address yourselves to the gate,\" the guard barked. The vampires had told me this was how newcomers were greeted.</p><p>\"I am Larten Crepsley, come to seek Council,\" Mr. Crepsley said. It was the standard reply.</p><p>\"I am Gavner Purl, come to seek Council,\" Gavner said.</p><p>\"I am Darren Shan, come to seek Council,\" I told the guard.</p><p>\"I... Harkat Mulds. Come... seek Council,\" Harkat wheezed.</p><p>\"Larten Crepsley is recognized by the gate,\" the guard said. \"And Gavner Purl is recognized. But these other two...\" He pointed his spear at us and shook his head.</p><p>\"They are our traveling companions,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"The boy is my assistant, a half-vampire.\"</p><p>\"Do you vouch for him?\" the guard asked.</p><p>\"I do.\"</p><p>\"Then Darren Shan is recognized by the gate.\" The tip of his spear pointed firmly at Harkat now. \"But this is no vampire. What business has he at Council?\"</p><p>\"His name is Harkat Mulds. He is a Little Person. He-\"</p><p>\"A Little Person!\" The guard gasped, lowering his spear. He crouched and made a rude study of Harkat's face (Harkat had removed his hood soon after we entered the tunnels, so he could see better). \"He's an ugly specimen, isn't he?\" the guard remarked. If he hadn't been carrying a spear, I'd have told him off for speaking so inconsiderately. \"I thought the Little People couldn't speak.\"</p><p>\"We all thought that,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"But they can. At least, this one can. He has a message for the Princes, to be delivered in person.\"</p><p>\"A message?\" The guard scratched his chin with the tip of the spear. \"From who?\"</p><p>\"Desmond Tiny,\" Mr. Crepsley replied.</p><p>The guard blanched, stood to attention, and said quickly, \"The Little Person known as Harkat Mulds is recognized by the gate. The Halls are open to all of you. Enter and fare well.\"</p><p>He stepped aside and let us pass. A couple of seconds later the door closed behind us and our journey to the Halls of Vampire Mountain was at an end.</p><p>Chapter TWELVE</p><p>ONE OF THE GREEN-CLAD GUARDS escorted us to the Hall of Osca Velm, which was a Hall of welcome (most of the Halls were named after famous vampires). This was a small cavern, the walls knobbly and black with the grime and soot of decades. It was warmed and lit by a couple of open fires, the air pleasantly thick with smoke (the smoke slowly exited the cavern through natural cracks and holes in the ceiling). There were several roughly carved tables and benches where arriving vampires could rest and eat (the legs of the tables had been made from the bones of large animals). There were handwoven baskets full of shoes on the walls, which newcomers were free to pick from. You could also find out who was in attendance at the Council - a large black stone was set in one of the walls, and the name of every vampire who'd arrived was etched on it. As we sat at a long wooden table, I saw a vampire climb a ladder and add our names to the list. After Harkat's, he put in brackets, \"a Little Person.\"</p><p>There weren't many vampires in the quiet, smoky Hall - ourselves, a few more who had recently arrived, and a couple of green-uniformed guards. A vampire with long hair, wearing no shirt, came over to us with two round barrels. One of the barrels was packed to the top with loaves of hard bread, the other was half full of gristly pieces of both raw and cooked meat.</p><p>We took as much as we wanted to eat and set it down on the table (there were no plates), using our ringers and teeth to break off chunks. The vampire returned with three large jugs, filled with human blood, wine, and water. I asked for a mug, but Gavner told me you had to drink right from the jug. It was difficult - I soaked my chin and chest with water the first time I tried - but it was more fun than drinking out of a cup.</p><p>The bread was stale, but the vampire brought bowls of hot broth (the bowls were carved out of the skulls of various beasts), and the bread was fine if you tore a piece off and dipped it in the thick, dark broth for a few seconds. \"This is great,\" I said, munching away at my third slice.</p><p>\"The best,\" Gavner agreed. He was already on his fifth.</p><p>\"How come you're not having any broth?\" I asked Mr. Crepsley, who was eating his bread plain.</p><p>\"Bat broth does not agree with me,\" he replied.</p><p>My hand froze on its way to my mouth. The soaked piece of bread I'd been holding fell to the table. \"Bat broth? \"I yelped.</p><p>\"Of course,\" Gavner said. \"What did you think it was made of?\"</p><p>I stared down into the dark liquid of the bowl. The light was bad in the cavern, but now that I focused, I spotted a thin, leathery wing sticking out of the broth. \"I think I'm gonna be sick!\" I moaned.</p><p>\"Don't be stupid.\" Gavner chortled. \"You loved it when you didn't know what it was. Just get it down you and pretend it's nice, fresh chicken soup - you'll eat a lot worse than bat broth before your stay in Vampire Mountain's over!\"</p><p>I pushed the bowl away. \"Actually, I feel pretty full,\" I muttered. \"I'll leave it for now.\" I looked at Harkat, who was mopping up the last of his broth with a thick slice of bread. \"You don't mind eating bats?\" I asked.</p><p>Harkat shrugged. \"I have no taste... buds. Food is... all the same... to me.\"</p><p>\"You can't taste anything?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Bat... dog... mud - no difference. I have no... sense of smell... either. That's why... no nose.\"</p><p>\"That's something I meant to ask about,\" Gavner said. \"If you're not able to smell without a nose, how can you hear without ears?\"</p><p>\"I have... ears,\" Harkat said. \"They're under... skin.\" He pointed to two spots on either side of his round, green eyes. (He'd left his hood down.)</p><p>Gavner leaned over the table to examine Harkat's ears. \"I see them!\" he exclaimed, and we all leaned over to gawk. Harkat didn't mind - he liked the attention. His ears looked like dry dates, barely visible beneath the gray skin.</p><p>\"You can hear in spite of the skin stretched over them?\" Gavner asked.</p><p>\"Quite well,\" Harkat replied. \"Not as... good as vampires. But better... than humans.\"</p><p>\"How come you've got ears but no nose?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Mr. Tiny... didn't give me... nose. Never asked... why not. Maybe because... of air. Would need... another mask... for nose.</p><p>It was strange to think that Harkat couldn't smell the musky air of the Hall or taste the bat broth. No wonder the Little People never complained when I brought them rotting, stinking animals that had been dead for ages!</p><p>I was about to ask Harkat more about his limited senses when an ancient-looking vampire dressed in red sat down opposite Mr. Crepsley and smiled. \"I was expecting you weeks ago,\" he said. \"What took you so long?\"</p><p>\"Seba!\" Mr. Crepsley roared, and lunged across the table to clasp the older vampire's shoulders. I was surprised - I'd never seen him behave so warmly toward another person. He was beaming when he let the vampire go. \"It has been a long time, old friend.\"</p><p>\"Too long,\" the older vampire agreed. \"I have often searched for you mentally, in the hope that you were near. When I sensed you coming, I hardly dared believe it.\"</p><p>The older vampire ran an eye over Harkat and me. He was wrinkled and shrunken with age, but the light of a younger man burned brightly in his eyes. \"Are you going to introduce me to your friends, Larten?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Of course,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"You know Gavner Purl.\"</p><p>\"Gavner.\" The vampire nodded.</p><p>\"Seba,\" Gavner replied.</p><p>\"This is Harkat Mulds,\" Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>\"A Little Person,\" Seba noted. \"I have not seen one of those since Mr. Tiny visited us when I was a boy. Greetings, Harkat Mulds.\"</p><p>\"Hello,\" Harkat replied.</p><p>Seba blinked slowly. \"He talks?\"</p><p>\"Wait until you hear what he has to say,\" Mr. Crepsley said somberly. Then, turning to me, he said, \"And this is Darren Shan - my assistant.\"</p><p>\"Greetings, Darren Shan.\" Seba smiled at me. He looked at Mr. Crepsley strangely. \"You, Larten - with an assistant?\"</p><p>\"I know.\" Mr. Crepsley coughed. \"I always said I would never take one.\"</p><p>\"And so young,\" Seba murmured. \"The Princes will not approve.\"</p><p>\"Most probably not,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed miserably. Then he shook off his gloom. \"Darren, Harkat - this is Seba Nile, the quartermaster of Vampire Mountain. Do not let his age fool you - he is as sly, cunning, and quick as any vampire, and will get the better of those who try and best him.\"</p><p>\"As you know from experience.\" Seba chuckled. \"Do you remember when you set out to steal half a vat of my finest wine and replace it with a lesser vintage?\"</p><p>\"Please,\" Mr. Crepsley said, looking pained. \"I was young and foolish. There is no need to remind me.\"</p><p>\"What happened?\" I asked, delighted by the vampire's discomfort.</p><p>\"Tell him, Larten,\" Seba said, and Mr. Crepsley obeyed sullenly, like a child.</p><p>\"He got to the wine first,\" he muttered. \"Emptied the vat and replaced the wine with vinegar. I had swallowed half a bottle before I realized. I spent the rest of the night retching.\"</p><p>\"No!\" Gavner burst out laughing.</p><p>\"I was young,\" Mr. Crepsley growled. \"I did not know better.\"</p><p>\"But I taught you, Larten, did I not?\" Seba remarked.</p><p>\"Yes.\" Mr. Crepsley smiled. \"Seba was my tutor. I learned most of what I know at his hands.\"</p><p>The three vampires started talking about old times, and I sat listening. Most of what they said went right over my head - names of people and places that meant nothing to me - and after a while I sat back and gazed around the cavern, studying the flickering lights of the fires and the shapes the smoke made in the air. I only realized I was dozing off when Mr. Crepsley shook me gently and my eyes snapped open.</p><p>\"The boy is tired,\" Seba noted.</p><p>\"He has never made the journey before,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"He is not accustomed to such hardship.\"</p><p>\"Come,\" Seba said, standing. \"I will find rooms for you. He is not the only one who needs to rest. We will talk more tomorrow.\"</p><p>As the quartermaster of Vampire Mountain, Seba was in charge of the stores and living quarters. It was his job to make sure there was enough food and drink and blood for everyone, and that every vampire had a place to sleep. There were other vampires working for him, but he was the main man. Aside from the Princes, Seba was the most respected vampire in the mountain.</p><p>Seba asked me to walk beside him as we made our way from the Hall of Osca Velm to our sleeping quarters. He pointed out various Halls as we passed, and told me their names - most of which I couldn't pronounce, never mind remember - and what they were used for.</p>","<p>\"It will take a while to adjust,\" he said, seeing my dazed gaze. \"For the first few nights you may feel lost. But in time you will grow accustomed to the place.\"</p><p>The network of tunnels connecting the Halls to the sleeping quarters was cold and damp, even with the torches, but the tiny rooms - carved out of the rocks - were bright and warm, each lit by a powerful torch. Seba asked if we wanted one big room between us, or if we'd rather have separate quarters.</p><p>\"Separate,\" Mr. Crepsley immediately replied. \"I had enough of Gavner's snoring on the trail.\"</p><p>\"Charming!\" Gavner huffed.</p><p>\"Harkat and me don't mind doubling up, do we?\" I said, not liking the idea of being left on my own in such a weird place.</p><p>\"That's fine... by me,\" Harkat agreed.</p><p>All the rooms had coffins instead of beds, but when Seba saw my gloomy face, he laughed and said I could have a hammock if I wanted. \"I will send one of my staff to you tomorrow,\" he promised. \"Tell him what you need and he will get it - I look after my guests!\"</p><p>\"Thank you,\" I said, glad that I wouldn't have to sleep in the coffin every day.</p><p>Seba started to leave. \"Wait.\" Mr. Crepsley called him back. \"I have something to show you.\"</p><p>\"Oh?\" Seba smiled.</p><p>\"Darren,\" Mr. Crepsley said, \"fetch Madam Octa.\"</p><p>When Seba Nile saw the spider, his breath caught in his throat and he gazed at it as though mesmerized. \"Oh, Larten,\" he sighed. \"What a beauty!\" He took the cage from me - holding it carefully - and opened the door.</p><p>\"Stop!\" I hissed. \"Don't let her out - she's poisonous!\"</p><p>Seba only smiled and reached into the cage. \"I have never met a spider I have not been able to charm,\" he said.</p><p>\"But -\" I began.</p><p>\"It is all right, Darren,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Seba knows what he is doing.\"</p><p>The old vampire coaxed the spider onto his fingers and lifted her out of the cage. She squatted comfortably in the palm of his hand. Seba bent his face over her and whistled softly. The spider's legs twitched, and from her intent look, I knew he must be communicating mentally with her.</p><p>Seba stopped whistling and Madam Octa crawled up his arm. Upon reaching his shoulder, she nestled up to his chin and relaxed. I couldn't believe it! I'd always had to whistle continuously - with a flute, not my lips - and concentrate fiercely to keep her from biting me, but with Seba she was completely submissive.</p><p>\"She is marvelous,\" Seba said, stroking her. \"You must tell me more about her when you have a chance. I thought I knew of all the spiders in existence, but this one is new to me.\"</p><p>\"I thought you would like her.\" Mr. Crepsley beamed. \"That is why I brought her. I wish to make you a present of her.\"</p><p>\"You would part with such a wonderful spider?\" Seba asked.</p><p>\"For you, old friend - anything.\"</p><p>Seba smiled at Mr. Crepsley, then looked at Madam Octa. Sighing regretfully, he shook his head. \"I must refuse,\" he said. \"I am old, and not as sprightly as I used to be. I am kept busy trying to keep up with jobs I once zipped through. I do not have the time to care for such an exotic pet.\"</p><p>\"Are you sure?\" Mr. Crepsley asked, disappointed.</p><p>\"I would love to take her but I cannot.\" He placed Madam Octa back in her cage and handed it to me. \"Only the young have the energy to tend to the needs of spiders of such caliber. Look after her, Darren - she is beautiful and rare.\"</p><p>\"I'll keep my eye on her,\" I promised. I once thought the spider was beautiful, too, until she bit my best friend and led to me becoming a half-vampire.</p><p>\"Now,\" Seba said, \"I must go. You are not the only new arrivals. Until we meet again - farewell.\"</p><p>There were no doors on the tiny rooms. Mr. Crepsley and Gavner bid us good night before heading for their coffins. Harkat and me stepped into our room and studied our two caskets.</p><p>\"I don't think you'll fit in that,\" I said.</p><p>\"That is... okay. I can sleep... on floor.\"</p><p>\"In that case, see you tonight.\" I looked around the cave. \"Or will it be morning? Impossible to tell in here.\"</p><p>I didn't like getting into the coffin but took comfort in the fact that it was for one time only. Lying back, I left the lid open and stared up at the rocky gray ceiling. I thought that with the excitement of having arrived at Vampire Mountain, it'd take a long time to fall asleep, but within minutes I was out and slept just as content as I would have in my hammock back at the Cirque Du Freak.</p><p>Chapter THIRTEEN</p><p>HARKAT WAS STANDING by his coffin when I woke up, his green eyes wide open. I stretched and said good morning. There was a brief pause, then he shook his head and looked at me. \"Good morning,\" he replied.</p><p>\"Been awake long?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Just woke... now. When you... spoke to me. Fell asleep... standing up.\"</p><p>I frowned. \"But your eyes were open.\"</p><p>He nodded. \"Always open. No lids... or lashes. Can't shut them.\"</p><p>The more I learned about Harkat, the weirder he got! \"Does that mean you can see things while you're asleep?\"</p><p>\"Yes, but I... take no... notice of them.\"</p><p>Gavner appeared at the entrance to our room.</p><p>\"Rise and shine, boys,\" he boomed. \"Night's wearing on. There's work to be done. Anybody for bat broth?\"</p><p>I asked to use the bathroom before we went to eat. Gavner led me to a small door with the letters WC carved into it. \"What does that stand for?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Water closet,\" he informed me, then added, \"Don't fall in!\"</p><p>I thought that was a joke, but when I stepped inside, I realized it was a genuine warning - there was no toilet in the water closet, just a round hole in the ground that led to a gurgling mountain stream. I stared down the hole - it wasn't large enough for an adult to fall through, but somebody my size might just fit - and shivered when I saw dark, gushing water at the bottom. I didn't like the idea of squatting over the hole, but there was no other option, so I just did it.</p><p>\"Are all the toilets like that?\" I asked when I came out.</p><p>\"Yes.\" Gavner laughed. \"It's the easiest way to get rid of the waste. There are a couple of big streams leading out of the mountain and the toilets are built over them. The streams wash everything away.\"</p><p>Gavner led Harkat and me to the Hall of Khledon Lurt. Seba Nile had pointed out the Hall to me the day before and said it was where meals were served. He also told me a little about Khledon Lurt; he had been a General of great standing, who had died saving other vampires in the fight with the vampaneze, when they broke away.</p><p>Vampires loved telling tales about their ancestors. They kept only a few written records, choosing instead to keep their history alive by word of mouth, passing on stories and legends around fires or over tables from one generation to another.</p><p>Red drapes hung from the ceiling, covering the walls, and there was a large statue of Khledon Lurt at the center of the Hall. (Like most of the mountain's sculptures, it had been carved from the bones of animals.) The Hall was lit by strong torches, and it was almost full when we arrived. Gavner, Harkat, and me sat at a table with Mr. Crepsley, Seba Nile, and a bunch of vampires I didn't know. Talk was loud and rough. A lot of it had to do with fighting and daring acts of endurance.</p><p>This was my first good look at a crowd of vampires, and I spent more time gazing around than I did eating. They didn't look that different from humans, except many were scarred from battle and hard living, and not a single one - pretty obvious why! - was suntanned.</p><p>They were a smelly bunch. They didn't use deodorant, although a couple had strings of wildflowers or naturally scented herbs around their necks and wrists. Although vampires made sure they washed in the world of humans - a foul stench could lead a vampire hunter to his prey - here in the mountain hardly any of them bothered with such luxuries. With all the soot and dirt of the Halls, they didn't see the point - it was impossible to stay clean.</p><p>I noticed pretty much no women. After a long time scanning, I spotted one sitting at a table in a corner, and another serving food. Besides that, the vampires were all men. There were hardly any old people either; Seba seemed to be the oldest vampire present. I asked him about this.</p><p>\"Very few vampires live to be a ripe, old age,\" he replied. \"While vampires live far longer than humans, very few of us make it to our vampiric sixties or seventies.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Vampires measure age in two ways - earth years and vampire years,\" he explained. \"The vampiric age is the age of the body - physically, I am in my eighties. The earth age refers to how many years a vampire has been alive - I was a young boy when I was blooded, so I am seven hundred earth years old.\"</p><p>Seven hundred! It was an incredible age.</p><p>\"Though many vampires live for hundreds of earth years,\" Seba went on, \"hardly any make it to their vampiric sixties.\"</p><p>\"Why not? \"I asked.</p><p>\"Vampires live hard. We push ourselves to the limit, undergoing many tests of strength, wit, and courage. Hardly any sit around in pajamas and slippers, growing old quietly. Most, when they grow too old to care for themselves, meet death on their feet, rather than let their friends look after them.\"</p><p>\"How come you've lived so long then?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Darren!\" Mr. Crepsley snapped, shooting me a piercing glare.</p><p>\"Do not chastise the boy.\" Seba smiled. \"His open curiosity is refreshing. I have lived to this long age because of my position,\" he said to me. \"I was asked many decades ago to become the quartermaster of Vampire Mountain. It is not an enviable job, since it means living inside - hardly ever going hunting or fighting. But quartermasters are essential and much honored - it would have been impolite of me to refuse. If I was free, I would have been long dead by now, but one who does not exert oneself tends to live longer than those who do.\"</p><p>\"It seems crazy to me,\" I said. \"Why do you push yourselves so hard?\"</p><p>\"It is our way,\" Seba answered. \"Also, we have more time on our hands than humans, so it is less precious to us. If, in vampire years, a sixty-year-old man was blooded when he was twenty, he will have lived for more than four hundred earth years. A man grows tired of life when he has lived so much of it.\"</p><p>I was trying to see it from their point of view, but it was hard. Maybe I'd think differently when I'd been around a century or two!</p><p>Gavner rose before we finished eating and said he had to leave. He asked Harkat to accompany him.</p><p>\"Where are you going?\" I asked.</p><p>\"The Hall of Princes,\" he said. \"I must present myself to the Princes and tell them about the dead vampire and vampaneze we discovered. I also want to introduce Harkat, so he can pass on his message. The sooner the better, I think.\"</p><p>When they left, I asked Mr. Crepsley why we hadn't gone with them. \"It is not our place to present ourselves to the Princes,\" he said. \"Gavner is a General, so he has the right to ask to see the Princes. As ordinary vampires, we must wait to be invited before them.\"</p><p>\"But you used to be a General,\" I reminded him. \"They wouldn't mind if you popped in to say hello, would they?\"</p><p>\"Of course they would.\" Mr. Crepsley scowled, then turned to Seba and sighed. \"He is slow to learn our ways.\"</p><p>Seba laughed. \"And you are slow to learn the ways of the teacher. You forget how eagerly you questioned our way of life when you were blooded. I recall the night you stormed into my chambers and swore you would never become a General. You said Generals were backward imbeciles, and we should be looking to the future, not dwelling in the past.\"</p><p>\"I never said that!\" Mr. Crepsley gasped.</p><p>\"You certainly did,\" Seba insisted. \"And more! You were a fiery youth, and there were times when I thought you would never calm down. I was often tempted to dismiss you, but I did not. I let you ask your questions and air your rage, and in time you learned that yours was not the wisest head in the world, and that the old ways might indeed be best.</p><p>\"Students never appreciate their teachers while they are learning. It is only later, when they know more of the world, that they understand how indebted they are to those who instructed them. Good teachers expect no praise or love from the young. They wait for it, and in time, it comes.\"</p><p>\"Are you scolding me?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"Yes.\" Seba smiled. \"You are a fine vampire, Larten, but you have much to learn about teaching. Do not be so quick to criticize. Accept Darren's questions and stubbornness. Answer patiently and do not scold him for his opinions. Only in this way can he mature and develop as you did.\"</p><p>I extracted a guilty pleasure out of watching Mr. Crepsley being hauled down a peg or two. I was extremely close to the vampire, but his pomposity sometimes got on my nerves. It was fun to see him have his wrists slapped!</p><p>\"Stop smirking!\" he snapped when he saw me.</p><p>\"Now, now,\" I scolded him. \"You heard what Mr. Nile said - be patient - strive to understand me.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley was puffing himself up to roar at me when Seba coughed discreetly. The vampire glanced at his old teacher, the air wheezed out of him, and he grinned sheepishly. Instead of giving out, he politely asked me to pass him a loaf of bread.</p><p>\"My pleasure, Larten,\" I responded wryly, and the three of us shared a quiet laugh while the other vampires in the Hall of Khledon Lurt bellowed, told stories, and cracked mischievous jokes around us.</p><p>Chapter FOURTEEN</p><p>AFTER BREAKFAST, MR. CREPSLEY and me went to shower, since we were filthy from the trek. He said we wouldn't wash a lot while we were here, but a shower at the start was a good idea. The Hall of Perta Vin-Grahl was a huge cavern with modest stalactites and two natural waterfalls, set close together to the right of the door. The water fell from high up into a vampire-made pond and flowed to a hole near the back of the cavern, through which it disappeared and joined up with other streams underground.</p>","<p>\"What do you think of the waterfalls?\" Mr. Crepsley asked, raising his voice to be heard over the noise of the running water.</p><p>\"Beautiful,\" I said, admiring the way the torchlight reflected in the cascading water. \"But where are the showers?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley grinned sadistically and I realized where we were meant to wash.</p><p>\"No way!\" I shouted. \"The water must be freezing!\"</p><p>\"It is,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed, slipping off his clothes, \"but there are no other bathing facilities in Vampire Mountain.\"</p><p>I started to protest, but he laughed, walked to the nearest waterfall, and immersed himself in the spray. I felt chilly just looking at the vampire showering, but I'd been eager to wash, and I knew he'd mock me for the rest of our stay if I backed out. So, wriggling free of my clothes, I walked to the edge of the pond, tested the water with my toes - yowch! - then leaped forward and surrendered myself to the flow of the second waterfall.</p><p>\"Oh, man!\" I roared with ice-cold shock. \"This is torture!\"</p><p>\"Aye!\" Mr. Crepsley shouted. \"Now you understand why so few vampires bother to wash while at Council!\"</p><p>\"Is there a law against hot water?\" I screeched, furiously scrubbing my chest, back, and under my arms in a hurry to finish with the shower.</p><p>\"Not as such,\" Mr. Crepsley replied, stepping out of his waterfall and running a hand through his short crop of orange hair, before shaking it dry like a dog.</p><p>\"But cold water is good enough for nature's other creatures of the wilds - we prefer not to heat it, at least not here, in the heart of our homeland.\"</p><p>Rough, prickly towels had been laid out close to the pond, and I wrapped myself in two of them as soon as I got out from under the waterfall. For a few minutes I felt like my blood had turned to ice, but then my sensations returned, and I was able to enjoy the warmth of the thick towels.</p><p>\"Bracing,\" Mr. Crepsley commented, rubbing himself dry.</p><p>\"Murder, more like,\" I grumbled, though secretly I kind of enjoyed the originality of the primitive shower.</p><p>While we were dressing, I stared at the rocky ceiling and walls and wondered how old the Halls were. I asked Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>\"Nobody knows exactly when vampires first came here or how they found it,\" he said. \"The oldest discovered artifacts date back about three thousand years, but it is likely that for a long time it was only used occasionally, by small bands of wandering vampires.</p><p>\"As far as we know, the Halls were established as a permanent base about fourteen hundred years ago. That is when the first Princes moved in and the Councils began. The Halls have grown since then. There are vampires at work on the structure all the time, hollowing out new rooms, extending old ones, building tunnels. It is long, tiring work - no mechanical equipment is allowed - but we have plenty of time to attend to it.\"</p><p>By the time we emerged from the Hall of Perta Vin-Grahl, word of Harkat's message had spread. He had told the Princes that the night of the Vampaneze Lord was at hand, and the vampires were in an uproar. They milled around the mountain like ants, passing on the word to those who hadn't heard, discussing it hotly and making ridiculous plans to go out and kill all the vampaneze they could find.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley had promised to take me on a tour of the Halls, but postponed it because of the commotion. He said we'd go when things quieted down - I might be trampled by agitated vampires if we went now. I was disappointed, but knew he was right. This was no time to go exploring.</p><p>When we got back to my sleeping area, a young vampire had taken away our coffins and was stringing up hammocks. He offered to find new clothes for Mr. Crepsley and me if we wanted. We thanked him and accompanied him to one of the storerooms to be outfitted. The stores of Vampire Mountain were full of treasures - food and blood vats and hidden weapons - but I only got a brief look at these; the young vampire took us directly to the rooms where spare clothes were stored, and left us alone to pick whatever we liked.</p><p>I searched for a costume like my old one, but there were no pirate suits, so I chose a brown sweatshirt and dark pants, with a pair of soft shoes. Mr. Crepsley dressed all in red - his favorite color - although these clothes were less fancy than the ones he normally wore.</p><p>It was while he was adjusting his cape that I realized how similar his dress sense and Seba Nile's were. I mentioned it to him and he smiled. \"I have copied many of Seba's ways,\" he said. \"Not just his way of dressing, but also his way of speaking. I did not always use these precise, measured tones. When I was your age, I ran my words together the same as anybody. Years spent in the company of Seba taught me to slow down and consider my words before speaking.\"</p><p>\"You mean I might end up like you one day?\" I asked, alarmed at the thought of sounding so serious and stuffy.</p><p>\"You might,\" Mr. Crepsley said, \"though I would not bet on it. Seba commanded my utmost respect, so I tried hard to copy what he did. You, on the other hand, seem to be determined to do the opposite of everything I say.\"</p><p>\"I'm not that bad,\" I said, but there was some grain of truth in his words. I'd always been stubborn. I admired Mr. Crepsley more than he knew, but hated the idea of looking like a pushover who did everything he was told. Sometimes I disobeyed the vampire just so he wouldn't think I was paying attention to what he said!</p><p>\"Besides,\" Mr. Crepsley added, \"I have neither the heart nor the will to punish you when you make mistakes, as Seba punished me.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" I asked. \"What did he do?\"</p><p>\"He was a fair but hard teacher,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"When I told him of my desire to mimic him, he began paying close attention to my vocabulary. Whenever I said 'don't' or 'it's' or 'can't' - he would pluck a hair from inside my nose!\"</p><p>\"No way! \"I hooted.</p><p>\"It is true,\" he said glumly.</p><p>\"Did he use tweezers?\"</p><p>\"No - his fingernails.\"</p><p>\"Ow!\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley nodded. \"I asked him to stop - I said I no longer cared to copy him - but he would not - he believes in finishing what one starts. After several months of having the hairs ripped from inside my nostrils, I had a brain wave, and singed them with a red-hot rod - not something I recommend you try! - so they would not grow back.\"</p><p>\"What happened?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley blushed. \"He began plucking hairs from an even more tender spot.\"</p><p>\"Where? \"I quickly asked.</p><p>The vampire's blush deepened. \"I will not say - it is far too embarrassing.\"</p><p>(Later, when I got Seba by himself and asked him, he chortled wickedly and told me: \"His ears!\")</p><p>While we were putting our shoes on, a slender, blond vampire in a bright blue suit barged into the room and slammed the door behind him. He stood panting by the door, unaware of us, until Mr. Crepsley called to him, \"Is that you, Kurda?\"</p><p>\"No!\" the vampire yelled and grabbed for the handle. Then he paused and glanced over his shoulder. \"Larten?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Mr. Crepsley replied.</p><p>\"That's different.\" The vampire sauntered over. When he got closer, I saw that he had three small, red scars on his left cheek. They looked somehow familiar, but I couldn't think why. \"I was hoping to run into you. I wanted to ask about this Harkat Mulds person and his message. Is it true?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley shrugged. \"I have only heard the rumor.</p><p>He said nothing to us about it on our way here.\" Mr. Crepsley hadn't forgotten our promise to Harkat.</p><p>\"Not a word of it?\" the vampire asked, sitting on an upturned barrel.</p><p>\"He told us the message was for the Vampire Princes only,\" I said.</p><p>The vampire eyed me curiously. \"You must be the Darren Shan I've been hearing about.\" He shook my hand. \"I'm Kurda Smahlt.\"</p><p>\"What were you running from?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"Questions.\" Kurda groaned. \"As soon as word of the Little Person and his message circulated, everyone ran to me to ask if it was true.\"</p><p>\"Why should they ask you?\" Mr. Crepsley inquired.</p><p>\"Because I know more about the vampaneze than most. And because of my investiture - it's amazing how much more you're expected to know when you move up in the world.\"</p><p>\"Gavner Purl told me about that. Congratulations,\" Mr. Crepsley said rather stiffly.</p><p>\"You don't approve,\" Kurda noted.</p><p>\"I did not say that.\"</p><p>\"You didn't have to. It's written all over your face. But I don't mind. You're not the only one who objects. I'm used to the controversy.\"</p><p>\"Excuse me,\" I said, \"but what's an investiture?\"</p><p>\"That's what they call it when you move up in the organization,\" Kurda explained. He had a light way of speaking, and a smile was never far from his lips and eyes. He reminded me of Gavner, and I took an immediate liking to him.</p><p>\"Where are you moving to?\" I asked.</p><p>\"The top.\" He smiled. \"I'm being made a Prince. There'll be a big ceremony and a lot of to-do.\" He grimaced. \"It'll be a dull affair, I'm afraid, but there's no way around it. Centuries of tradition, standards to uphold, et cetera.\"</p><p>\"You should not speak dismissively of your investiture,\" Mr. Crepsley growled. \"It is a great honor.\"</p><p>\"I know.\" Kurda sighed. \"I just wish people wouldn't make such a big deal of it. It's not like I've done anything wondrous.\"</p><p>\"How do you become a Vampire Prince?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Why?\" Kurda replied, a twinkle in his eye. \"Thinking of applying for the job?\"</p><p>\"No.\" I chuckled. \"Just curious.\"</p><p>\"There's no fixed way,\" he said. \"To become a General, you study for a set number of years and pass regular tests. Princes, on the other hand, are elected sporadically and for different reasons.</p><p>\"Usually a Prince is someone who's distinguished himself in many battles, earning the trust and admiration of his colleagues. One of the established Princes nominates him. If the other Princes agree, he's automatically elevated up the ranks. If one objects, the Generals vote and the majority decision decides his fate. If two or more Princes object, the motion's rejected.</p><p>\"I squeezed in by the vote,\" he said with a grin. \"Fifty-four percent of the Generals think I'll make a fitting Prince. Which means that near enough one in two think I won't!\"</p><p>\"It was the tightest vote ever,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Kurda is only a hundred and twenty earth years old, making him one of the youngest Princes ever, and many Generals believe he is too young to command their respect. They will follow him once he is elected - there is no question of that - but they are not happy about it.\"</p><p>\"Come now,\" Kurda said. \"Don't cover up for me and leave the boy thinking it's my age they object to. Here, Darren.\" When I was standing beside him, he bent his right arm so that the biceps were bulging. \"What do you think?\"</p><p>\"They're not very big,\" I answered truthfully.</p><p>Kurda howled gleefully. \"May the gods of the vampires save us from honest children! But you're right - they're not big. Every other Prince has muscles the size of bowling balls. The Princes have always been the biggest, toughest, bravest vampires. I'm the first to be nominated because of this.\" He tapped his head. \"My brain.\"</p><p>\"You mean you're smarter than everybody else?\"</p><p>\"Way smarter,\" he said, then made a face. \"Not really.\" He sighed. \"I just use my brains more than most. I don't believe vampires should stick to the old ways as rigidly as they do. I think we should move forward and adapt to life in the twenty-first century. More than anything else, I believe we should strive to make peace with our estranged brothers - the vampaneze.\"</p><p>\"Kurda is the first vampire since the signing of the peace treaty to consort with the vampaneze,\" Mr. Crepsley said gruffly.</p><p>\"Consort?\" I asked uncertainly.</p><p>\"I've been meeting with them,\" Kurda explained. \"I've spent much of the last thirty or forty years tracking them down, talking, getting to know them. That's where I got my scars.\" He tapped the left side of his face. \"I had to agree to let them mark me - it was a way of offering myself to them and placing myself at their mercy.\"</p><p>Now I knew why the scars looked familiar - I'd seen similar marks on a human that the mad vampaneze Murlough had targeted six years earlier! Vampaneze were traditionalists and marked their prey before a kill, always the same three scratches on the left cheek.</p><p>\"The vampaneze aren't as different from us as most vampires believe,\" Kurda continued. \"Many would jump at the chance to return to the fold. Compromises will have to be made - both sides must back down on certain issues - but I'm sure we can come to terms and live together again, as one.\"</p><p>\"That is why he is being invested,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"A lot of the Generals - fifty-four percent, in any case - think it is time we were reunited with the vampaneze. The vampaneze trust Kurda but are reluctant to commit to negotiations with other Generals. When Kurda is a Prince, he will have total control over the Generals, and the vampaneze know no General would disobey the order of a Prince. So if he sends a vampire along to discuss terms, the vampaneze will trust him and sit down to talk. Or so the reasoning goes.\"</p><p>\"You don't agree with it, Larten?\" Kurda asked.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley looked troubled. \"There is much about the vampaneze that I admire, and I have never been opposed to talks designed to bridge the gap between us. But I would not be so quick to give them a voice among the Princes.\"</p>","<p>\"You think they might use me to force more of their beliefs on us than we force on them?\" Kurda suggested.</p><p>\"Something like that.\"</p><p>Kurda shook his head. \"I'm looking to create a tribe of equals. I won't force any changes through that the other Princes and Generals don't agree with.\"</p><p>\"If that is so, luck to you. But things are happening too fast for my liking. Were I a General, I would have campaigned as hard as I could against you.\"</p><p>\"I hope I live long enough to prove your distrust of me ill-founded.\" Kurda sighed, then turned to me. \"What do you think, Darren? Is it time for a change?\"</p><p>I hesitated before answering. \"I don't know enough about the vampires or vampaneze to offer an opinion,\" I said.</p><p>\"Nonsense,\" Kurda huffed. \"Everyone's entitled to an opinion. Go on, Darren, tell me what you think. I like to know what's on people's minds. The world would be a simpler and safer place if we all spoke our true thoughts.\"</p><p>\"Well,\" I said slowly, \"I'm not sure I like the idea of doing a deal with the vampaneze - I think it's wrong to kill humans when you drink from them - but if you could persuade them to stop killing, it might be a good thing.\"</p><p>\"This boy has brains,\" Kurda said, winking at me. \"What you said just about sums up my own arguments in a nutshell. The killing of humans is deplorable and it's one of the concessions the vampaneze will have to make before a deal can be forged. But unless we draw them into talks and earn their trust, they'll never stop. Wouldn't it be worth giving up a few of our ways if we could stop the bloody murder?\"</p><p>\"Absolutely,\" I agreed.</p><p>\"Hurm!\" Mr. Crepsley grunted, and wouldn't talk anymore about the subject.</p><p>\"Anyway,\" Kurda said, \"I can't stay hidden forever. Time to return and fend off more questions. You're sure there's nothing you can tell me about the Little Person and his message?\"</p><p>\"Afraid not,\" Mr. Crepsley said curtly.</p><p>\"Oh, well. I suppose I'll find out when I report to the Hall of Princes and see him myself. I hope you enjoy your stay in Vampire Mountain, Darren. We must get together once the chaos has died down and have a proper chat.\"</p><p>\"I'd like that,\" I said.</p><p>\"Larten.\" He saluted Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>\"Kurda.\"</p><p>He let himself out.</p><p>\"Kurda's nice,\" I remarked. \"I like him.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley glanced at me sideways, stroked the long scar on his own left cheek, gazed thoughtfully at the door Kurda had left by, and again went, \"Hurm!\"</p><p>Chapter FIFTEEN</p><p>ACOUPLE OF LONG, quiet nights passed. Harkat had been kept in the Hall of Princes to answer questions. Gavner had General business to attend to, and we only saw him when he crawled back to his coffin to sleep. I hung out with Mr. Crepsley in the Hall of Khledon Lurt most of the time - he had a lot of catching up to do with old friends he hadn't seen in many years - or down in the stores with him and Seba Nile.</p><p>The elderly vampire was more disturbed than most of the others by Harkat's message. He was the second oldest vampire in the mountain - the oldest was a Prince, Paris Skyle, who was more than eight hundred - and the only one who'd been here when Mr. Tiny visited and made his announcement all those centuries ago.</p><p>\"A lot of today's vampires do not believe the old stories,\" he said. \"They think Mr. Tiny's warning was something we made up to frighten young vampires. But I remember how he looked. I recall the way his words echoed around the Hall of Princes, and the fear they instilled in everyone. The Vampaneze Lord is no mere figure of legend. He is real. And now, it seems, he is coming.\"</p><p>Seba lapsed into silence. He'd been drinking a mug of warm beer but had lost interest in it.</p><p>\"He has not come yet,\" Mr. Crepsley said spiritedly. \"Mr. Tiny is as old as time itself. When he says the night is at hand, he might mean hundreds or thousands of years from now.\"</p><p>Seba shook his head. \"We have had our hundreds of years - seven centuries to make a stand and tackle the vampaneze. We should have finished them off, regardless of the consequences. Better to have been driven to the point of extinction by humans than wiped out entirely by the vampaneze.\"</p><p>\"That is foolish talk,\" Mr. Crepsley snapped. \"I would rather take my chances with a mythical Vampaneze Lord than a real, stake-wielding human. So would you.\"</p><p>Seba nodded glumly and sipped at his beer. \"You are probably right. I am old. My brain does not work as sharply as it used to. Perhaps my worries are those of an old man who has lived too long. Still...\"</p><p>Such pessimistic words were on everybody's lips. Even those who scoffed outright at the idea of a Vampaneze Lord always seemed to end with a \"still...\" or \"however...\" or \"but...\" The tension was clogging the dusty mountain air of the tunnels and Halls, constantly building, stifling everyone who was present.</p><p>The only one who didn't seem troubled by the rumors was Kurda Smahlt. He turned up outside our chambers, as upbeat as ever, the third night after Harkat had delivered his message.</p><p>\"Greetings,\" he said. \"I've had a hectic two nights, but things are calming down at last and I have a few free hours. I thought I'd take Darren on a tour of the Halls.\"</p><p>\"Great!\" I beamed. \"Mr. Crepsley was going to take me but we never got around to it.\"</p><p>\"You don't mind if I escort him, Larten?\" Kurda asked.</p><p>\"Not in the slightest,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"I am overwhelmed that one of your eminence has found the time to act as a guide so close to your investiture.\" He said it cuttingly, but Kurda ignored the elder vampire's sarcasm.</p><p>\"You can tag along if you want,\" Kurda offered cheerfully.</p><p>\"No thank you.\" Mr. Crepsley smiled thinly. \"Okay,\" Kurda said. \"Your loss. Ready, Darren?\"</p><p>\"Ready,\" I said, and off we went.</p><p>Kurda took me to see the kitchens first. They were huge caves, built deep beneath most of the Halls. Large fires burned brightly. The cooks worked in shifts around the clock during times of Council. They had to in order to feed all the visitors.</p><p>\"It's quieter the rest of the time,\" Kurda said. \"There are usually no more than thirty vampires in residence. You often have to cook for yourself if you don't eat with the rest at the set times.\"</p><p>From the kitchens we progressed to the breeding Halls, where sheep, goats, and cows were kept and bred. \"We'd never be able to ship in enough milk and meat to feed all the vampires,\" Kurda explained when I asked why live animals were kept in the mountain. \"This isn't a hotel, where you can call a supplier and restock anytime you want. Shipping in food is an enormous hassle. It's easier to rear the animals ourselves and butcher them when we need to.\"</p><p>\"What about human blood?\" I asked. \"Where does that come from?\"</p><p>\"Generous donors.\" Kurda winked, and led me on. (I only realized much later that he'd sidestepped the question.)</p><p>The Hall of Cremation was our next stop. It was where vampires who died in the mountain were cremated. \"What if they don't want to be cremated?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Oddly enough, hardly any vampires ask to be buried,\" he said. \"Perhaps it has something to do with all the time they spend in coffins while they're alive. However, if someone requests a burial, their wishes are respected.</p><p>\"Not so long ago, we'd lower the dead into an underground stream and let the water wash them away. There's a cave, far below the Halls, where one of the larger streams opens up. It's called the Hall of Final Voyage, although it's never used now. I'll show it to you if we're ever down that way.\"</p><p>\"Why should we be down there?\" I asked. \"I thought those tunnels were only used to get in and out of the mountain.\"</p><p>\"One of my hobbies is mapmaking,\" Kurda said. \"I've been trying to make accurate maps of the mountain for decades. The Halls are easy but the tunnels are much more difficult. They've never been mapped, and a lot are in poor shape. I try to get down to them whenever I return, to map out a few more unknown regions, but I don't have as much time to work on them as I'd like. I'll have even less when I'm a Prince.\"</p><p>\"It sounds like an interesting hobby,\" I said. \"Could I come with you the next time you go mapping? I'd like to see how it's done.\"</p><p>\"You're really interested?\" He sounded surprised.</p><p>\"Why shouldn't I be?\"</p><p>He laughed. \"I'm used to vampires falling asleep whenever I start talking about maps. Most have no interest in such mundane matters. There's a saying among vampires: 'Maps are for humans. Most vampires would rather discover new territory for themselves, regardless of the dangers, than follow directions on a map.\"</p><p>The Hall of Cremation was a large octagonal room with a high ceiling full of cracks. There was a pit in the middle - where the dead vampires were burned - and a couple of long, gnarly benches on the far side, made out of bones. Two women and a man were sitting on the benches, whispering to each other, and a young child was at their feet, playing with a scattering of animal bones. They didn't have the appearance of vampires - they were thin and ill-looking, with lank hair and rags for clothes; their skin was deathly pale and dry, and their eyes were an eerie white color. The adults stood when we entered, grabbed the child, and withdrew through a door at the back of the room.</p><p>\"Who were they?\" I asked.</p><p>\"The Guardians of this chamber,\" Kurda replied.</p><p>\"Are they vampires?\" I pressed. \"They didn't look like vampires. And I thought I was the only child vampire in the mountain.\"</p><p>\"You are,\" Kurda said.</p><p>\"Then who -\"</p><p>\"Ask me later!\" Kurda snapped with unusual briskness. I blinked at his sharp tone, and he smiled an immediate apology. \"I'll tell you about them when our tour is complete,\" he said softly. \"It's bad luck to talk about them here. Though I'm not superstitious by nature, I prefer not to test the fates where the Guardians are concerned.\"</p><p>(Although he'd aroused my curiosity, I didn't learn more about the strange, so-called Guardians until much later, since by the end of our tour I was in no state to ask any questions, and had forgotten about them entirely.)</p><p>Letting the matter of the Guardians drop, I examined the cremation pit, which was just a hollow dip in the ground. There were leaves and sticks in the bottom, waiting to be lit. Large pots were set around the hole, a clublike stick in each. I asked what they were for.</p><p>\"Those are pestles, for the bones,\" Kurda said.</p><p>\"What bones?\"</p><p>\"The bones of the vampires. Fire doesn't burn bones. Once a fire's burned out, the bones are extracted, put in the pots, and ground down to dust with the pestles.\"</p><p>\"What happens to the dust?\" I asked.</p><p>\"We use it to thicken bat broth,\" Kurda said earnestly, then burst out laughing as my face turned green. \"I'm joking! The dust is thrown to the winds around Vampire Mountain, setting the spirit of the dead vampire free.\"</p><p>\"I'm not sure I'd like that,\" I commented.</p><p>\"It's better than burying a person and leaving them to the worms,\" Kurda said. \"Although, personally speaking, I want to be stuffed and mounted when my time comes.\" He paused for a second, then burst out laughing again.</p><p>Leaving the Hall of Cremation, we set out for the three Halls of Sport (individually they were called the Hall of Basker Wrent, the Hall of Rush Flon'x, and the Hall of Oceen Pird, although most vampires referred to them simply as the Halls of Sport). I was eager to see the gaming Halls, but as we made our way there, Kurda paused in front of a small door, bowed his head, closed his eyes, and touched his eyelids with his fingertips.</p><p>\"Why did you do that?\" I asked.</p><p>\"It's the custom,\" he said, and moved on. I stayed, staring at the door.</p><p>\"What's this Hall called?\" I asked.</p><p>Kurda hesitated. \"You don't want to go in there,\" he said.</p><p>\"Why not?\" I pressed.</p><p>\"It's the Hall of Death,\" he said quietly.</p><p>\"Another cremation Hall?\"</p><p>He shook his head. \"A place of execution.\"</p><p>\"Execution?\" I was really curious now. Kurda saw this and sighed.</p><p>\"You want to go in?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Can I?\"</p><p>\"Yes, but it's not a pretty sight. It would be better to proceed directly to the Halls of Sport.\"</p><p>A warning like that only made me more eager to see what lurked behind the door! Noting this, Kurda opened it and led me in. The Hall was poorly lit, and at first I thought it was deserted. Then I spotted one of the white-skinned Guardians, sitting in the shadows of the wall at the rear. He didn't rise or give any sign that he saw us. I started to ask Kurda about him, but the General shook his head instantly and hissed quietly, \"I'm definitely not talking about them here!\"</p><p>I could see nothing awful about the Hall. There was a pit in the center of the floor and light wooden cages set against the walls, but otherwise it was bare and unremarkable.</p><p>\"What's so bad about this place?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I'll show you,\" Kurda said, and guided me toward the edge of the pit. Looking down into the gloom, I saw dozens of sharpened poles set in the floor, pointing menacingly toward the ceiling.</p><p>\"Stakes!\" I gasped.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Kurda said softly. \"This is where the legend of the stake through the heart originated. When a vampire's brought to the Hall of Death, he's placed in a cage - that's what the cages against the walls are for - which is attached to ropes and hoisted above the pit. He's then dropped from a height and impaled on the stakes. Death is often slow and painful, and it's not unusual for a vampire to have to be dropped three or four times before he dies.\"</p>","<p>\"But why?\" I was appalled. \"Who do they kill here?\"</p><p>\"The old or crippled, along with mad and treacherous vampires,\" Kurda answered. \"The old or crippled vampires ask to be killed. If they're strong enough, they prefer to fight to the death, or wander off into the wilderness to die hunting. But those who lack the strength or ability to die on their feet ask to come here, where they can meet death head-on and die bravely.\"</p><p>\"That's horrible!\" I cried. \"The elderly shouldn't be killed off!\"</p><p>\"I agree,\" Kurda said. \"I think the nobility of the vampires is misplaced. The old and infirm often have much to offer, and I personally hope to cling to life as long as possible. But most vampires hold to the ancient belief that they can only lead worthwhile lives as long as they're fit enough to fend for themselves.</p><p>\"It's different with mad vampires,\" he went on. \"Unlike the vampaneze, we choose not to let our insane members run loose in the world, free to torment and prey on humans. Since they're too difficult to imprison - a mad vampire will claw his way through a stone wall - execution is the most humane way to deal with them.\"</p><p>\"You could put them in strait-jackets,\" I suggested.</p><p>Kurda smiled sourly. \"There hasn't been a strait-jacket invented that could hold a vampire. Believe me, Darren, killing a mad vampire is a mercy, to the world in general and the vampire himself.</p><p>\"The same goes for treacherous vampires,\" he added, \"though there have been precious few of those - loyalty is something we excel at; one of the bonuses of sticking to the old ways so rigidly. Aside from the vampaneze - when they broke away, they were called traitors; many were captured and killed - there have been only six traitors executed in the fourteen hundred years that vampires have lived here.\"</p><p>I stared down at the stakes and shivered, imagining myself tied in a cage, hanging above the pit, waiting to fall.</p><p>\"Do you give them blindfolds?\" I asked.</p><p>\"The mad vampires, yes, because it is merciful. Vampires who have chosen to die in the Hall of Death prefer to do without one - they like to look death in the eye, to show they're not afraid. Traitors, meanwhile, are placed in the cages faceup, so their backs are to the stakes. It's a great dishonor for a vampire to die from stab wounds in the back.\"</p><p>\"I'd rather get it in the back than the front.\" I snorted.</p><p>Kurda smiled. \"Hopefully, you'll never get it in either!\" Then, clapping my shoulder, he said, \"This is a gloomy place, best avoided. Let's go play some games.\" And he swiftly ushered me out of the Hall, eagerly leaving behind its mysterious Guardian, the cages, and the stakes.</p><p>Chapter SIXTEEN</p><p>THE HALLS OF SPORT were gigantic caverns, full of shouting, cheering, high-spirited vampires. They were exactly what I needed to perk me up after the disturbing visit to the Halls of Cremation and Death.</p><p>Various contests took place in each of the three Halls. They were mostly games of physical combat - wrestling, boxing, karate, weight lifting, and so on - though speed chess was also strongly favored, since it sharpened one's reactions and wits.</p><p>Kurda found seats for us near a wrestling circle, and we watched as vampires tried to pin their opponents down or toss them out of the ring. You needed a quick eye to keep up with the action - vampires move far faster than humans. It was like watching a fight on video while keeping the fast-forward button pressed.</p><p>The bouts weren't just faster than their human equivalents - they were more violent, too. Broken bones, bloody faces, and bruises were the order of the night. Sometimes, Kurda told me, the damage was even worse - vampires could be killed taking part in these games, or injured so badly that a trip to the Hall of Death was all they had to look forward to.</p><p>\"Why don't they wear protective clothing?\" I asked.</p><p>\"They don't believe in it,\" Kurda said. \"They'd rather have their skulls cracked than wear helmets.\" He sighed morosely. \"There are times when I think I don't know my people at all. Maybe I'd have been better off if I'd remained human.\"</p><p>We moved to another ring. In this one, vampires jabbed at each other with spears. It was a little like fencing - you had to prick or cut an opponent three times to win - only a lot more dangerous and bloody.</p><p>\"It's horrendous.\" I gasped as a vampire had half his upper arm sliced open, only to laugh and compliment his enemy for making a good strike.</p><p>\"You should see it when they play for real,\" someone said behind us. \"They're just warming up at the moment.\" Turning, I saw a ginger-haired vampire who had only one eye. He was clad in a dark blue leather tunic and pants. \"They call this game the eyeballer,\" he informed me, \"because so many people lose an eye or two playing it.\"</p><p>\"Is that how you lost yours?\" I asked, staring at his empty left eye socket and the scars around it.</p><p>\"No.\" He chuckled. \"I lost mine in a fight with a lion.\"</p><p>\"Honest?\" I gasped.</p><p>\"Honest.\"</p><p>\"Darren, this is Vanez Blane,\" Kurda said. \"Vanez, this is -\"</p><p>\"Darren Shan.\" Vanez nodded, shaking my hand. \"I know him from the gossip. It's been a long time since one his age trod the Halls of Vampire Mountain.\"</p><p>\"Vanez is a games master,\" Kurda explained.</p><p>\"You're in charge of the games?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Hardly in charge,\" Vanez said. \"The games are beyond the control of even the Princes. Vampires fight - it's in our blood. If not here, where their injuries can be tended to, then in the open, where they might bleed to death unaided. I keep an eye on things, that's all.\" He grinned.</p><p>\"He also trains vampires to fight,\" Kurda said. \"Vanez is one of our most valued instructors. Most Generals of the last hundred years have studied under him. Myself included.\" He rubbed the back of his head and grimaced.</p><p>\"Still sore about that time I knocked you unconscious with a mace, Kurda?\" Vanez inquired politely.</p><p>\"You wouldn't have had the chance if I'd known what it was in advance,\" Kurda sulked. \"I thought it was a bowl of incense!\"</p><p>Vanez bellowed with laughter and slapped his knees. \"You always were a bright one, Kurda - except when it came to the tools of war. One of my worst pupils,\" he told me. \"Fast as an eel, and wiry, but he hated getting his hands bloody. A shame, as he would have been a wonder with a spear if he'd set his mind to it.\"</p><p>\"There's nothing wonderful about losing an eye in a fight,\" Kurda huffed.</p><p>\"There is if you win,\" Vanez disagreed. \"Any injury's acceptable as long as you emerge victorious.\"</p><p>We watched the vampires cutting each other to pieces for another half an hour - nobody lost an eye while we were there - then Vanez led us around the Halls, explaining the games to me and how they served to toughen vampires up and prepare them for life in the outside world.</p><p>All sorts of weapons hung from the walls of the Halls - some antiques, some for general use - and Vanez told me their names and how they were used; he even got a few down to demonstrate. They were fearsome instruments of destruction - jagged spears, sharp axes, long and glinting knives, heavy maces, blade-edged boomerangs that could kill from eighty yards, clubs with thick spikes sticking out of them, stone-head war hammers that could cave in a vampire's skull with one well-placed blow. After a while I noticed there were no guns or bows and arrows, and I asked about their absence.</p><p>\"Vampires only fight hand to hand,\" Vanez informed me. \"We do not use missile devices, such as guns, bows, or slings.\"</p><p>\"Never?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Never!\" he said firmly. \"Our reliance on hand weapons is sacred to us - to the vampaneze as well. Any vampire who resorted to a gun or bow would be held in contempt for the rest of his life.\"</p><p>\"Things used to be even more backward,\" Kurda chimed in. \"Until two hundred years ago, a vampire was only supposed to use a weapon of his own making. Every vampire had to make his own knives, spears, and clubs. Now, thankfully, that's no longer the case, and we can use store-bought equipment; but many vampires still cling to the old ways, and most of the weapons used during Council are handmade.\"</p><p>Moving away from the weapons, we stopped beside a series of overlapping narrow planks. Vampires were balancing on the planks and crossing from one to another, trying to knock their opponents to the ground with long, round-ended staffs. There were six vampires in action when we arrived. A few minutes later, only one remained aloft - a woman.</p><p>\"Well done, Arra.\" Vanez clapped. \"Your sense of balance is as awesome as ever.\"</p><p>The female vampire leaped from the plank and landed beside us. She was dressed in a white shirt and beige pants. She had long, dark hair, tied behind her back. She wasn't especially pretty - she had a hard, weathered face - but after so much time spent staring at ugly, scarred vampires, she looked like a movie star to me.</p><p>\"Kurda, Vanez,\" she greeted the vampires, then fixed her cool, gray eyes on me. \"And you are Darren Shan.\" She sounded decidedly unimpressed.</p><p>\"Darren, this is Arra Sails,\" Kurda said. I stuck out a hand but she ignored it.</p><p>\"Arra doesn't shake the hands of those she doesn't respect,\" Vanez whispered.</p><p>\"And she respects precious few of us,\" Kurda said aloud. \"Still refusing to shake hands with me, Arra?\"</p><p>\"I will never shake the hand of one who does not fight,\" she said. \"When you become a Prince, I will bow to you and do your bidding, but I will never shake your hand, even under threat of execution.\"</p><p>\"I don't think Arra voted for me in the election,\" Kurda said humorously.</p><p>\"I didn't vote for you either,\" Vanez said, with a wicked grin.</p><p>\"See what an average day is like for me, Darren?\" Kurda groaned. \"Half the vampires here love to rub my nose in the fact that they didn't vote for me, while the half who did almost never admit it in public, for fear the others would look down their noses at them.\"</p><p>\"Never mind.\" Vanez chuckled. \"We'll all have to kowtow to you when you're a Prince. We're just getting our digs in while we can.\"</p><p>\"Is it illegal to make fun of a Prince?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Not as such,\" Vanez said. \"It just isn't done.\"</p><p>I examined Arra while she was picking a splinter off of one of the rounded ends of her staff. She seemed to be as tough as any male vampire, not as burly, but just as muscular. While I was studying her, I got to thinking about how few female vampires I'd seen, and asked about it.</p><p>There was a long silence. The two men looked embarrassed. I was going to let the matter drop when Arra glanced at me archly and said, \"Women do not make good vampires. The entire clan's barren, so the life doesn't appeal to many of us.\"</p><p>\"Barren?\" I inquired.</p><p>\"We can't have children,\" she said.</p><p>\"What- none of you?\"</p><p>\"It's something to do with our blood,\" Kurda said. \"No vampire can sire or bear a child. The only way we can add to our ranks is by blooding humans.\"</p><p>I was stunned. Of course, a long time ago I should have stopped to wonder why there were no vampire children, and why everyone was so surprised to meet a young half-vampire. But I had so much else on my mind, I never really stopped to consider it.</p><p>\"Does that rule apply to half-vampires, too?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I'm afraid so,\" Kurda said, frowning. \"Larten never mentioned it?\"</p><p>I shook my head numbly. I couldn't have children! It wasn't something I'd thought about much - seeing as how I aged at a fifth the human rate, it would be a long time before I was ready to become a parent - but I had always assumed I'd have the choice. It was alarming to learn that I could never father a son or daughter.</p><p>\"This is bad,\" Kurda muttered. \"This is very, very bad.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Vampires are supposed to inform new recruits of such things before they blood them. It's one of the reasons we almost never blood children - we prefer new vampires to know what they're getting into and what they're giving up. To blood a boy your age was bad enough, but to do it without telling you all the facts...\" Kurda shook his head glumly and shared an uncertain look with Arra and Vanez.</p><p>\"You'll have to tell the Princes about this,\" Arra said.</p><p>\"They must be informed,\" Kurda agreed, \"but I'm sure Larten means to tell them himself. I'll wait and let him speak. It would be unfair to jump in before he has a chance to put his side of the story forward. Will you two keep this to yourselves?\"</p><p>Vanez nodded and, moments later, Arra did, too. \"But if he doesn't make mention of it soon...,\" Arra growled threateningly.</p><p>\"I don't understand,\" I said. \"Will Mr. Crepsley get into trouble for blooding me?\"</p><p>Kurda shared another glance with Arra and Vanez. \"Probably not,\" he said, trying to make light of it. \"Larten's a sly, old vampire. He knows the ropes. I'm sure he'll be able to explain it away to the satisfaction of the Princes.\"</p><p>\"Now,\" Vanez said before I could ask any more questions, \"how would you like to try out the bars with Arra?\"</p><p>\"You mean have a go on the planks?\" I asked, thrilled.</p><p>\"I'm sure we can find a staff to suit you. How about it, Arra? Any objections to fighting a smaller opponent?\"</p><p>\"It will be a novel experience,\" the vampiress mused. \"I'm accustomed to tackling men larger than myself. It will be interesting to fight one smaller.\"</p><p>She hopped up onto the planks and twirled her staff over her head and under her arms. It spun faster than my eyes could follow, and I began having second thoughts about getting up there with her; but I'd look like a coward if I backed out now.</p>","<p>Vanez found a staff small enough for me and spent a few minutes showing me how to use it. \"Hold it in the middle,\" he instructed. \"That way you can attack with either end. Don't swing too hard or you'll leave yourself open to a counterstrike. Jab at her legs and stomach. Forget about her head - you're too short to aim so high. Try tripping her. Go for her knees and toes - those are the soft points.\"</p><p>\"What about defending himself?\" Kurda interrupted. \"I think that's more important. It's been eleven years since Arra was beaten on the bars. Show him how to stop her cracking his head open, Vanez, and forget the other stuff.\"</p><p>Vanez showed me how to block low jabs and sideswipes and overhead cuts. \"The trick is keeping your balance,\" he said. \"Fighting on the bars isn't like fighting on the ground. You can't just block a blow - you have to stay steady on your feet, so you're ready for the next. Sometimes it's better to take a strike than duck out of the way.\"</p><p>\"Nonsense,\" Kurda snorted. \"Duck all you like, Darren - I don't want to cart you back to Larten on a stretcher!\"</p><p>\"She won't really hurt me, will she?\" I asked, alarmed.</p><p>Vanez laughed. \"Of course not. Kurda's only winding you up. She won't go easy on you - Arra doesn't know how to take things easy - but I'm sure she won't set out to seriously harm you.\" He glanced up at Arra and muttered under his breath, \"At least, I hope she won't!\"</p><p>Chapter SEVENTEEN</p><p>ITOOK MY SHOES OFF and mounted the bars. I spent a minute or two getting used to them, shuffling around, focusing on my balance. It was easy without the staff - vampires have a great sense of balance - but awkward with it. I took a few practice swipes and almost fell off right away.</p><p>\"Short jabs!\" Vanez snapped, darting forward to steady me. \"Broad swings will be the end of you.\"</p><p>I did as Vanez instructed and soon had the hang of it. A couple more minutes hopping from one bar to another, crouching and jumping, and I was ready.</p><p>We met in the middle of the bars and knocked our staffs together in salute. Arra was smiling - she obviously didn't think much of my chances. We nudged away from each other and Vanez clapped his hands to signal the start of the fight.</p><p>Arra attacked immediately and jabbed at my stomach with the end of her staff. As I pulled out of her way, she swept her staff around in a vicious circle and brought it down on top of me - a skull-cracker! I managed to raise my staff in time to divert the blow, but the jolt of the contact ran through the staff and my fingers to the rest of my body, and forced me to my knees. My grasp on the staff slipped, but I caught it before it fell.</p><p>\"Are you out to kill him?\" Kurda shouted angrily.</p><p>\"The bars are no place for little boys who can't protect themselves,\" Arra sneered.</p><p>\"I'm calling an end to this,\" Kurda huffed, striding toward me.</p><p>\"As you wish,\" Arra said, lowering her staff and turning her back on me.</p><p>\"No!\" I grunted, getting to my feet and raising my staff.</p><p>Kurda stopped short. \"Darren, you don't have to -\" he began.</p><p>\"I want to,\" I interrupted. Then, to Arra, \"Come on - I'm ready.\"</p><p>Arra smiled as she faced me, but now it was an admiring smile, not a mocking one. \"The half-vampire has spirit. It's good to know that the young aren't entirely spineless. Now let's see what it takes to drive the spirit out of you.\"</p><p>She attacked again, short, chopping swipes, switching from left to right without warning. I blocked the blows as best I could, although I had to take some on my arms and shoulders. I retreated to the end of the plank, slowly, guarding myself, then leaped out of her way as she took a wide swing at my legs.</p><p>Arra hadn't anticipated the jump and was thrown off balance. I used the moment to launch my first blow of the contest and hit her firmly on her left thigh. It didn't seem to hurt her much, but she hadn't been expecting it and let out a roar of surprise.</p><p>\"A point to Darren!\" Kurda whooped.</p><p>\"We don't score this on points,\" Arra snarled.</p><p>\"You'd better watch yourself, Arra.\" Vanez chuckled, his single eye gleaming. \"I think the boy can beat you. You'll never be able to show your face in the Halls again if a teenage half-vampire bests you on the bars.\"</p><p>\"The night I'm bested by the likes of him is the night you can strap me into a cage in the Hall of Death and drop me on the stakes,\" Arra growled. She was angry now - she didn't like being baited by those on the ground - and when next she faced me, her smile had disappeared.</p><p>I moved cautiously. I knew that one good strike meant nothing. If I grew cocky and dropped my guard, she'd finish me off in no time. As she stepped across to face me, I edged backward. I let her advance a couple of feet, then leaped to another bar. After a few retreating steps, I jumped to another bar, then another.</p><p>I was hoping to frustrate Arra. If I could drag the contest out, she might lose her temper and do something silly. But a vampire's patience is legendary, and Arra was no exception. She trailed me like a cat after a bird, ignoring the jeers of those who'd gathered around the bars to observe the fight, taking her time, letting me play my evasive games, waiting for the right moment to strike.</p><p>Eventually she maneuvered me into a corner and I had to fight. I got in a couple of low blows - hitting her toes and knees like Vanez had suggested - but there was no power in my shots, and she took them without blinking. As I stooped to hit her toes again, she leaped to an adjoining bar and brought the flat of her staff down over my back. I roared with pain and dropped onto my belly. My staff fell to the floor.</p><p>\"Darren!\" Kurda shouted, rushing forward.</p><p>\"Leave him!\" Vanez snapped, holding the General back.</p><p>\"But he's hurt!\"</p><p>\"He'll live. Don't disgrace him in front of all these vampires. Let him fight.\"</p><p>Kurda didn't like it, but he did as Vanez said.</p><p>Arra, meanwhile, had decided I was finished. Rather than strike me with her staff, she eased one of the rounded ends under my belly and tried rolling me off the bar. She was smiling again. I let my body roll, but held on tight to the bar with my hands and feet, so I didn't fall off. I swung all the way around, until I was hanging on upside down, snatched my staff off the ground, and jabbed it between Arra's calves. With a sharp twist, I sent her sprawling. She shrieked, and for a split second I was sure I'd knocked her off and won, but she grabbed for the bar on her way down and held on, as I was doing. Her staff, however, struck the floor and spun away.</p><p>The vampires who'd gathered to watch - there were twenty or thirty around the bars now - clapped loudly as we hauled ourselves back to our feet and eyed each other warily. I lifted my staff and smiled. \"Seems like I have the advantage now,\" I noted cockily.</p><p>\"Not for long,\" Arra said. \"I'm going to rip that staff out of your hands and smash your head in with it!\"</p><p>\"Is that so?\" I grinned. \"Come on then - let's see you try!\"</p><p>Arra spread her hands and closed in on me. I hadn't really expected her to attack without her staff and wasn't sure what to do. I didn't like the idea of striking an unarmed opponent, especially a woman.</p><p>\"You can pick your staff up if you want,\" I offered.</p><p>\"Leaving the bars isn't allowed,\" she replied.</p><p>\"Get someone to bring it to you then.\"</p><p>\"That's not allowed either.\"</p><p>I retreated. \"I don't want to hit you when you have nothing to defend yourself with,\" I said. \"How about I throw away my staff as well and we fight hand to hand?\"</p><p>\"A vampire who abandons his weapon is a fool,\" Arra said. \"If you throw the staff away, I'll ram it down your throat to teach you a lesson when we're through up here on the bars.\"</p><p>\"Okay!\" I snapped irritably. \"Have it your own way.\" I stopped retreating, raised my staff, and laid into her.</p><p>Arra was hunched over - she had a lower center of gravity that way and would be harder to knock off - so I was able to aim at her head. I jabbed at her face with the end of my staff. She avoided the first couple of blows, but I struck her cheek with the third. It didn't draw blood but left a nasty welt.</p><p>Arra was retreating now. She gave ground grudgingly, standing up to my lesser strikes, taking them on her arms and hands, only backing up to avoid the heavier blows. Despite my earlier warning to myself, I became overconfident. I thought I had her where I wanted. Instead of taking my time and finishing her off slowly, I went for the quick kill, and that proved my undoing.</p><p>I flicked the end of my staff toward the side of her head, planning to sting her ear. It was a casual swipe, neither as sharp nor as fast as it needed to be. I connected with her ear, but there was no power in the shot. Before I could draw back for my next, Arra's hands sprang into action.</p><p>Her right hand grasped the end of my staff and held it tight. Her left hand balled up into a fist and smashed into my jaw. She hit me again and I saw stars. As she drew back her fist for a third punch, I reacted automatically and stepped clear of her reach, which was when she gave a quick wrench and ripped my staff away from me.</p><p>\"Now!\" she hooted triumphantly, twirling the staff over her head. \"Now who has the advantage?\"</p><p>\"Take it easy, Arra,\" I said nervously, backing away from her like crazy. \"I offered to give you your staff back, remember?\"</p><p>\"And I refused,\" she said angrily.</p><p>\"Let him have a staff, Arra,\" Kurda said. \"You can't expect him to defend himself with his bare hands. It isn't fair.\"</p><p>\"How about it, boy?\" she asked. \"I'll let you call for a replacement staff if you wish.\" By her tone, I knew she wouldn't think much of me if I did.</p><p>I shook my head. I'd have traded anything I owned for a staff, but I wasn't about to ask for special favors, not when Arra hadn't. \"That's okay,\" I said. \"I'll fight on like I am.\"</p><p>\"Darren!\" Kurda howled. \"Don't be stupid. Call it off if you don't want another staff. You've fought bravely and proved your courage.\"</p><p>\"There would be no shame in quitting now,\" Vanez agreed.</p><p>I stared into Arra's eyes, saw that she expected me to resign, and stopped. \"No,\" I said. \"No quitting. I won't get off these bars till I'm knocked off.\" I started forward, hunched over like Arra had been.</p><p>Arra blinked, surprised, then raised her staff and set about ending the contest. It didn't take long. I blocked her first jab with my left hand, took her second in the belly, ducked out of the way of her third, and slapped away her fourth with my right hand. But I was caught square around the back of my head by her fifth. I dropped to my knees, groggy. There was the sound of rushing air, then the round end of Arra's staff connected cleanly with the left side of my face, and I went crashing to the ground.</p><p>The next thing I knew, I was staring up at the roof, surrounded by concerned vampires. \"Darren?\" Kurda asked, worry in his voice. \"Are you all right?\"</p><p>\"What... happened?\" I wheezed.</p><p>\"She knocked you out,\" he said. \"You've been unconscious for five or six minutes. We were about to send for help.\"</p><p>I sat up, wincing at the pain. \"Why's the room spinning?\" I groaned.</p><p>Vanez laughed and helped me to my feet. \"He'll be fine,\" the games master said. \"A little concussion never killed a vampire. A good day's sleep and he'll be right as night.\"</p><p>\"How much farther is it to Vampire Mountain?\" I asked weakly.</p><p>\"The poor child doesn't know whether he's coming or going!\" Kurda snapped, and started to lead me away.</p><p>\"Wait!\" I shouted, my head clearing a bit. I looked for Arra Sails and spotted her sitting on one of the bars, applying a cream to her bruised cheek. Shaking free of Kurda, I stumbled across to the vampiress and stood as firmly as I could before her.</p><p>\"Yes?\" she asked, eyeing me guardedly.</p><p>I stuck out a hand and said, \"Shake.\"</p><p>Arra stared at the hand, then into my unfocused eyes. \"One good fight doesn't make you a warrior,\" she said.</p><p>\"Shake!\" I repeated angrily.</p><p>\"And if I don't? \"she asked.</p><p>\"I'll get back up on the bars and fight you till you do,\" I growled.</p><p>Arra studied me at length, then nodded and took my hand. \"Power to you, Darren Shan,\" she said gruffly.</p><p>\"Power,\" I repeated weakly, then fainted into her arms and stayed unconscious till I came to in my hammock the next night.</p><p>Chapter EIGHTEEN</p><p>TWO NIGHTS AFTER my encounter with Arra Sails, Mr. Crepsley and me were called before the Vampire Princes. I was still stiff from my fight, and Mr. Crepsley had to help me dress. I groaned as I raised my arms over my head - they were black-and-blue from where I'd taken Arra's blows.</p><p>\"I cannot believe you were foolish enough to challenge Arra Sails,\" Mr. Crepsley tutted. He'd been teasing me about my fight with the vampiress since learning about it, although underneath his mocking front I could tell he was proud of me. \"Even I would hesitate at going one-on-one with her on the bars.\"</p><p>\"Guess that means I'm braver than you.\" I smirked.</p><p>\"Stupidity and bravery are not the same thing,\" he chided me. \"You could have been seriously injured.\"</p><p>\"You sound like Kurda,\" I sulked.</p><p>\"I do not agree with Kurda's views on the righting ways of vampires - he is a pacifist, which runs contrary to our nature - but he is correct when he says that sometimes it is better not to fight. When a situation is hopeless, and there is nothing at stake, only a fool battles on.\"</p>","<p>\"But it wasn't hopeless!\" I exclaimed. \"I almost beat her!\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley smiled. \"You are impossible to talk to. But so are most vampires. It is a sign that you are learning. Now finish dressing and make yourself presentable. We must not keep the Princes waiting.\"</p><p>The Hall of Princes was situated at the highest internal point of Vampire Mountain. There was only one entrance to it, a long, wide tunnel guarded by a host of Mountain Guards. I hadn't been up here before - nobody could use the tunnel unless they had business in the Hall.</p><p>The green-garbed guards watched us every step of the way. You weren't allowed to take weapons into the Hall of Princes, or carry anything that might be used as a weapon. Shoes weren't permitted - too easy to hide a small dagger in the soles - and we were searched from head to foot at three different parts of the tunnel. The guards even ran combs through our hair, in case we had thin wires hidden inside!</p><p>\"Why all the security?\" I whispered to Mr. Crepsley. \"I thought the Princes were respected and obeyed by all vampires.\"</p><p>\"They are,\" he said. \"This is for tradition's sake more than anything else.\"</p><p>At the end of the tunnel we emerged into a huge cavern, in which a strange, white dome stood gleaming. It was like no other building I'd ever seen - the walls pulsed, as though alive, and there were no joints or cracks that I could make out.</p><p>\"What is it? \"I asked.</p><p>\"The Hall of Princes,\" Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>\"What's it made of - rock, marble, iron?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley shrugged. \"Nobody knows.\" He led me to the dome - the only guards on this side of the tunnel were grouped around the doors to the Hall - and told me to place my hands on it.</p><p>\"It's warm!\" I gasped. \"And it throbs! What is it?\"</p><p>\"Long ago, the Hall of Princes was like any other,\" Mr. Crepsley answered in his usual roundabout way. \"Then, one night, Mr. Tiny arrived and said he had gifts for us. This was shortly after the vampaneze had split from the vampires. The 'gifts' were the dome - which his Little People constructed, unseen by any vampires - and the Stone of Blood. The dome and Stone are magical artifacts. They -\"</p><p>One of the guards at the doors hailed us. \"Larten Crepsley! Darren Shan!\" We hurried over. \"You may be admitted now,\" the guard said, and struck the doors four times with the large spear he was carrying. The doors slid open - like electronic doors - and we entered.</p><p>Though no torches burned inside the Hall of Princes, it was as bright as day, far brighter than anywhere else in the mountain. The light originated in the walls of the dome itself, by means unknown to all but Mr. Tiny. Long seats - like pews - ran in circles around the dome. There was a large space at the center, where four wooden thrones stood mounted on a platform. Three of the thrones were occupied by Vampire Princes. Mr. Crepsley had told me that at least one Prince always skipped Council, in case anything happened to the others. Nothing hung from the walls, no paintings, portraits, or flags. There were no statues either. This was a place for business, not pomp or ceremony.</p><p>Most of the seats were filled. Ordinary vampires sat at the rear; the middle sections were reserved for mountain personnel, guards and people like them. Vampire Generals occupied the front seats. Mr. Crepsley and me made our way to the third row of seats from the front and slid in beside Kurda Smahlt, Gavner Purl, and Harkat Mulds, who were waiting for us. I was glad to see the Little Person again, and asked what he'd been up to.</p><p>\"Answering... questions,\" he replied. \"Saying same thing... over and over... and over... again.\"</p><p>\"Did any more of your memory come back?\" I asked.</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"But it's not for want of trying.\" Gavner laughed, leaning forward to squeeze my shoulder. \"We've been practically torturing Harkat with questions, trying to get him to remember. And he hasn't complained once. If I was in his place, I'd have raised hell ages ago. He hasn't even been allowed to sleep!\"</p><p>\"Don't need... much sleep,\" Harkat said shyly.</p><p>\"Recovered from your bout with Arra yet?\" Kurda asked.</p><p>Before I could answer, Gavner piped up. \"I heard about that! What in heaven were you thinking? I'd rather face a pit full of scorpions than hop on the bars with Arra Sails. I saw her make mincemeat of twenty seasoned vampires one night.\"</p><p>\"It seemed like a good idea at the time,\" I said with a grin.</p><p>Gavner had to leave us to discuss something with a bunch of other Generals - vampires were forever debating serious issues in the Hall of Princes - and while we were waiting, Mr. Crepsley explained a little more about the dome.</p><p>\"The dome is magical. There is no way in except through the single set of doors. Nothing can penetrate its walls, no tool, explosive, or acid. It is the toughest material known to man or vampire.\"</p><p>\"Where did it come from?\" I asked.</p><p>\"We do not know. The Little People brought it in covered wagons. It took them months to haul it up, one sheet at a time. We were not allowed to watch as they assembled it. Our finest architects have been over it many times since, but not one can unravel its mysteries.</p><p>\"The doors can only be opened by a Vampire Prince,\" he went on. \"They can open them by laying their palms directly on the panels of the doors, or from their thrones, by pressing their palms down on the armrests.\"</p><p>\"They must be electronic,\" I said. \"The panels 'read' their fingerprints, right?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley shook his head. \"The Hall was built centuries ago, long before electricity was even a thought in the minds of man. It operates by paranormal means, or by a form of technology far advanced of anything we know.</p><p>\"You see the red stone behind the Princes?\" he asked. It was set on a pedestal fifteen feet behind the platform, an oval stone, about twice the size of a football. \"That is the Stone of Blood. That is the key, not only to the dome, but to the longevity of the vampire race itself.\"</p><p>\"Long - what?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Longevity. It means long life.\"</p><p>\"How can a stone have anything to do with a long life?\" I asked, puzzled.</p><p>\"The Stone serves several purposes,\" he said. \"Every vampire, when accepted into the fold, must stand before the Stone and place his hands on it. The Stone looks as smooth as a ball of glass, but is ultra-sharp to the touch. It draws blood, which is absorbed by the Stone - hence its name - linking the vampire to the mental collective of the clan forever.\"</p><p>\"Mental collective?\" I repeated, wishing for the millionth time since I'd met Mr. Crepsley that he'd use simple words.</p><p>\"You know how vampires can mentally search for those they have bonded with?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"Well, using the method of triangulation, we can also search for and find those we have not bonded with, via the Stone.\"</p><p>\"Triangu - what?\" I groaned, exasperated.</p><p>\"Let us say you are a full vampire whose blood has been absorbed by the Stone,\" he said. \"When a vampire gives his blood, he also gives his name, by which the Stone and other vampires will thenceforth recognize him. If I want to search for you after you have been blooded, I merely place my hands on the Stone of Blood and think your name. Within seconds the Stone allows me to pinpoint your exact location anywhere on Earth.\"</p><p>\"You could do this even if I didn't want to be found?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Yes. But pinpointing your location would be no good - by the time I got to where you had been when I made the search, you would have moved on. Hence the need for triangulation, which simply means three people are involved. If I wanted to find you, I could contact someone I was bonded with - Gavner, for instance - and mentally transmit your whereabouts to him. With me guiding him via the Stone of Blood, he could track you down.\"</p><p>I thought that over in silence for a while. It was an ingenious system, but I could see a few drawbacks. \"Can anyone use the Stone of Blood to find a vampire?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Anyone with the ability to search mentally,\" Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>\"Even a human or a vampaneze?\"</p><p>\"Very few humans have minds advanced enough to use the Stone,\" he said, \"but the vampaneze can.\"</p><p>\"Isn't the Stone dangerous then?\" I asked. \"If a vampaneze got his hands on it, couldn't he track every vampire down - at least all the ones he knew the names of - and guide his colleagues to them?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley smiled grimly. \"Your battering at the hands of Arra Sails has not affected your powers of reasoning. You are correct - the Stone of Blood would mean the end of the vampire race if it fell into the wrong hands. The vampaneze would be able to hunt all of us down. They can also find those they do not know the names of - the Stone lets its user search for vampires by location as well as name, so they could scan for every vampire in England or America or wherever, then send out others to track them down. That is why we guard the Stone carefully and never let it leave the safety of the dome.\"</p><p>\"Wouldn't it be simpler just to break it?\" I asked.</p><p>Kurda, who'd been eavesdropping, laughed. \"I put that proposal to the Princes several decades ago,\" he said. \"The Stone could resist normal tools and explosives, the same as the walls of the dome, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to get rid of safely. 'Throw the damn thing down a volcano, I pleaded, 'or toss it in the deepest sea. They wouldn't hear of such a thing.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\" I asked.</p><p>\"There are a number of reasons,\" Mr. Crepsley answered before Kurda could reply. \"First, the Stone can be used to locate vampires who are missing or in trouble, or those who are mad and on the loose. It is healthy to know that we are joined to the clan by more than tradition, that we can always rely on aid if we lead good lives, and punishment if we do not. The Stone keeps us in line.</p><p>\"Second, the Stone of Blood is necessary to operate the doors of the dome. When a vampire becomes a Prince, the Stone is a vital part of the ceremony. He forms a circle around it with two other Princes. They each use a hand to pump blood into him, while laying their other hand on the Stone. Blood flows from the old Princes to the new Prince, then to the Stone, and back again. By the end of the ceremony, the new Prince can control the doors of the Hall. Without the Stone, he would be a Prince in name only.</p><p>\"There is a third reason why we do not destroy the Stone - the Lord of the Vampaneze.\" His face was dark. \"The myth says that the Vampaneze Lord will wipe the vampire race from the face of the Earth when he comes to power, but through the Stone of Blood we might one night rise again.\"</p><p>\"How's that possible?\" I asked.</p><p>\"We do not know,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"But those were the words of Mr. Tiny, and since the power of the Stone is also his, it makes sense to pay heed. Now more than ever, we must protect the Stone. Harkat's message concerning the Vampaneze Lord has struck at the hearts and spirits of many vampires. With the Stone, there is hope. To dispose of it now would be to surrender to fear.\"</p><p>\"Charna's guts!\" Kurda snorted. \"I've no time for those old myths. We should get rid of the Stone, shut down the dome, and build a new Hall of Princes. Apart from anything else, it's one of the main reasons the vampaneze are loath to make a deal with us. They don't want to be hooked up to a magical tool of Mr. Tiny's, and who can blame them? They're afraid of bonding with the Stone - they could never split from the vampire clan if they did, because we'd be able to use the Stone to hunt them down. If we removed the Stone, they might return to us, and then the vampaneze would be no more - there'd be one big family of vampires - and the threat of the Vampaneze Lord would evaporate.\"</p><p>\"Does that mean you will be seeking to destroy the Stone when you are a Prince?\" Mr. Crepsley inquired.</p><p>\"I'll mention the possibility.\" Kurda nodded. \"It's a sensitive issue, and I don't expect the Generals to agree to it, but in time, as negotiations between ourselves and the vampaneze develop, I hope they'll come around to my way of thinking.\"</p><p>\"Did you make this clear when you were seeking election?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>Kurda shifted uncomfortably. \"Well, no, but that's politics. Sometimes you have to hold things back. I didn't lie about it. If anyone had asked me for my views on the Stone, I'd have told them. They just... didn't... ask,\" he finished lamely.</p><p>\"Politics!\" Mr. Crepsley huffed. \"It is a sad day for vampires when our Princes voluntarily ensnare themselves in the despicable webs of politics.\" Sticking his nose in the air, he turned his back on Kurda and stared straight ahead at the platform.</p><p>\"I've upset him,\" Kurda whispered to me.</p><p>\"He's easily upset,\" I said with a grin. Then I asked if I'd have to bond with the Stone of Blood.</p><p>\"Probably not until you become a full vampire,\"</p><p>Kurda said. \"Half-vampires have been allowed to bond with it in the past, but not in the normal run of things.\"</p><p>I was going to ask more about the mysterious Stone of Blood and the dome, but then a serious-looking General banged the floor of the platform with a heavy staff and announced my name, along with Mr. Crepsley's.</p><p>It was time to meet the Princes.</p><p>Chapter NINETEEN</p><p>THE THREE VAMPIRE PRINCES in attendance were Paris Skyle, Mika Ver Leth, and Arrow. (The absent Prince was called Vancha March.)</p><p>Paris Skyle had a long gray beard, flowing white hair, and no right ear, and he was the oldest living vampire, at eight hundred earth years or more. He was worshiped by the others, not only for his immense age and position, but for his exploits when he was younger - according to the legends, Paris Skyle had been everywhere and done everything. A lot of the tales were outrageous - he'd sailed with Columbus to America and introduced vampirism to the New World, fought beside Joan of Arc (a vampire sympathizer, apparently), and provided the inspiration for Bram Stoker's infamous Dracula. But that didn't mean the tales weren't true - vampires were, by their very existence, amazing creatures.</p>","<p>Mika Ver Leth was the youngest Vampire Prince, a ?mere\" two hundred and seventy. He had shiny black hair and piercing eyes, like a raven's, and he dressed all in black. He looked even sterner than Mr. Crepsley - his forehead was creased with wrinkles, as were the sides of his mouth - and I got the feeling he rarely smiled, if at all.</p><p>Arrow was a thickly built bald man, with long tattoos of arrows adorning his arms and the sides of his head. He was a fearsome fighter whose hatred of the vampaneze was legendary. He'd been married to a human before becoming a General, but she had been killed by a vampaneze who'd come to fight Arrow. He returned to the fold, sullen and withdrawn, and trained to be a General. Since then he had devoted himself to his work, to the exclusion of all else.</p><p>All three Princes were burly, muscular men. Even the ancient Paris Skyle looked like he could toss an ox over his shoulder using a single hand.</p><p>\"Greetings, Larten,\" Paris said to Mr. Crepsley, stroking his long gray beard and studying the vampire with warm eyes. \"It is good to see you in the Hall of Princes. I did not think I would look upon your face again.\"</p><p>\"I vowed I would be back,\" Mr. Crepsley replied, bowing before the Prince.</p><p>\"I never doubted it.\" Paris smiled. \"I just did not think I would be alive to welcome you. I have grown long of tooth, old friend. My nights are numbered.\"</p><p>\"You will outlive us all, Paris,\" Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>\"We shall see,\" Paris said with a sigh. He fixed his gaze on me while Mr. Crepsley bowed to the other Princes. When the vampire returned to my side, the old Prince said, \"This must be your assistant - Darren Shan. Gavner Purl has spoken approvingly of him.\"</p><p>\"He is of good blood and strong heart,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"A fine assistant, who will one night make a first-rate vampire.\"</p><p>\"One night indeed!\" Mika Ver Leth snorted, squinting at me in a way I didn't like. \"He's just a boy! This is no time for children to be admitted to our ranks. What possessed you to -\"</p><p>\"Please, Mika,\" Paris Skyle interrupted. \"Let us not speak rashly. All here know the character of Larten Crepsley. We must treat him with the respect he has earned. I do not know why he chose to blood a child, but I am certain he can explain.\"</p><p>\"I just think it's crazy, in this night and age.\" Mika Ver Leth grumbled his way to silence. When he was still, Paris turned to me and smiled.</p><p>\"You must forgive us, Darren, if we seem discourteous. We are unused to children. It has been a long time since any were presented before us.\"</p><p>\"I'm not really a child,\" I muttered. \"I've been a half-vampire for eight years. It's not my fault my body hasn't aged.\"</p><p>\"Precisely!\" Mika Ver Leth snapped. \"It's the fault of the vampire who blooded you. He -\"</p><p>\"Mika!\" Paris snapped. \"This vampire of noble standing and his assistant have come before us in good faith, to seek our approval. Whether we grant it or not, they deserve to be heard politely, not challenged rudely in front of their colleagues.\"</p><p>Mika collected himself, stood, and bowed to us. \"Sorry,\" he said through gritted teeth. \"I spoke out of turn. I will not do so again.\"</p><p>A murmur spread through the Hall. From the whispers, I gathered that it was most unusual for a Prince to apologize to an inferior, especially one who was no longer a General.</p><p>\"Come, Larten,\" Paris said, as chairs were brought forward for us. \"Sit and tell us what you have been up to since last we met.\"</p><p>Once we were seated, Mr. Crepsley ran through his story. He told the Princes of his association with the Cirque Du Freak, the places he'd been, the people he'd met. When he came to the part about Murlough, he asked to speak to the Princes in private. He told them in whispers of the mad vampaneze, and how we'd killed him. They were disturbed by the news.</p><p>\"This is worrisome,\" Paris mused aloud. \"If the vampaneze find out, they could use it as an excuse to start a war!\"</p><p>\"How could they?\" Mr. Crepsley responded. \"I am no longer part of the clan.\"</p><p>\"If they were suitably enraged, they could overlook that,\" Mike Ver Leth said. \"If the rumor of the Vampaneze Lord is true, we must tread very carefully where our blood cousins are concerned.\"</p><p>\"Still,\" Arrow said, contributing to the conversation for the first time, \"I don't think Larten erred. It would be different if he were a General, but as a free agent, he is not bound by our laws. Were I in his position, I'd have done the same thing. He acted discreetly. I don't think we can fault him for that.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Mika agreed. Glancing at me, he added, \"Not for that.\"</p><p>With the matter of Murlough out of the way, we returned to our chairs and raised our voices so that everyone in the Hall could hear.</p><p>\"Now,\" Paris Skyle said, adopting a grave expression. \"It is time we returned to the business of your assistant. We all know that the world has changed vastly these last few centuries. Humans are more protective of one another and their laws are stricter than ever, particularly with regard to their young. That is why we no longer blood children. Even in the past, we blooded few of them. It has been ninety years since we last added a child to our ranks. Tell us, Larten, why you decided to break with recent tradition.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley cleared his throat and locked eyes with the Princes, one after the other, until they settled on Mika. \"I have no valid reason,\" he said calmly, and the Hall erupted into barely contained shouts and muffled, hurried conversations.</p><p>\"There will be quiet in the Hall!\" Paris shouted, and all noise ceased at once. He looked troubled when he faced us. \"Come, Larten, do not play games. You would not blood a boy out of simple whimsy. There must be a reason. Did you kill his parents, perhaps, and decide it was your place to take care of him?\"</p><p>\"His parents are alive,\" Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>\"Both of them?\" Mika snapped.</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"Then they are looking for him?\" Paris asked.</p><p>\"No. We faked his death. They buried him. They think he is dead.\"</p><p>\"That much at least you did right,\" Paris murmured. \"But why blood him in the first place?\" When Mr. Crepsley didn't answer, Paris turned to me and asked, \"Darren? Do you know why he blooded you?\"</p><p>Hoping to bail the vampire out of trouble, I said, \"I found out the truth about him, so maybe part of it was to protect himself - he might have figured that he had to make me his assistant or kill me.\"</p><p>\"That is a reasonable excuse,\" Paris noted.</p><p>\"But not the truth,\" Mr. Crepsley said, and sighed. \"I was never afraid of being exposed by Darren. In fact, the only reason he discovered the truth about me was because I tried to blood a friend of his, a boy his own age.\"</p><p>The Hall erupted into controversy, and it took the barking Princes several minutes to quiet the vampires. When order was finally restored, Paris resumed the questioning, more troubled than ever. \"You tried to blood another boy?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley nodded. \"But his blood was tainted with evil - he would not have made a good vampire.\"</p><p>\"Let me get this straight,\" Mika said angrily. \"You tried blooding one boy, but couldn't; his friend found out, so you blooded him instead?\"</p><p>\"That is about the sum of it,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed. \"I also blooded him in a rush, without revealing the full truth of our ways, which was unpardonable. In my defense I will add that I studied him at great length before blooding him, and was convinced of his honesty and strength of character when I did.\"</p><p>\"What drew you to the first boy - the one with evil blood?\" Paris asked.</p><p>\"He knew who I was. He had seen a portrait of me in an old book, drawn long ago when I was using the name of Vur Horston. He asked to become my assistant.\"</p><p>\"Didn't you explain our ways to him?\" Mika asked. \"Didn't you tell him we don't blood children?\"</p><p>\"I tried, but...\" Mr. Crepsley shook his head miserably. \"It was as though I had no control over myself. I knew it was wrong, but I would have blooded him regardless, if not for his foul blood. I cannot explain why, because I do not understand it.\"</p><p>\"You'll have to come up with a better argument than that,\" Mika warned him.</p><p>\"I cannot,\" Mr. Crepsley said softly, \"because I have none.\"</p><p>There was a polite cough behind us and Gavner Purl stepped forward. \"May I intervene on my friend's behalf?\" he asked.</p><p>\"By all means,\" Paris said. \"We welcome your input, if it can clear things up.\"</p><p>\"I don't know if it can do that,\" Gavner said, \"but I'd like to note that Darren is an extraordinary boy. He made the trek to Vampire Mountain - no small feat for one his age - and fought a bear poisoned with vampaneze blood along the way. I'm sure you have heard of his contest with Arra Sails a few nights ago.\"</p><p>\"We have.\" Paris chuckled.</p><p>\"He is bright and brave, wily and honest. I believe he has the makings of a fine vampire. Given the chance, I think he'll excel. He's young, but younger vampires than him have come through the ranks. You were only two years old when you were blooded, weren't you, sire?\" he asked Paris Skyle.</p><p>\"That's not the point!\" Mika Ver Leth shouted. \"This boy could be the next Khledon Lurt and it wouldn't make a blind bit of difference. Facts are facts - vampires no longer blood children. It will set a dangerous precedent if we let this pass without taking action.\"</p><p>\"Mika is right,\" Arrow said softly. \"The boy's courage and ability are not the issue. Larten acted poorly in blooding the boy, and we must address that.\"</p><p>Paris nodded slowly. \"They speak the truth, Larten. It would be wrong of us to ignore this. You yourself would never have tolerated such a breach of the rules were you in our position.\"</p><p>\"I know,\" Mr. Crepsley said with a sigh. \"I do not seek forgiveness, merely consideration. And I ask that no reprisals be taken against Darren. The fault is mine, and I alone should be punished.\"</p><p>\"I don't know about punishment,\" Mika said uncomfortably. \"I'm not out to make an example of you. Dragging your good name through the muck is the last thing on my mind.\"</p><p>\"None of us wish to do that,\" Arrow agreed. \"But what option have we? He did wrong - we must address that wrong.\"</p><p>\"But we must address it mercifully,\" Paris mused.</p><p>\"I ask for no mercy,\" Mr. Crepsley said stiffly. \"I am not a young vampire who acted out of ignorance. I expect no special treatment. If you decide I am to be executed, I will accept your verdict without complaint. If-\"</p><p>\"They can't kill you because of me!\" I gasped.</p><p>\"If you decide I must be tested,\" he continued, ignoring my outburst, \"I will rise to any challenge you care to set, and die meeting it if I must.\"</p><p>\"There will be no challenge,\" Paris huffed. \"We reserve challenges for those who have not proven themselves in battle. I will say once again - your good standing is not in question.\"</p><p>\"Perhaps...,\" Arrow said hesitantly, then lapsed into silence. A few seconds later, he resumed. \"I think I have it. The talk of challenges gave me an idea. There is a way to resolve this without killing our old friend or soiling his good name.\" Pointing a finger at me, he said coolly, \"Let's set a challenge for the boy.\"</p><p>Chapter TWENTY</p><p>THERE WAS A LONG, thoughtful silence. \"Yes,\" Paris Skyle finally murmured. \"A challenge for the boy.\"</p><p>\"I said I did not want to bring Darren into this!\" Mr. Crepsley objected.</p><p>\"No,\" Mika contradicted him. \"You said you didn't want him to be punished. Well, he won't be - a challenge is not a punishment.\"</p><p>\"It is fair, Larten,\" Paris agreed. \"If the boy proves himself in a test, your decision to blood him will be accepted and no more need be said about it.\"</p><p>\"And the dishonor will be his if he fails,\" Arrow added.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley scratched his long facial scar. \"It is an honest solution,\" he mused, \"but the decision is Darren's, not mine. I will not force a challenge on him.\"</p><p>He turned to me. \"Are you prepared to prove yourself to the clan and clear our names?\"</p><p>I fidgeted uneasily on my chair. \"Um... what sort of a challenge are we talking about exactly?\" I asked.</p><p>\"A good question,\" Paris said. \"It would be unfair to pit him in battle against one of our warriors - a half-vampire is no match for a General.\"</p><p>\"And a quest would take too long,\" Arrow said.</p><p>\"That leaves the Trials,\" Mika muttered.</p><p>\"No!\" someone shouted behind us. Looking around, I spotted a red-faced Kurda striding toward the platform. \"I won't stand for this!\" he shouted. \"The boy isn't ready for the Trials. If you insist on testing him, let him wait till he is older.\"</p><p>\"There will be no waiting,\" Mika growled, rising to his feet and taking a few steps toward Kurda. \"We wield the authority here, Kurda Smahlt - you're not a Prince yet, so don't act like one.\"</p><p>Kurda, stopped and glowered at Mika, then dropped to one knee and bowed his head. \"My apologies for speaking out of turn, sire.\"</p><p>\"Apology accepted,\" Mika grunted, returning to his seat.</p><p>\"Have I the permission of the Princes to speak?\" Kurda asked.</p><p>Paris checked with Mika, who shrugged curtly. \"You have,\" he said.</p><p>\"The Trials of Initiation are for experienced vampires,\" Kurda said. \"They were not designed for children. It wouldn't be fair to subject him to them.\"</p>","<p>\"Life for vampires has never been fair,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"But it can be just. I do not enjoy the idea of submitting Darren to the Trials, but it is a just decision and I shall stand by it if he agrees.\"</p><p>\"Excuse me,\" I said, \"but what are the Trials?\"</p><p>Paris smiled kindly at me. \"The Trials of Initiation are tests for vampires who wish to become Generals,\" he explained.</p><p>\"What would I have to do?\"</p><p>\"Perform five acts of physical courage,\" he said. \"The tests are picked at random and are different for each vampire. One involves diving to the bottom of a deep pool and retrieving a dropped medallion. In another you must dodge falling boulders. In another you must cross a hall filled with burning coals. Some tests are more difficult than others, but none are easy. The risk is great, and though most vampires survive, death by misadventure is not unheard-of.\"</p><p>\"You mustn't agree to this, Darren,\" Kurda hissed. \"The Trials are for full vampires. You aren't strong, quick, or experienced enough. You'll be signing your death warrant if you say yes.\"</p><p>\"I disagree,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Darren is capable of passing the Trials. It will not be easy, and he may struggle, but I would not let him step forward if I thought he would be completely out of his depth.\"</p><p>\"Let's vote on it,\" Mika said. \"I say it's the Trials. Arrow?\"</p><p>\"I agree - the Trials.\"</p><p>\"Paris?\"</p><p>The oldest living vampire shook his head uncertainly. \"Kurda has a point when he says the Trials are not for children. I trust your judgment, Larten, but fear your optimism is misplaced.\"</p><p>\"Can you suggest another way?\" Mika snapped.</p><p>\"No, but...\" Paris sighed deeply. \"What do the Generals think?\" he asked, addressing those in the Hall. \"We have heard from Kurda and Mika. Does anyone else have anything to add?\"</p><p>The Generals muttered among themselves, until a familiar figure stood and cleared her throat - Arra Sails. \"I respect Darren Shan,\" she said. \"I have shaken his hand, and those who know me know how much that means to me. I believe Gavner Purl and Larten Crepsley when they say he will be a valuable addition to our ranks.</p><p>\"But I also agree with Mika Ver Leth - Darren must prove himself. All of us have had to endure the Trials. They help make us what we are. As a woman, the odds were stacked against me, but I overcame them and took my place in this Hall as an equal. There must be no exceptions. A vampire who cannot pull his own weight is of no use to us. We have no place for children who need to be wet-nursed and tucked into their coffins at daybreak.</p><p>\"Having said that,\" she concluded, \"I don't think Darren will let us down. I believe he will pass the Trials and prove himself. I have every confidence in him.\" She smiled at me, then glared at Kurda. \"And those who say otherwise - those who'd wrap him in blankets - should not be heeded. To deny Darren the right of Trials would be to shame him.\"</p><p>\"Noble words,\" Kurda sneered. \"Will you repeat them at his funeral?\"</p><p>\"Better to die with pride than live in shame,\" Arra retorted.</p><p>Kurda cursed quietly to himself. \"How about it, Darren?\" he asked. \"Will you face death just to prove yourself to these fools?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said, and saw a pained look cross Mr. Crepsley's face. \"But I'll face death to prove myself to me,\" I added. When the red-cloaked vampire heard that, he beamed proudly and raised a clenched fist in salute.</p><p>\"Let us put it to the Hall,\" Paris said. \"How many think Darren should undertake the Trials of Initiation?\" Every arm went up. Kurda turned aside in disgust. \"Darren? You are willing to proceed?\"</p><p>I looked up at Mr. Crepsley and made a sign for him to bend down. In a whisper, I asked him what would happen if I said no. \"You would be disgraced and sent from Vampire Mountain in shame,\" he said solemnly.</p><p>\"Would you be shamed, too?\" I asked, knowing how much his good name meant to him.</p><p>He sighed. \"In the eyes of the Princes I would not be, but in my own eyes I would. Having chosen and blooded you, I feel any shame of yours would also be mine.\"</p><p>I gave that careful consideration. I'd learned a lot about Mr. Crepsley, how he thought and lived, during the eight years I'd served as his assistant. \"You couldn't bear such shame, could you?\" I asked.</p><p>His expression softened. \"No,\" he said quietly.</p><p>\"You'd go and chase an early death. Hunt wild animals and fight vampaneze, and push yourself until one of them killed you?\"</p><p>\"Something along those lines,\" he agreed with a quick nod.</p><p>I couldn't let that happen. Six years ago, when we'd gone after Murlough, the mad vampaneze had kidnapped Evra, and Mr. Crepsley had offered to trade his life for the snake-boy's. He'd have done the same for me if I'd fallen into the killer's hands. I didn't like the sound of these Trials, but if undertaking them meant Mr. Crepsley could carry on without shame, I owed it to him to place myself in the firing line.</p><p>Facing the Princes, I stood up straight and said solidly, \"I agree to the Trials.\"</p><p>\"Then it is decided,\" Paris Skyle said, smiling approvingly. \"Return tomorrow and we shall draw the first Trial. You may leave now and rest.\"</p><p>That was the end of our meeting. I left the Hall with Gavner, Harkat, and Kurda. Mr. Crepsley stayed to discuss business with the Princes - I think it had to do with Mr. Tiny, Harkat's message, and the dead vampaneze and vampire we'd found on our way here.</p><p>\"I'm glad... to leave at... last,\" Harkat said as we made our way back to the Halls. \"I was... growing bored of... same old... scenery.\"</p><p>I smiled, then glanced at Gavner worriedly. \"How tough are these Trials?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Very,\" he sighed.</p><p>\"Try tough as the walls of the Hall of Princes,\" Kurda growled.</p><p>\"They're not that difficult,\" Gavner said. \"Don't exaggerate the dangers, Kurda - you'll frighten him.\"</p><p>\"That's the last thing I want to do,\" Kurda said, smiling encouragingly at me. \"But the Trials are meant for fully grown vampires. I spent six years preparing for them, like most vampires do, yet I only barely scraped through.\"</p><p>\"Darren will be okay,\" Gavner insisted, though the doubt in his voice was only barely concealed.</p><p>\"Besides,\" I said, trying to cheer Kurda up, \"I can always drop out if I get in over my head.\"</p><p>Kurda stared hard at me. \"Weren't you listening? Didn't you understand?\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Nobody walks away from the Trials,\" Gavner said. \"You might fail, but you can't quit - the Generals won't let you.\"</p><p>\"So I'll fail.\" I shrugged. \"I'll throw in the towel if things get hairy - pretend I've got a twisted ankle or something.\"</p><p>\"He doesn't understand!\" Gavner groaned. \"We should have explained it fully before we let him agree.</p><p>He's given his word now, so there's no going back. Black blood of Harnon Oan!\"</p><p>\"What don't I understand?\" I asked, confused.</p><p>\"In the Trials, failure entails one fate only - death!\" Kurda told me grimly. I stared at him wordlessly. \"Most who fail, die in the attempt. But should you fail and not die, you will be taken to the Hall of Death, strapped into a cage, hoisted above the pit, and -\" he gulped, averted his eyes, and finished in a terrible whisper, \"dropped on the stakes until you are dead!\"</p>"]},{"title":"Trials of Death","pages":["<p>PROLOGUE</p><p>IF PEOPLE ever tell you vampires aren't real - don't believe them! The world's full of vampires. Not evil, shape-changing, cross-fearing creatures like in the legends, but honorable, long-living, extrastrong beings who need to drink blood to survive. They interfere as little as possible in the affairs of humans and never kill those they drink from.</p><p>Hidden away in some snowy, barely accessible corner of the world stands Vampire Mountain, where vampires meet every twelve years. The Council (as they call it) is controlled by the Vampire Princes - who are obeyed by all vampires - and most of those in attendance are Vampire Generals, whose job is to govern the walking undead.</p><p>In order to present me to the Princes, Mr. Crepsley had dragged me along to Vampire Mountain and the Council. Mr. Crepsley's a vampire. I'm his assistant, a half-vampire - my name's Darren Shan.</p><p>It was a long, hard journey. We traveled with a friend of ours, Gavner Purl, four wolves, and two Little People, strange creatures who work for a mysterious master by the name of Mr. Tiny. One of the Little People was killed on the way by a mad bear that had drunk the blood of a dead vampaneze (they're like vampires, except they have purple skin and red eyes, nails, and hair - and they always kill when they feed). The other then spoke - the first time ever that a Little Person had communicated with anyone - and told us his name was Harkat Mulds. He also delivered a chilling message from Mr. Tiny: a Vampaneze Lord would come into power soon and lead the purple-skinned killers into war against the vampires - and win!</p><p>Finally we arrived at Vampire Mountain, where the vampires lived in a network of tunnels and large caves. There I made friends with a bunch of vampires, including Seba Nile, who'd been Mr. Crepsley's teacher when he was younger; Arra Sails, one of the few female vampires; Vanez Blane, a one-eyed games master; and Kurda Smahlt, a General who was going to become a Prince soon.</p><p>The Princes and most of the Generals weren't impressed with me. They said I was too young to be a vampire and criticized Mr. Crepsley for blooding me. To prove myself worthy of being a half-vampire, I had to undertake the Trials of Initiation, a series of tough tests usually reserved for budding Generals. When I was making up my mind to accept the challenge, they told me that if I passed, I'd be accepted into the vampire ranks. What they neglected to tell me until afterward (when it was too late to back out) was that if I failed - I'd be killed!</p><p>Chapter ONE</p><p>THE HUGE CAVERN known as the Hall of Khledon Lurt was almost deserted. Except for those sitting at my table - Gavner, Kurda, and Harkat - there was only one other vampire present, a guard who sat by himself and sipped from a mug of beer, whistling tunelessly.</p><p>About four hours had passed since I learned I was going to be judged in the Trials of Initiation. I still didn't know very much about the Trials, but from the gloomy faces of my companions, and by what had been said in the Hall of Princes, I figured my chances of emerging victorious were, at best, slim.</p><p>While Kurda and Gavner muttered on about my Trials, I studied Harkat, who I hadn't seen much of recently (he'd been cooped up in the Hall of Princes, answering questions). He was dressed in his traditional blue robes, although he now wore his hood down, no longer bothering to hide his grey, scarred, stitched-together face. Harkat didn't have a nose, and his ears were sewn underneath the skin of his skull. He had a pair of large, round green eyes, set near the top of his head. His mouth was jagged and full of sharp teeth. Normal air was poisonous to him - ten or twelve hours of it would kill him - so he wore a special mask that kept him alive. He moved it down over his chin when he was talking or eating and back up to cover his mouth when he wasn't. Harkat had once been human but had died and come back in this body, after striking a deal with Mr. Tiny. He couldn't remember who he'd been or what sort of a deal he'd struck.</p><p>Harkat had carried a message to the Princes from Mr. Tiny, saying that the night of the Vampaneze Lord was coming. The Vampaneze Lord was a mythical figure whose arrival would supposedly signal the start of a war between the vampires and vampaneze, which - according to Mr. Tiny - the vampaneze would win, wiping out the vampire forces in the process.</p><p>Catching my eye, Harkat lowered his mask and said, \"Have you... seen much of... the Halls?\"</p><p>\"A little of them,\" I replied.</p><p>\"You must... take me... on a tour.\"</p><p>\"Darren won't have much time for tours,\" Kurda sighed miserably. \"Not with the Trials to prepare for.\"</p><p>\"Tell me more about these Trials,\" I said.</p><p>\"The Trials are part of our vampiric heritage, going back as long as any vampire can remember,\" Gavner told me. Gavner Purl was a Vampire General. He was very burly, with short brown hair, and he had a scarred, beaten face. Mr. Crepsley teased him a lot about his heavy breathing and snoring. \"In the old nights they were held at every Council,\" Gavner continued, \"and every vampire had to endure them, even if they'd passed a dozen times already.</p><p>\"About a thousand years ago, the Trials were restructured. This was about the time that the Generals came into being. Before that, there were just Princes and ordinary vampires. Under the new terms, only those who wished to be Generals needed to undertake the Trials. A lot of ordinary vampires take the Trials even if they don't want to be a General - a vampire usually has to pass the Trials of Initiation to earn the respect of his peers - but they aren't required to.\"</p><p>\"I don't understand,\" I said. \"I thought if you passed the Trials, you automatically became a General.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Kurda answered ahead of Gavner, running a hand through his blond hair. Kurda Smahlt wasn't as muscular as most vampires - he believed in brains over brawn - and he had less scar tissue than most, although he had three small red permanent scratches on his left cheek, marks of the vampaneze. (Kurda's dream was to reunite the vampires and vampaneze, and he'd spent many decades discussing peace treaties with the murderous outcasts.) \"The Trials are only the first test for would-be Generals. There are other tests of strength, endurance, and wisdom, which come later. Passing the Trials just means you're a vampire of good standing.\"</p><p>Good standing was a phrase I'd heard many times. Respect and honor were extremely important to vampires. If you were a vampire of good standing, it meant you were respected by your colleagues. \"What happens in the Trials?\" I asked. \"There are many different tests,\" Gavner said, taking over again from Kurda. \"You have to complete five of them. They'll be picked at random, one at a time. The challenges range from fighting wild boars to climbing perilous mountains to crawling through a pit filled with snakes.\"</p><p>\"Snakes?\" I asked, alarmed. My best friend at the Cirque Du Freak - Evra Von - kept a huge snake, which I'd grown accustomed to but never learned to like. Snakes gave me the creeps.</p><p>\"There won't be any snakes in Darren's Trials,\" Kurda said. \"Our last snake keeper died nine years ago and hasn't been replaced. We still have a few snakes but not enough to fill a tub, never mind a pit.\"</p><p>\"The Trials take place one night after another,\" Gavner said. \"A day's rest is all you're allowed in between. So you have to be especially careful at the start - if you get injured early on, you won't have much time to recover.\"</p><p>\"Actually, he might get lucky there,\" Kurda mused. \"The Festival of the Undead is almost upon us.\"</p><p>\"What's that?\" I asked.</p><p>\"We celebrate with a huge feast when every vampire who's coming to Council has arrived,\" Kurda explained. \"We used the Stone of Blood to search for latecomers a couple of nights ago, and only three more are on their way. When the last arrives, the Festival starts, and no official business may take place for three nights and days.\"</p><p>\"That's right,\" Gavner said. \"If the Festival starts during your Trials, you'll have a three-night break. That would be a great bonus.\"</p><p>\"If the latecomers arrive in time,\" Kurda noted gloomily.</p><p>Kurda seemed to think I didn't stand a chance in the Trials. \"Why are you so sure I'll fail?\" I asked.</p><p>\"It's not that I think poorly of you,\" Kurda said. \"You're just too young and inexperienced. Apart from the fact that you're physically unprepared, you haven't had time to assess the different tasks and practice for them. You're being thrown in at the deep end, and it isn't fair.\"</p><p>\"Still whining about fairness?\" someone commented behind us - Mr. Crepsley. Seba Nile, the quartermaster of Vampire Mountain, was with him. The pair sat and greeted us with silent nods.</p><p>\"You were very quick to agree to the Trials, Larten,\" Kurda said disapprovingly. \"Don't you think you should have explained the rules to Darren more thoroughly? He didn't even know that failure to complete the Trials means certain death!\"</p><p>\"Is that true?\" Mr. Crepsley asked me.</p><p>I nodded. \"I thought I could quit if things weren't working out.\"</p><p>\"Ah, I should have made it clearer. My apologies.\"</p><p>\"A little late for those now.\" Kurda sniffed.</p><p>\"All the same,\" Mr. Crepsley said, \"I stand by my decision. It was a delicate situation. I did wrong to blood Darren - there was no hiding from that. It is important for both our sakes that one of us clears our names. If I had the choice, I would face the challenge, but the Princes elected Darren. Their word, as far as I am concerned, is law.\"</p><p>\"Besides,\" Seba Nile added, \"all is far from lost. When I heard the news, I hurried to the Hall of Princes and used the old and almost forgotten Period of Preparation clause.\"</p><p>\"The what?\" Gavner asked.</p><p>\"Before the time of the Generals,\" Seba explained, \"vampires did not spend years preparing for the Trials. They would draw a Trial at random - as they do now - but rather than tackle it immediately, they had a night and a day to prepare. This was to give them time to practice. Many chose to ignore the Period of Preparation - usually those who had undertaken the Trials before - but there was no dishonor in taking advantage of it.\"</p><p>\"I never heard of that rule,\" Gavner said.</p><p>\"I did,\" Kurda noted, \"but I'd never have thought of it. Does it still apply? It hasn't been used in more than a thousand years.\"</p><p>\"Just because it is unfashionable does not mean it is invalid,\" Seba chuckled. \"The Period of Preparation was never formally abolished. Given that Darren is a special case, I went to the Princes and asked that he be allowed to take advantage of it. Mika objected, of course - that vampire was born to object - but Paris talked him into it.\"</p><p>\"So Darren has twenty-four hours to prepare for each Trial,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"And twenty-four hours to rest afterwards - which adds up to a forty-eight-hour break between each test.\"</p><p>\"That is good news,\" Gavner agreed, brightening up.</p><p>\"There is more,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"We also persuaded the Princes to rule out some of the more difficult Trials, those which are clearly beyond Darren's ability.\"</p><p>\"I thought you said you weren't going to ask for favors,\" Gavner noted with a grin.</p><p>\"And I did not.\" Mr. Crepsley replied. \"I merely asked that the Princes use their common sense. It would be illogical to ask a blind man to paint, or a mute man to sing. So it would be senseless to expect a half-vampire to compete on even terms with a full-vampire. Many of the Trials remain, but those which are clearly impossible for one in Darren's position have been eliminated.\"</p><p>\"I still say it's unfair,\" Kurda complained. He faced the ancient Seba Nile. \"Are there any other old laws we could use? Anything about children not being allowed to compete, or that they can't be killed if they fail?\"</p><p>\"None that I am aware of,\" Seba said. \"The only vampires who cannot be killed for failing the Trials of Initiation are the Princes. All others are judged equally.\"</p><p>\"Why would Princes be taking the Trials?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Long ago they had to participate in the Trials at every Council, like everybody else,\" Seba said. \"Some still undertake them from time to time, if they feel they need to prove themselves. However, it is forbidden for a vampire to kill a Prince, so if a Prince fails and does not die during the Trial, nobody can execute him.\"</p><p>\"What happens in cases like that?\" I asked.</p><p>\"There have not been many,\" Seba said. \"Of the few that I know of, the Princes elected to leave Vampire Mountain and die in the wilds. Only one - Fredor Morsh - resumed his place in the Hall of Princes. That was when the vampaneze broke away, when we needed all of our leaders. Once the crisis had passed, he left to meet his fate.\"</p><p>\"Come,\" Mr. Crepsley said, rising and yawning. \"I am tired. It is time to turn in for the day.\"</p><p>\"I don't think I'll be able to sleep,\" I said.</p><p>\"You must,\" he grunted. \"Rest is vital if you are going to complete the Trials. You will need to be fully alert, with all your wits about you.\"</p><p>\"OK,\" I sighed, joining him. Harkat stood too. \"See you all tomorrow,\" I said to the other vampires, and they nodded gloomily in reply.</p><p>Back in my cell, I made myself as comfortable as possible in my hammock - most vampires slept in coffins, but I couldn't stand them - while Harkat climbed into his. It took a long time to drift off, but finally I did, and though I didn't manage a full day's sleep, I was reasonably clear-headed when night rolled around, and I had to report to the Hall of Princes to learn about my first deathly Trial.</p><p>Chapter TWO</p><p>ARRA SAILS was waiting for Mr. Crepsley and me outside the Hall of Princes. Arra was one of the rare female vampires at Vampire Mountain. She was a fierce fighter, the equal - or better - of most males. We'd fought a contest earlier during my stay, and I'd won her hard-to-earn respect.</p>","<p>\"How are you?\" she asked, shaking my hand.</p><p>\"Pretty good,\" I said.</p><p>\"Nervous?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"I was too, when facing my Trials,\" she said with a smile. \"Only a fool goes into them without feeling anxious. The important thing is not to panic.\"</p><p>\"I'll try not to.\"</p><p>Arra cleared her throat. \"I hope you don't hold what I said in the Hall of Princes against me.\" Arra had urged the Princes to make me undertake the Trials. \"I don't believe in going easy on vampires, even if they're children. Ours is a hard life, not suited to the weak. As I said in the Hall, I think you'll pass the Trials, but if you don't, I won't step in to plead for your life.\"</p><p>\"I understand,\" I said.</p><p>\"We're still friends?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"If you need help preparing, call on me,\" she said. \"I have been through the Trials three times, to prove to myself more than anyone else that I am a worthy vampire. There is very little that I don't know about them.\"</p><p>\"We will bear that in mind,\" Mr. Crepsley said, bowing to her.</p><p>\"Courteous as ever, Larten,\" Arra noted. \"And as handsome too.\"</p><p>I nearly laughed out loud. Mr. Crepsley - handsome? I'd seen more appealing creatures in the monkey cages in zoos! But Mr. Crepsley took the compliment in stride, as though he were used to such flattery, and bowed again.</p><p>\"And you are as beautiful as ever,\" he said.</p><p>\"I know.\" She grinned and left. Mr. Crepsley watched her intently as she walked away, a faraway look on his normally solemn face. When he caught me smirking, he scowled.</p><p>\"What are you grinning about?\" he snapped.</p><p>\"Nothing,\" I said innocently, then added slyly, \"an old girlfriend?\"</p><p>\"If you must know,\" he said stiffly, \"Arra was once my mate.\"</p><p>I blinked. \"You mean she was your wife?\"</p><p>\"In a manner of speaking.\"</p><p>I stared, slack-jawed, at the vampire. \"You never told me you were married!\"</p><p>\"I am not - anymore - but I used to be.\"</p><p>\"What happened - did you get a divorce?\"</p><p>He shook his head. \"Vampires neither marry nor divorce as humans do. We make temporary mating commitments instead.\"</p><p>I frowned. \"What?\"</p><p>\"If two vampires wish to mate,\" he explained, \"they agree to share their lives for a set amount of time, usually five or ten years. At the end of that time, they can agree to another five or ten years, or separate. Our relationships are not like those of humans. Since we cannot have children, and live such a long time, very few vampires stay mated for their whole lives.\"</p><p>\"That sounds bizarre.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley shrugged. \"It is the vampire way.\"</p><p>I thought it over. \"Do you still have feelings for Arra?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I admire and respect her,\" he answered.</p><p>\"That's not what I mean. Do you love her?\"</p><p>\"Oh, look,\" he said quickly, reddening around his throat, \"it is time to present ourselves to the Princes. Hurry - we must not be late.\" And he took off quickly, as though to avoid more personal questions.</p><p>Vanez Blane greeted us inside the Hall of Princes. Vanez was a games master, responsible for maintaining the three gaming Halls and watching over the contestants. He only had one eye, and from the left-hand side he looked awful. But if you saw him from the front or right-hand side, you could tell at a glance that he was a kind, friendly vampire.</p><p>\"How do you feel?\" he asked. \"Ready for the Trials?\"</p><p>\"Just about,\" I replied.</p><p>He took me aside and spoke quietly. \"You can say no if you want, but I've discussed it with the Princes, and they won't object if you ask me to be your Trials tutor. That means I'd tell you about the challenges and help you prepare for them. I'd be like a second in a duel, or a trainer in a boxing match.\"</p><p>\"Sounds good to me,\" I said.</p><p>\"You don't mind, Larten?\" he asked Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>\"Not at all,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"I had planned to be Darren's tutor, but you are much better suited to the job. Are you sure it is not an inconvenience?\"</p><p>\"Of course it isn't,\" Vanez said firmly.</p><p>\"Then it is agreed.\" We all shook hands and smiled at one another.</p><p>\"It feels strange being the center of so much attention,\" I said. \"So many people are going out of their way to help me. Are you like this with all newcomers?\"</p><p>\"Most of the time - yes,\" Vanez said. \"Vampires look out for each other. We have to - everybody else in the world hates or fears us. A vampire can always depend on help from his own.\" He winked and added, \"Even that cowardly scoundrel Kurda Smahlt.\"</p><p>Vanez didn't really think Kurda was a cowardly scoundrel - he just liked to tease the soon-to-be Prince - but many vampires in the mountain did. Kurda didn't like fighting or war and believed in making peace with the vampaneze. To a lot of vampires, that was unthinkable.</p><p>A guard called my name, and I stepped forward, past the circular benches to the platform where the thrones of the Princes were. Vanez stood just behind me, while Mr. Crepsley stayed in his seat - only Trials tutors were allowed to accompany contestants to the platform.</p><p>Paris Skyle, a white-haired, grey-bearded Prince - he was also the oldest living vampire - asked if I was willing to accept whatever Trial came my way. I said I was. He announced to the hall in general that the Period of Preparation would be used, and that some Trials had been withdrawn, because of my size and youth. He asked if anyone objected. Mika Ver Leth - who'd suggested the Trials - looked unhappy about the allowances and picked irritably at the folds of his black shirt but said nothing. \"Very well,\" Paris declared. \"We shall draw the first Trial.\"</p><p>A bag of numbered stones was brought forward by a green-uniformed guard. I'd been told that there were seventeen stones in it, each with its own number. Each number corresponded to a Trial, and the one I picked would be the Trial I'd have to face.</p><p>The guard shook the bag and asked if anyone wanted to examine the stones. One of the Generals raised a hand. This was common practice - the stones were always examined - so I didn't worry about it, just focused on the floor and tried to stop the nervous rumblings of my belly.</p><p>When the stones had been checked and approved, the guard shook them up once more, then held the bag out to me. Closing my eyes, I reached in, grabbed the first stone I touched, and drew it out. \"Number eleven,\" the guard shouted. \"The Aquatic Maze.\"</p><p>The vampires in the Hall mumbled softly among themselves.</p><p>\"Is that good or bad?\" I asked Vanez while the stone was taken up for the Princes to verify.</p><p>\"It depends,\" he said. \"Can you swim?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"Then it's as good a first Trial as any. Things could have been worse.\"</p><p>Once the stone had been checked and put aside so that it couldn't be drawn again, Paris told me that I would be expected to report for the Trial at dusk tomorrow. He wished me luck - he said business would keep him away, though one of the other Princes would be present - then dismissed me. Leaving the Hall, I hurried away with Vanez and Mr. Crepsley to prepare for my first test and brush with death.</p><p>Chapter THREE</p><p>THE AQUATIC MAZE was man-made, built with a low ceiling and watertight walls. There were four doors in and out of it, one in each of its four external walls. From the center where I would be left, it usually took five or six minutes to find your way out, if you didn't get lost.</p><p>But in the Trial, you had to drag around a heavy rock - half your weight - which slowed you down. With the rock, eight or nine minutes was good going.</p><p>In addition to the rock, there was the water to deal with. As soon as the Trial began, the maze started to fill with water, which was pumped in through hoses from underground streams. The water slowed you down even more, and finding your way through the maze usually took about fifteen minutes. If it took longer, you were in serious trouble - because the maze filled to the top in seventeen minutes exactly.</p><p>\"It's important not to panic,\" Vanez said. We were down in one of the practice mazes, a smaller version of the Aquatic Maze. The route wasn't the same - the walls of the Aquatic Maze could be moved around, so the maze was different each time - but it served as a good learning experience. \"Most who fail in the maze do so because they panic,\" he went on. \"It can be frightening when the water rises and the going gets slower and tougher. You have to fight that fear and concentrate on the route. If you let the water distract you, you'll lose your way - and then you're finished.\"</p><p>We spent the early part of the night walking through the maze, over and over, Vanez teaching me how to make a map inside my head. \"Each wall of the maze looks the same,\" he said, \"but they aren't. There are identifying marks - a discolored stone, a jagged piece of floor, a crack. You must note these small differences and build your map from them. That way, if you find yourself in a passage where you've already been, you'll recognize it and can immediately start looking for a new way out, wasting no time.\"</p><p>I spent hours learning how to make mental maps of the maze. It was a lot harder than it sounds. The first few passages were easy to remember - a chipped stone in the top left corner of one, a moss-covered stone in the floor of the next, a bumpy stone in the ceiling of the one after that - but the farther I went, the more I had to remember, and the more confusing it became. I had to find something new in every corridor, because if I used a mark that was similar to one I'd committed to memory already, I'd get the two confused and end up chasing my tail.</p><p>\"You're not concentrating!\" Vanez snapped when I came to a standstill for the seventh or eighth time.</p><p>\"I'm trying,\" I grumbled, \"but it's hard.\"</p><p>\"Trying isn't good enough,\" he barked. \"You have to tune out all other thoughts. Forget the Trials and the water and what will happen if you fail. Forget about dinner and breakfast and whatever else is distracting you. Think only about the maze. It must fill your thoughts completely, or you're doomed.\"</p><p>It wasn't easy, but I gave it my best shot, and within an hour I had improved considerably. Vanez was right - cutting off all other trains of thought was the solution. It was boring, wandering through a maze for hours on end, but that boredom was what I had to learn to appreciate. In the Aquatic Maze, excitement could confuse and kill me.</p><p>Once my map-making skills were good enough, Vanez wrapped a long rope around my waist and attached a rock to the other end. \"This rock is only a quarter of your weight,\" he said. \"We'll try you with a heavier rock later, but I don't want to tire you out too much ahead of the Trial. We'll get you accustomed to this one first, move up to a rock that's a third your weight, then try you on the real thing for a short time, to give you a taste of how it feels.\"</p><p>The rock wasn't especially heavy - as a half-vampire, I was much stronger than a human - but it was an annoyance. Along with slowing me down, it also had a bad habit of catching on corners or in cracks, which meant I had to stop and free it. \"It's important to stop the instant you feel it snagging,\" Vanez said. \"Your natural instinct will be to tug on the rope and free it quickly, but more often than not that worsens the situation, and you wind up taking even longer to fix it. Seconds are vital in the maze. It's better to act methodically and lose four or five seconds freeing yourself than to act hastily and lose ten or twenty.\"</p><p>There were ways to stop the rock and rope from snagging so much. When I came to corners or bends, I had to seize the rope and pull the rock in close to me - that way it was less likely to get stuck. And it was helpful to give the rope a shake every few seconds - that kept it loose. \"But you have to do these things automatically,\" Vanez said. \"You must do them without pausing to think. Your brain should be fully occupied with mapping the maze. Everything else must be done by instinct.\"</p><p>\"It's useless,\" I groaned, sinking to the floor. \"It'd take months to get ready for this. I don't have a hope in hell.\"</p><p>\"Of course you do!\" Vanez roared. Squatting beside me, he poked me in the ribs. \"Feel that?\" he asked, jabbing a sharp finger into the soft flesh of my belly.</p><p>\"Ow!\" I slapped his hand away. \"Quit it!\"</p><p>\"It's sharp?\" he asked, jabbing me again. \"It hurts?\"</p><p>\"Yes!\"</p><p>He grunted, jabbed me one more time, then stood. \"Imagine how much sharper the stakes in the Hall of Death are,\" he said.</p><p>Sighing miserably, I hauled myself to my feet and wiped sweat from my brow. Picking up the rope, I gave it a shake, then started back through the maze, dragging the rock and mapping out the walls, as Vanez had taught me.</p><p>Finally we stopped for a meal and met up with Mr. Crepsley and Harkat in the Hall of Khledon Lurt. I wasn't hungry - I felt too nervous to eat, but Vanez insisted: he said I'd need every last bit of energy when it came to the Trial.</p><p>\"How is he doing?\" Mr. Crepsley asked. He'd wanted to watch me train, but Vanez had told him he'd be in the way.</p><p>\"Remarkably well,\" Vanez said, chewing on the bones of a skewered rat. \"To be honest, though I put on a brave face when the Trial was picked, I thought he'd be - excuse the pun - out of his depth. The Aquatic Maze isn't one of the more brutal Trials, but it's one you need a lot of time to prepare for. But he's a quick learner. We still have a lot to fit in - we haven't tried him in water yet - but I'm a lot more hopeful now than I was a few hours ago.\"</p><p>Harkat had brought Madam Octa - Mr. Crepsley's spider - to the Hall with him and was feeding her bread crumbs soaked in bat broth. He'd agreed to take care of her while I was concentrating on my Trials. Moving away from the vampires, I struck up a conversation with the Little Person. \"Managing her OK?\" I asked.</p>","<p>\"Yes. She is... easy to... take care of.\"</p><p>\"Just don't let her out of her cage,\" I warned. \"She looks cute, but her bite is lethal.\"</p><p>\"I know. I have... often watched... you and her... when you... were onstage... at the Cirque... Du Freak.\"</p><p>Harkat's speech was improving - he slurred his words a lot less now - but he still had to take long pauses for breath in the middle of sentences.</p><p>\"Do you think... you will... be ready... for the Trial?\" he asked.</p><p>I shrugged. \"Right now, the Trial's the last thing on my mind - I'm not even sure I'm going to get through the training! Vanez is working me hard. I suppose he has to, but I feel exhausted. I could slide under the table and sleep for a week.\"</p><p>\"I have been... listening to... vampires talk,\" Harkat said. \"Many are... betting on you.\"</p><p>\"Oh?\" I sat up, taking an interest. \"What odds are they giving me?\"</p><p>\"They do not... have actual... odds. They bet... clothes and... pieces of... jewelry. Most vampires... are betting... against you. Kurda and Gavner... and Arra... are accepting... most of the... bets. They... believe in you.\"</p><p>\"That's good to hear.\" I smiled. \"What about Mr. Crepsley?\"</p><p>Harkat shook his head. \"He said... he does not... bet. Especially not... on children.\"</p><p>\"That's the sort of thing the dry old buzzard would say,\" I huffed, trying not to sound disappointed.</p><p>\"But I... heard him talking... to Seba Nile,\" Harkat added. \"He said... that if you... failed, he would... eat his cape.\"</p><p>I laughed, delighted.</p><p>\"What are you two talking about?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"Nothing,\" I said, grinning up at him.</p><p>When we'd finished eating, Vanez and I headed back to the maze, where we practiced with heavier rocks and in the water. The next few hours were some of the most arduous of my life, and by the time he called it a night and sent me to my cell to rest, I was so tired that I collapsed halfway there and had to be carted back to my hammock by a couple of sympathetic guards.</p><p>Chapter FOUR</p><p>I WAS SO STIFF when I woke that I thought I wouldn't be able to make it to the maze, let alone find my way out of it! But after a couple of minutes of walking around, I worked off the stiffness and felt as fit as ever. I realized Vanez had pushed me exactly the right amount and made a note not to doubt his tactics in the future.</p><p>I was hungry, but Vanez had told me not to eat anything when I woke - if things were tight, a few extra pounds could mean the difference between living and dying.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley and Vanez came for me when it was time. Both wore their best clothes, Mr. Crepsley dazzling in bright red robes, Vanez less flamboyant in a dull brown tunic and trousers.</p><p>\"Ready?\" Vanez asked. I nodded. \"Hungry?\"</p><p>\"Starving!\"</p><p>\"Good.\" He smiled. \"I'll treat you to the finest meal of your life after the Trial. Think about that if you get into trouble - it helps to have something to look forward to.\"</p><p>We wound our way down through the torch-lit tunnels to the Aquatic Maze, Vanez walking in front of me, Mr. Crepsley and Harkat just behind. Vanez carried a purple flag, the sign that he was escorting a vampire to a Trial. Most of the vampires we passed made a strange gesture when they saw me coming: they put the tip of their right-hand middle finger to their forehead, placed the tips of the fingers on either side of it on their eyelids, and spread their thumb and little finger out wide to the sides.</p><p>\"Why are they doing that?\" I asked Vanez.</p><p>\"It's a customary gesture,\" he explained. \"We call it the death's touch sign. It means, 'Even in death, may you be triumphant.?</p><p>\"I'd rather they just said good luck,\" I muttered.</p><p>\"That doesn't have quite the same significance,\" Vanez chuckled. \"We believe that the gods of the vampires respect those who die nobly. They bless us when a vampire meets death proudly and curse us when one dies poorly.\"</p><p>\"So they want me to die well for their own sakes,\" I said sarcastically.</p><p>\"For the sake of the clan,\" Vanez corrected me seriously. \"A vampire in good standing always puts the good of the clan before his own well-being. Even in death. The hand gesture is to remind you of that.\"</p><p>The Aquatic Maze was built in the pit of a large cavern. From the top it looked like a long square box. Around the sides of the pit were forty or fifty vampires, the most the cave could hold. Among them were Gavner and Kurda, Seba Nile and Arra Sails - and Mika Ver Leth, the Vampire Prince who'd sentenced me to the Trials.</p><p>Mika summoned us over, nodded gravely to Vanez and Mr. Crepsley, then fixed his icy gaze on me. He was dressed in his customary black outfit and looked even sterner than Mr. Crepsley. \"You have prepared for the Trial?\" he asked.</p><p>\"I have.\"</p><p>\"You know what lies ahead of you?\"</p><p>\"I do.\"</p><p>\"Except for the four exits, there is no escape from the maze,\" he said. \"Should you fail this Trial, you will not have to face the Hall of Death.\"</p><p>\"I'd rather die at the stakes to drowning,\" I grunted.</p><p>\"Most vampires would,\" he agreed. \"But you don't need to worry - it is still water, not running.\"</p><p>I frowned. \"What's that got to do with anything?\"</p><p>\"Still water cannot trap a vampire's soul,\" he explained.</p><p>\"Oh, that old myth,\" I laughed. Many vampires believed that if you died in a river or stream, your soul remained trapped forever by the flowing water. \"That doesn't bother me. It's the drowning I don't like!\"</p><p>\"Either way, I wish you luck,\" Mika said.</p><p>\"No, you don't.\" I sniffed.</p><p>\"Darren!\" Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>\"It's all right.\" Mika silenced him with a wave of his hand. \"Let the boy speak his mind.\"</p><p>\"You made me take the Trials,\" I said. \"You don't think I'm good enough to be a vampire. You'll be happy if I fail, because it'll prove you were right.\"</p><p>\"Your assistant has a low opinion of me, Larten,\" Mika remarked.</p><p>\"He is young, Mika. He does not know his place.\"</p><p>\"Don't apologize for him. The young should speak their minds.\" He addressed me directly again. \"You are right in one thing only, Darren Shan - I don't think you have what it takes to make it as a vampire. As for the rest of what you say...\" - He shook his head - \"No vampire takes pleasure in seeing another fail. I sincerely hope you prove me wrong. We need vampires in good standing, now more than ever. I will raise a glass of blood to your name if you complete the Trials, and willingly admit in public that I misjudged you.\"</p><p>\"Oh,\" I said, confused. \"In that case, I guess I'm sorry for what I said. No hard feelings?\"</p><p>The black-haired, eagle-eyed Prince smiled tightly. \"No hard feelings.\" Then he clapped his hands loudly and barked sharply, \"May the gods bless you with the luck of the vampires!\" - and the Trial began.</p><p>I was blindfolded, placed on a stretcher, and carried into the heart of the maze by four guards - so I couldn't memorize the way. Once inside, I was set down and the blindfold was removed. I found myself in a narrow corridor, about five feet wide, less than six and a half feet high. My size would work in my favor in this Trial - tall vampires had to stoop, which made the going even harder.</p><p>\"Are you ready?\" one of the guards asked.</p><p>\"I'm ready,\" I said, glancing around the corridor to find my first marker. I saw a whitish stone in the wall to my left and made note of it, starting my mental map-making process.</p><p>\"You must stay here till the water pours,\" the guard said. \"That's the signal for the start of the Trial. Nobody can check on you once we leave, so there's nothing to prevent you from cheating, apart from your conscience.\"</p><p>\"I won't cheat,\" I snapped. \"I'll wait for the water.\"</p><p>\"I'm sure you will,\" the vampire smiled apologetically. \"I had to say it anyway - tradition.\"</p><p>The four guards gathered up the stretcher and left. They were all wearing extrasoft shoes, so their footsteps made no noise.</p><p>Small candles were set in glass bulbs in the roof of the maze, so I'd have plenty of light to see by, even when the water rose high.</p><p>My nerves gnawed at me while I was waiting for the water to gush. A cowardly voice inside my head nudged me to make an early start. Nobody would ever know. Better to live with a little shame than die because of stupid pride.</p><p>I ignored the voice - I'd never be able to look Mr. Crepsley, Gavner, or the others in the eye if I cheated.</p><p>Finally there was a gurgling sound, and water bubbled up out of a nearby pipe. Breathing a sigh of relief, I hurried for the end of the corridor, dragging my rock behind me, shaking the rope at regular intervals, as Vanez had taught me.</p><p>I made good time at the beginning. The water barely held me back, and there were plenty of striking stones to identify the different corridors by. I didn't panic when I came to a dead end or worked my way back to a corridor I'd already visited; I just stuck my head down and kept walking, taking a new route.</p><p>The going got tough after five or six minutes. The water was up above my knees. Each step was an effort. The rock now felt as if it weighed a ton. I was having trouble breathing, and my muscles ached, especially in my legs and back.</p><p>Still I didn't panic. Vanez had prepared me for this. I had to accept the water, not fight it. I let my pace drop. The mistake many vampires made was to try walking quickly - they exhausted themselves early and never got anywhere near the end.</p><p>Another couple of minutes passed. I was growing anxious. There was no way to tell how close or far from the finish I was. I could be a single turn away from an exit door without knowing it - or nowhere near one. At least I'd recognize an exit if I saw it - a huge white X was painted on all four doors and a large black button was in the center of the X. All I had to do was press that button, and the door would open, the water would flood out, and I'd be safe.</p><p>The trouble was finding it. The water was up to my chest by this point, and the rock was getting heavier all the time. I'd stopped shaking the rope - it was too much of an effort - and could feel it drifting along behind me, threatening to get caught between my legs. That happened sometimes - vampires got knotted up in the rope and came to a standstill, drowning where they stood.</p><p>I was turning a corner when the rock snagged on something. I gave the rope a pull, trying to free it - with no luck. Taking a deep breath, I dived down to see what was wrong. I found that the rock had jammed against a large crack in a wall. It only took a few seconds to pry it loose, but when I sprang up, I suddenly realized that my mind was a blank. Had I been in this tunnel before? I looked for a familiar sign, but couldn't see any. There was a yellow stone high up in one of the walls, and I thought I'd passed it earlier, but I didn't know for sure.</p><p>I was lost!</p><p>I lurched to the end of the corridor, then up another, desperately trying to establish my position. Panic flooded my system. I kept thinking, \"I'm going to drown! I'm going to drown!\" I could have passed a dozen markers and not recognized any of them, I was so stressed out.</p><p>The water was up to my chin. It splashed into my mouth. Sputtering, I slapped at the water, as though that would make it go away. I stumbled and fell. Came up spitting water and gasping. Terrified, I started to scream...</p><p>... and that stopped me. The sound of my roars snapped me back to my senses. I remembered Vanez's advice, stood perfectly still, shut my eyes, and refused to budge until I had the panic under control. I concentrated on the thought of the feast that awaited me. Fresh meat, wild roots, and fruit. A bottle of human blood to perk me up. Dessert - mountain berries, hot and juicy.</p><p>I opened my eyes. My heart had stopped beating like a drum, and the worst of the panic attack had passed. I waded slowly down the corridor, searching for a marker. If I could find one, I was sure I'd recall the rest of my mental map. I reached the end of the corridor - no markers. The next corridor was also new to me. And the one after that. And the next.</p><p>I could feel the panic bubbling up again when I spotted a candleholder set in a pale grey circular stone - one of my markers! I stared at the candle and waited for my map to reform. For several long seconds my mind remained as terrifyingly blank as it had been - then the map fell back into place. It came to me in sections first, a piece at a time, then in a rush. I stood where I was for a few more seconds, making sure I had it clear in my head before continuing.</p><p>The water was up to my lower lip now. The movement was almost impossible. I had to proceed in sluggish jumps, lurching forward to keep my head above water, being extra careful not to bash it on the ceiling. How long before I ran out of air? Three minutes? Four? It couldn't be much more than that. I had to find the way out - and quick!</p><p>Concentrating on the map inside my head, I tried figuring out how far away I was from the spot where I'd started. By my calculations, I should be near one of the border walls. If I was, and the exit door was close by, I stood a chance. Otherwise the Trial was as good as over.</p><p>Turning a corner, I ran into my first stretch of border wall. I knew it immediately, because the stones were darker and rougher than the rest of the maze. There was no X printed on it, but my heart gave a joyous leap anyway. Backtracking, I banished the map from my thoughts - it was no use to me anymore - and hurried to the next turn, searching for that elusive X.</p><p>I found four different sections of border wall, none of which contained the exit. The water was almost up to the ceiling now. I was swimming more than walking, pressing my lips to the ceiling to draw in air. I'd have been OK if it wasn't for the horrible rock - it dragged behind me worse than ever when I tried to swim, slowing me down to a crawl.</p>","<p>As I paused to take a breath, I realized it was time to make a critical decision. Vanez had discussed this with me in the practice maze. He'd hoped things wouldn't reach this stage, but if they did, I had to choose correctly.</p><p>If I continued as I was, I'd die. I was making very little progress, and in a minute or two the water would cover my face completely, and I'd drown. The time had come to gamble. One last roll of the dice. If the luck of the vampires was with me, it would mean survival. If not...</p><p>I took several deep breaths, filling my lungs, then ducked under the water and dived to the floor. Picking up the rock, I turned over, so I was floating on my back, and placed the rock on my belly. Then I swam. It was awkward - streams of water forced themselves up my nose - but this was the only way to stop the rock from dragging me down.</p><p>Vampires can hold their breath longer than humans - five or six minutes, easily - but because I was on my back, I had to keep blowing air out through my nose, to stop the water from going up it, so I'd have two, three minutes at most before I ran out of oxygen and drowned.</p><p>Swimming around another corner, I stared down a long corridor. I could spot the shape of what must be border wall at the end, but I was too far away to see if there was an X on it or not. I thought there might be, but that could be my mind playing tricks - Vanez had warned me about underwater mirages.</p><p>I swam up the corridor. About halfway, I realized there was no X - a long crack in the stones had fooled me - so I turned and quickly headed back the way I'd come. The weight of the rock was forcing me down. I stopped, put my feet on the floor, and used them to push myself up, then straightened out and resumed swimming.</p><p>I searched in vain for another glimpse of border wall, but the next two corners both led to other corridors, not the wall. My oxygen was running out. It was getting harder and harder to move my arms and legs.</p><p>The next turn didn't lead to border wall either, but I had no time to swim ahead and look for another corner. Summoning all of my energy, I swam down the short corridor and took the right turn at the end. That led to another short corridor. As I started down it, the rock slipped off my belly, scratching me as it fell. I yelped without thinking. Water rushed in, and air rushed out.</p><p>Coughing, I aimed for the ceiling to draw more air, but when I reached it, I found the water had beaten me to the punch - there was no more air.</p><p>I was treading water, silently cursing the fates and vampire gods. This was the end. I'd given it my best, but it wasn't meant to be. The best thing now would be to open my mouth, gulp in water, and make as quick an end of it as I could. I would have too, except this corridor wasn't well lit, and I didn't like the idea of dying in darkness. So, painfully, I dived again to the floor, gathered the rock, turned over onto my back, placed the rock on my belly, and swam ahead to find somewhere brighter to die.</p><p>As I made a left turn at the end of the corridor, I spotted the dark stone of border wall. I smiled weakly, remembering how excited that would have made me a few minutes ago. I rolled over onto my belly, so that I could die on my feet - then stopped.</p><p>There was an X on the wall!</p><p>I stared at it stupidly while precious air bubbles popped out of my mouth. Was this another trick of my mind? Another false crack? It must be. There was no way I could be this lucky. I should ignore it and...</p><p>No! It was an X!</p><p>I was out of air and strength, but the sight of that X gave me a new burst of life. Making use of resources I hadn't known I had, I kicked hard with my legs and shot towards the wall like a bullet. I bumped my head against it, recoiled, then rolled over and studied the large, rough X.</p><p>I was so delighted to find the X, I almost didn't think to push the button in its center. What a joke that would have been - to come so far and fail at the very end! But thankfully, I was spared that shame. Of its own accord, my left hand crept out, ran its fingers over the button set in the X, then pressed it. The button slid inwards, and the X vanished as the stone slid back into the wall.</p><p>With a huge slushing roar, water gushed out through the gap. I was carried along with it, jolting to a stop just beyond the door when my rock caught on something. My eyes and mouth were shut, and for a while it seemed as if I was still submerged in the maze, as water flooded out over my head. Gradually, though, the water level dropped, and I realized I could breathe.</p><p>After the deepest breath of my life, I opened my eyes and blinked. The cavern seemed a lot brighter than it had less than half an hour ago, when I'd been led down to it by Vanez Blane. I felt as if I was sitting on a beach on a warm summer's day.</p><p>Cheers and hollers reached my ears. Staring around like a fish on dry land, I noticed delighted vampires streaming towards me, splashing through pools of water, whooping with excitement. I was too tired to identify their faces, but I recognized the orange crop of hair on the vampire leading the way - Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>As the water subsided, I struggled to my feet and stood outside the door of the Aquatic Maze, smiling foolishly, rubbing the bump on my head where I'd hit the wall. \"You did it, Darren!\" Mr. Crepsley roared, reaching my side and throwing his arms around me in a rare display of affection.</p><p>Another vampire embraced me and yelled, \"I thought you'd had it! So much time had passed, I was sure you'd failed!\"</p><p>Blinking water from my eyes, I made out the features of Kurda and Gavner. And close behind, Vanez and Arra. \"Mr. Crepsley? Kurda? Vanez? What are you doing on a beach in the middle of the day?\" I asked. \"You'll sizzle in the sunlight if you don't watch out.\"</p><p>\"He's delirious!\" Someone laughed.</p><p>\"Who would not be?\" Mr. Crepsley replied, hugging me proudly.</p><p>\"Think I'll sit down awhile,\" I muttered. \"Call me when it's time to build sand castles.\" And, collapsing on my bottom, I stared up at the roof, convinced it was the wide open sky, and hummed merrily to myself while the vampires fussed around me.</p><p>Chapter FIVE</p><p>I WAS SHIVERRING like a bedraggled rat when I woke up late the next day. I'd been asleep for fifteen hours or more! Vanez was there to wish me good morning. He handed me a small mug full of a dark liquid and told me to drink.</p><p>\"What is it? \"I asked.</p><p>\"Brandy,\" he said. I hadn't tried brandy before. After the first mouthful, which made me gag, I decided I liked it. \"Careful.\" Vanez laughed as I poured it freely down my throat. \"You'll get drunk!\"</p><p>Laying aside the mug, I hiccuped and grinned. Then I remembered the Trial. \"I did it!\" I shouted, jumping up. \"I found the way out!\"</p><p>\"You certainly did,\" Vanez agreed. \"It was close. You were in there just over twenty minutes. Did you have to swim towards the finish?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said, then described all that had happened in the maze.</p><p>\"You performed excellently,\" Vanez said. \"Brains, strength, and luck - no vampire lasts long without a healthy measure of each.\"</p><p>Vanez led me to the Hall of Khledon Lurt to get something to eat. The vampires there applauded when they saw me and crowded around to tell me how well I'd done. I made light of it and acted humble, but inside I felt like a hero. Harkat Mulds turned up while I was digging into my third bowl of bat broth and fifth slice of bread. \"I am... glad you... survived,\" he said in his simple, direct fashion.</p><p>\"Me too,\" I laughed.</p><p>\"The betting... against you... has dropped... since you passed... the first Trial. More vampires... are betting... on you to... win, now.\"</p><p>\"That's good to hear. Have you bet anything on me?\"</p><p>\"I have... nothing to bet,\" Harkat said. \"If I did... I would.\"</p><p>While we were talking, a rumor spread through the Hall, upsetting the vampires around us. Listening closely, we learned that one of the last remaining vampires on his way to Council had arrived before dawn and immediately rushed to the Hall of Princes to inform them of vampaneze tracks he'd come across while traveling to the mountain.</p><p>\"Maybe it's the same vampaneze we found on our way here,\" I said, referring to a dead vampaneze we'd stumbled on during the course of our journey.</p><p>\"Maybe,\" Vanez muttered, unconvinced. \"I'll leave you for a while. Stay here. I won't be long.\"</p><p>When he returned, the games master seemed worried. \"The vampire was Patrick Goulder,\" he said. \"He came by an entirely different route, and the tracks were quite fresh. It's almost certain that this was a different vampaneze.\"</p><p>\"What does it mean?\" I asked, unsettled by the anxious rumblings of the vampires around us.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" Vanez admitted. \"But two vampaneze on the paths to Vampire Mountain are hardly coincidence. And when you take Harkat's message about the Vampaneze Lord into consideration, it doesn't look promising.\"</p><p>I thought again of Harkat's message and Mr. Tiny's long-ago vow that the Vampaneze Lord would lead the vampaneze against the vampires and crush them. I'd had other things to worry about, and still did - my Trials were far from over - but it was hard to ignore this ominous threat to the entire vampire clan.</p><p>\"Still,\" Vanez said, making light of it, \"the doings of the vampaneze are of no interest to us. We must concentrate on the Trials. We'll leave the other business to those best equipped to deal with it.\"</p><p>But try as we might to avoid the topic, the rumors followed us around the Halls all day long, and my achievements of the night before went unmentioned - nobody was interested in the fate of a single half-vampire while the future of the race itself hung in the balance.</p><p>Hardly anyone paid attention to me when I turned up with Vanez Blane at the Hall of Princes at dusk. A few pressed their right-hand fingers to their forehead and eyelids when they saw the purple flag - the death's touch sign - but they were too preoccupied to discuss my first Trial with me. We had to wait a long time for the Princes to beckon us forward - they were arguing with their Generals, trying to decide what the vampaneze were up to and how many might be skulking around. Kurda was standing up for his outcast friends.</p><p>\"If they meant to attack us,\" he shouted, \"they would have done so on the trail, while we were coming singly or in pairs.\"</p><p>\"Maybe they plan to attack us on the way back,\" someone retorted.</p><p>\"Why should they?\" Kurda challenged him. \"They've never attacked before. Why start now?\"</p><p>\"Perhaps the Vampaneze Lord put them up to it,\" an old General suggested, and nervous growls of agreement echoed around the Hall.</p><p>\"Nonsense!\" Kurda snorted. \"I don't believe those old legends. Even if they are true, Mr. Tiny said the night of his coming was at hand - not already upon us.\"</p><p>\"Kurda is correct,\" Paris Skyle said. \"Besides, attacking us in such a fashion - alone, on our way to or from Council - would be cowardly, and the vampaneze are no cowards.\"</p><p>\"Then why are they here?\" someone cried. \"What are they up to?\"</p><p>\"It's possible,\" Kurda said, \"that they came to see me.\"</p><p>Every vampire in the Hall stared at him.</p><p>\"Why should they do that?\" Paris asked.</p><p>\"They are my friends.\" He sighed. \"I don't believe this Vampaneze Lord myth, but many vampaneze do, and a lot are as troubled by it as we are - they don't want a war any more than we do. It's possible that Mr. Tiny sent word to the vampaneze as he did to us, and the pair found on the way here were coming to warn me, or to discuss the situation.\"</p><p>\"But Patrick Goulder couldn't find the second vampaneze,\" Mika Ver Leth said. \"If he's still alive, wouldn't he have contacted you by now?\"</p><p>\"How?\" Kurda asked. \"A vampaneze can't waltz up to the gates and ask for me by name. He'd be killed on sight. If he is a messenger, he's probably waiting somewhere nearby, hoping to catch me when I leave.\"</p><p>That made sense to a lot of vampires, but others dismissed it out of hand - the idea of a vampaneze going out of his way to help a vampire was lunacy as far as they were concerned - and the argument reared up again and bubbled on for another couple of hours.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley said little during the arguing. He just sat in his pew near the front, listening carefully, thinking hard. He was so absorbed in what was being said, he hadn't even noticed my arrival.</p><p>Finally, during a lull, Vanez crept forward and whispered to one of the guards, who advanced to the platform and spoke in the ear of Paris Skyle (his only good ear - his right had been chopped off many years before). Paris nodded, then clapped loudly for silence. \"We have been overlooking our duties, my friends,\" he said. \"The news of the vampaneze is worrying, but we must not let it interfere with regular Council affairs. There is a young half-vampire for whom time is precious. May we enjoy a few minutes of peace to deal with his more pressing concerns?\"</p><p>When the vampires had settled back into their seats, Vanez escorted me up to the platform.</p><p>\"Congratulations on passing the first of your Trials, Darren,\" Paris said.</p><p>\"Thank you,\" I replied politely.</p><p>\"As one who never learned to swim, I have extra reason to admire your narrow escape,\" said Arrow, the large, bald Prince, with tattoos of arrows on his arms and head. \"Had I found myself in your position, I wouldn't have made it out alive.\"</p><p>\"You did well, young Shan,\" Mika Ver Leth agreed. \"A good start is half the battle. There's a long way to go, but I'm willing to accept that I might have been wrong about you.\"</p><p>\"We would hear about more of your exploits in the maze if we had the time,\" Paris sighed, \"but, alas, that is a tale you must save for another occasion. Are you ready to choose your next Trial?\"</p><p>\"I am.\"</p><p>The bag of numbered stones was produced. After they'd been checked, I reached in, dug down, and picked one close to the bottom. \"Number twenty-three,\" the guard called out, having examined the stone. \"The Path of Needles.\"</p>","<p>\"I thought there were only seventeen Trials,\" I muttered to Vanez as the stone was taken to the Princes.</p><p>\"Seventeen for you,\" he agreed, \"but there are more than sixty in total. A lot have been omitted because they're not currently possible to host - like the pit of snakes - and others have been left out because of your size and age.\"</p><p>\"Is it a difficult Trial?\" I asked.</p><p>\"It's easier than the Aquatic Maze,\" he said. \"And your size will help. It's as good as any we could have hoped for.\"</p><p>The Princes examined the stone, announced their approval, then set it aside and wished me well. They'd treated me rather curtly, but I understood their distraction and didn't feel slighted. As Vanez and I left, I heard the arguments about the vampaneze kick into life again, and the thick air of tension in the Hall was almost as suffocating as the water in the Aquatic Maze had been.</p><p>Chapter SIX</p><p>THE PATH of Needles was a long, narrow cavern filled with sharp-tipped stalactites and stalagmites. Vanez took me to see it before we set off to practice in another cave.</p><p>\"All I have to do is walk across?\" I asked.</p><p>\"That's all.\"</p><p>\"It isn't much of a Trial, is it?\" I said confidently.</p><p>\"We'll see if you think the same way tomorrow,\" he grunted. \"The stalagmites are slippery - one wrong move and you can impale yourself in the flicker of an eye. And many of the stalactites are precariously perched, hanging by a thread. Any sudden noise will result in some falling. If one hits you on the way down, it can cut clean through you.\"</p><p>Despite his warning, I still felt it was going to be easy. But by the end of our first practice session, I'd changed my mind.</p><p>We practiced in a cave where the stalagmites weren't as sharp or as slippery as those on the Path of Needles, where the stalactites wouldn't break off and fall without warning. Yet, mild as this cave was in comparison, I came close to spearing myself several times, rescued only by the quick hands of Vanez Blane.</p><p>\"You're not gripping hard enough!\" he growled after I'd almost gouged an eye out. I'd scratched my cheek on the stalagmite, and Vanez was applying spit to the cut, to stop the flow of blood (as a half-vampire, my spit was no good for closing cuts).</p><p>\"It's like trying to hold on to a buttered pole,\" I grumbled.</p><p>\"That's why you must grip harder.\"</p><p>\"But it hurts. I'll cut my hands to shreds if I -\"</p><p>\"Which would you rather?\" Vanez interrupted. \"Bloody hands or a stalagmite through your heart?\"</p><p>\"That's a stupid question,\" I groaned.</p><p>\"Then stop acting stupidly!\" he snapped. \"You'll cut your palms to ribbons on the Path of Needles - there's no way to avoid that. You're a half-vampire, so the flesh will grow back quickly. You have to ignore the pain and focus on your grip. There will be plenty of time after the Trial to moan about your poor little fingers and how you'll never play the piano again.\"</p><p>\"I can't play the piano anyway,\" I huffed, but did as he ordered and took a firmer grip on the treacherous mineral stakes.</p><p>At the end of the session, Vanez applied special herbs and leaves to my hands, to ease the worst of the pain and toughen up my palms for the ordeal ahead. It felt for a while as though my fingers were on fire, but gradually the pain seeped away, and by the time I had to report back for my second bout of training, it was just a dull throb at the end of my arms.</p><p>We concentrated on stealth this time. Vanez taught me to check each stalagmite before transferring my weight onto it. If one snapped off in the cave, it could send me plummeting to my death, or the sound could result in falling stalactites, which were just as hazardous.</p><p>\"Keep one eye on the ceiling,\" Vanez said. \"Most falling stalactites can be avoided by simply twisting out of the way.\"</p><p>\"What if they can't be avoided?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Then you're in trouble. If one's coming for you and can't be dodged, you have to knock it sideways or catch it. Catching is harder but preferable - if you knock a stalactite out of the way, it'll crash and shatter. That sort of noise can bring the roof down.\"</p><p>\"I thought you said this was going to be easier than the Aquatic Maze,\" I complained.</p><p>\"It is,\" he assured me. \"You need lots of luck to make it out of the Aquatic Maze. On the Path of Needles, you can exert more control over your fate - your life's in your own hands.\"</p><p>Arra Sails turned up during our third practice session, to help me work on my balance. She blindfolded me and made me crawl over a series of blunt stalagmites, so that I learned to maneuver by touch alone. \"He has an excellent sense of balance,\" she noted to Vanez. \"As long as he doesn't flinch from the pain in his hands, he should sail through this test.\"</p><p>Finally, after many hours of practice, Vanez sent me back to my cell to grab some shut-eye. Once again he'd worked me just the right amount. Tired, bruised, and cut though I was, after a few hours in my hammock I felt as good as new and ready for anything.</p><p>There were hardly any vampires present at the Path of Needles to observe my second Trial. Most were locked away in the Hall of Princes, or had gathered in one of the mountain's many meeting chambers, to discuss the vampaneze. Mr. Crepsley turned out to cheer me on, and so did Gavner Purl and Seba Nile. But Harkat was the only other familiar face in the tiny crowd of well-wishers.</p><p>A guard told me that the Princes sent their apologies, but they couldn't preside over the Trial. Vanez complained - he said the Trial should be delayed if a Prince wasn't present - but the guard cited a couple of past cases where Princes hadn't been able to attend Trials, which had gone ahead without them. Vanez asked me if I wanted to push the point - he said, if we created a fuss, we could probably persuade the Princes to postpone the Trial for a night or two, till one of them had time to come down and watch - but I said I'd rather get it over with.</p><p>The guard who'd been sent by the Princes checked to make sure I knew what I had to do, wished me luck, guided me to the mouth of the Path of Needles, and set me loose.</p><p>I climbed up onto the first of the stalagmites and stared at the sea and sky of glinting spikes. The cavern was well named - from this point it looked precisely like a pathway built of needles. Suppressing a shiver, I started ahead at a snail's crawl. There was no rushing on the Path of Needles. To survive, you had to move slowly and surely. I tested each stalagmite before choosing it, shaking it gently from side to side, making sure it would hold my weight.</p><p>Bringing up my legs was tricky. There was no way to grip the tips of the stalagmites with my toes, so I had to place my feet lower down, sometimes wedging them between two stalagmites. While this gave me a chance to take the weight off my arms and hands, it resulted in lots of scratching to my knees and thighs when it came time to drag my legs forward.</p><p>It was worst in the spots where the stalactites hung low over the stalagmites. There, I had to stretch out, so that I was lying almost flat on the stalagmites, in order to wriggle ahead. I picked up many nasty cuts to my chest, belly, and back. After a while I found myself envying those fabulous Indian fakirs who can train themselves to lie on a bed of nails!</p><p>About a fifth of the way in, my left leg slipped and banged loudly against one of the stalagmites. There was a trembling, tingling sound overhead. Glancing up, I saw several nearby stalactites shaking. For a couple of seconds it seemed as if they weren't going to fall, but then one snapped free and shattered on the ground. The noise of that shook others loose, and suddenly stalactites were dropping like nail bombs all around me.</p><p>I didn't panic. Thankfully, hardly any of the stalactites fell close enough to damage me. One would have cut my right arm in two if I hadn't spotted it and shifted out of the way, and I had to suck my gut in quickly to avoid a small but sharp stalactite from ripping a new belly button in my middle. But otherwise I stayed perched where I was, watching the ceiling closely for signs of danger, and waited out the avalanche.</p><p>Eventually the stalactites stopped falling, and the echoes of their shattering died away. I waited a minute, for fear of late droppers - Vanez had warned me about those - but when all looked safe I proceeded at my same cautious pace.</p><p>The falling stalactites had taken my mind off my torn, pricked body. Adrenaline had surged through me when I saw the shower of lethal needles, and I was temporarily immune to pain. Sensation returned the farther I progressed, but I remained numb to most of the cuts, only wincing every now and then when an especially sharp point bit deeper into my flesh than usual.</p><p>I got a good grip with my feet at the halfway point and rested for five or six minutes. The ceiling was high here, so I was able to stand up and rotate my arms and neck, working some of the stiffness out of my muscles.</p><p>It was hot and I was sweating like crazy. I was wearing a tight leather outfit, which made me sweat even worse but which was necessary - loose clothes would have snagged on the stalactites.</p><p>Many vampires wore no clothes when going through the Path of Needles, but although I hadn't minded stripping to get through a valley full of sharp thorns on the way to Vampire Mountain, I wasn't about to take my clothes off in front of a bunch of strangers!</p><p>I wiped my hands on my pants, but they were so stained with blood by this point that my hands became slippier than they'd been before. Looking around, I found a few pockets of dirt and used the dust to dry my palms. The dirt got in under my torn flesh and stung as if I'd grabbed two fistfuls of prickers, but the pain subsided after a while and I was ready to continue.</p><p>I was making good time and had passed the three-quarters point when I made my first real mistake. Though the ceiling was high in this part of the cavern, the stalagmites grew close together, and I had to stretch out to crawl over them. The tips were digging into my belly and chest, so I picked up speed, anxious to clear the vicious cluster.</p><p>Reaching ahead with my left hand, I tested a large stalagmite, but only slightly - it was so big, I felt sure it would support me. As I shifted my weight onto it, there was a sharp cracking sound, and the tip broke away in my hand. I realized immediately what was happening and tried retreating, but it was too late. My weight had snapped the tip clean off, and my body dipped, slamming into a few neighboring stalagmites.</p><p>The noise wasn't especially loud, but it built like thunder, and I could hear familiar tingling sounds overhead. Easing my head around, I glued my eyes to the ceiling and watched as several small stalactites fell and smashed. They didn't bother me - even if they'd been on target, they couldn't have done much harm - but the enormous stalactite directly above caused my guts to shrivel in fearful anticipation. For a while it looked like I was safe - the initial noise didn't even make the stalactite quiver - but, as smaller stalactites dropped and exploded, the larger one began to shake, gently at first, then alarmingly.</p><p>I tried scurrying out of its way, but I was snagged on the stalagmites. It would take a few seconds to free myself. I half rolled over, creating room to maneuver. I was staring up at the stalactite, judging how long I had to wriggle clear, when I thought about the stalactites around it. If the big one fell and smashed, the vibrations would bring pretty much every stalactite in this part of the cavern down on top of me!</p><p>While I was considering the problem and trying to figure a way out of it, the large stalactite snapped abruptly in the middle, and the lower half dropped upon me in a rush, its pin-sharp tip directed like an arrow at the soft flesh of my belly - it was going to go right through me!</p><p>Chapter SEVEN</p><p>I HAS A SPLIT SECOND to think and react. For a human, it would have been all over. As a half-vampire, I stood a chance. Wriggling out of the way was impossible - no time - so I flopped onto my back, bracing myself against the flat rim of the stalagmite whose tip I'd broken off. Letting go of the stalagmites around me, ignoring the pain as a dozen sharp tips dug into me, I raised my hands above my body and grabbed for the dropping stalactite.</p><p>I caught it in midair, several inches above the tip. It slid down through my hands, shedding tiny silver splinters all along the flesh of my palms. I had to bite down hard on my tongue to hold an agonized yell inside.</p><p>Ignoring the pain, I pressed my hands closer together, gripping the stalactite as tightly as I could, and the tip came to a stop a couple of inches above my belly. The muscles in my arms creaked at the effort it took to stop and hold the heavy piece of stalactite, but didn't let me down.</p><p>Gently, with trembling arms, I laid the stalactite to one side, careful not to make any noise, then lifted myself off the stalagmites and blew on my bleeding palms, the lines of which had been severed in dozens of places by the sharp sides of the stake. By the luck of the vampires, none of my fingers had been amputated, but that was the only thing I had to feel grateful for.</p><p>The rest of my body had been similarly lacerated. I felt like I'd been stabbed all over. Blood was flowing freely from my back, arms, and legs, and I could feel a deep impression in the skin of my lower back, where the rim of the big stalagmite had cut into me. But I was alive!</p><p>I took my time going over the rest of the sharp cluster, hard as it was. Once clear, I paused, wiped the blood from my hands, licked my fingers, and rubbed spit into the worst of my wounds. I wasn't able to close cuts like full-vampires could, but the damp saliva eased some of the pain. A few sorry tears crept down my cheeks, but I knew self-pity would get me nowhere, so I wiped them away and told myself to concentrate - I wasn't out of the cavern yet.</p><p>I thought about taking off my top and ripping it to pieces, wrapping the strips around my hands to give me a firmer grip. But that would have been cheating, and the vampire blood in me boiled angrily at the suggestion. Instead, I found more pockets of dirt and used them to dry my blood-stained palms and fingers. I also rubbed lots of dirt into my feet and lower legs, which were slippery with blood that had dripped from my hands.</p>","<p>After a short rest, I continued. It wasn't so hard on this side of the cluster, but I was in such bad shape that it seemed difficult. I proceeded slowly, testing each stalagmite more thoroughly than necessary, taking no chances at all.</p><p>Finally, after more than an hour and a half on the Path of Needles - most vampires made it across in less than forty minutes - I crawled out, to be warmly greeted by the few vampires who'd gathered to cheer my success.</p><p>\"Well?\" Vanez asked, throwing a roughly woven towel around my shoulders. \"Still think it isn't much of a Trial?\"</p><p>I glowered at the games master. \"If I ever say such a stupid thing again,\" I told him, \"cut out my tongue and sew my lips closed!\"</p><p>\"Come on,\" he laughed. \"We'll wash off that blood and dirt, then get busy with the balms and bandages.\"</p><p>Supported by Vanez and Mr. Crepsley, I hobbled away from the Path of Needles and said a silent prayer that the next Trial would have nothing to do with cramped caverns and razor-sharp obstacles. If I'd known how my prayer was going to be answered, I wouldn't have bothered!</p><p>As it turned out, I didn't have to worry about my next Trial immediately. While I was showering under an icy-cold waterfall in the Hall of Perta Vin-Grahl, word reached us that the final vampire had arrived at the mountain, which meant the Festival of the Undead would begin at the end of the next day, with the setting of the sun.</p><p>\"There!\" Vanez beamed. \"Three nights and days to drink, be merry, recover, and relax. Things couldn't have worked out better if we'd planned them.\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" I groaned, using my fingernails to dig dirt out of the cuts in my legs and feet. \"I think I'll need a couple of weeks - at least!\"</p><p>\"Nonsense,\" Vanez said. \"A few nights and you'll be good as new. A little scarred and scratched, but nothing that will work against you in the later Trials.\"</p><p>\"Will I have my extra allotted day to prepare for the Trial, on top of the three days allowed for the Festival?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Of course,\" he said. \"There can be no official business during the Festival of the Undead. It's a time for rest and games and the swapping of old tales. Even the subject of the vampaneze must be put on ice for the next three nights and days.</p><p>\"I've been looking forward to this for months,\" Vanez said, rubbing his hands together. \"As a games master, I can have nothing to do with organizing or overseeing games during the Festival - so I can cut loose and really enjoy myself, without having to worry about what others are getting up to.\"</p><p>\"Can you take part in the games with just one eye?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Certainly,\" he replied. \"There are a few which require the use of both, but most don't. Wait and see - I'll crack many a head before the final ceremonies of the Festival. Dozens of vampires are going to leave the Council cursing my name and the night they crossed me.\"</p><p>When I finished showering, I stepped out of the waterfall and wrapped myself in several towels. I stood by a couple of strong torches to dry out, then Vanez bandaged the worst of my wounds, and I slipped into the light clothes he'd provided. Although the material was wafer thin, I felt uncomfortable, and as soon as I was back in my cell I got rid of the clothes and lay down na**d in my hammock.</p><p>I didn't get much sleep that night - I was too sore. Though I tried to lie still, I couldn't, and my tossing and turning kept me awake. Finally I got up, pulled on a pair of pants, and went looking for Harkat. It turned out he was back in the Hall of Princes - they were questioning him about his message from Mr. Tiny one last time, before the Festival of the Undead - so I returned to my cell, found a mirror, and passed a few hours counting the scratches on the backs of my arms and legs.</p><p>As day came - I was getting used to the passage of time inside the mountain; when I'd first arrived I hadn't been able to tell the difference between day and night - I got back in my hammock and tried to sleep again. This time I managed to doze off, and though my sleep was fitful, I squeezed in a handful of hours before the start of the much-awaited Festival of the Undead.</p><p>Chapter EIGHT</p><p>THE FESTIVAL got under way in the immense Hall of Stahrvos Glen (also known as the Hall of Gathering). Every vampire in the mountain was present. Large as the Hall was, we were squeezed in like sardines. Looking around while we waited for sunset, I counted at least four hundred heads, possibly as many as five.</p><p>Everyone was dressed up in brightly colored clothes. The few female vampires in the Hall wore long, flowing dresses, and most of the men wore handsome (but dusty) capes. Mr. Crepsley and Seba Nile wore matching red costumes and looked like father and son as they stood side by side. Even Harkat had borrowed new bright blue robes for the occasion.</p><p>I was the only one who looked out of place. I was itching like mad from my cuts and scratches and was wearing the dull, thin shirt and pants that Vanez had given me in the Hall of Perta Vin-Grahl. Even that flimsy material irritated me - I kept reaching back and plucking it off my skin. Mr. Crepsley told me several times to stop fidgeting, but I couldn't.</p><p>\"Come see me later,\" Seba whispered as I tugged at my shirt for the thousandth time. \"I have something which will ease much of the itching.\"</p><p>I started to thank the old quartermaster, but a gong sounded loudly and cut me off. Every vampire in the Hall stopped talking at the ringing of the gong. Moments later the three Vampire Princes appeared at the head of the Hall and mounted a platform so that all could see them clearly. The Festival of the Undead and the Ceremony of Conclusion - which would come at the end of Council - were the only times that all the Princes left their impregnable Hall at the top of the mountain. At least one of them was always present the rest of the time.</p><p>\"It is good to see you, my friends.\" Paris Skyle beamed.</p><p>\"We welcome you all to Vampire Mountain,\" Mika Ver Leth said.</p><p>\"And wish you well during your stay,\" Arrow added.</p><p>\"I know all of you have heard the rumors of the vampaneze,\" Paris said. \"These are troubling times, and there is much to discuss and plan. But not during these next three nights. Because this is the Festival of the Undead, where every vampire is equal, and all must enjoy themselves.\"</p><p>\"I'm sure everyone's eager to get the festivities rolling,\" Mika said. \"But first the roll call of those who've passed on to Paradise since last we met for Council.\"</p><p>Arrow called out the names of nine vampires who'd died during the past twelve years. As each name was announced, the vampires in the Hall made the death's touch sign and muttered in unison, \"Even in death, may he be triumphant.\"</p><p>When the last name had been called, Paris clapped his hands and said, \"That is the last piece of official business out of the way. There shall be no more until the close of the Festival. Luck to you, my friends.\"</p><p>\"Luck!\" the vampires shouted, and then they were tossing their capes off, roughly hugging each other, and hollering at the tops of their voices, \"Luck! Luck! Luck!\"</p><p>The next several hours were so exciting, I almost managed to forget about my cuts and the itching. I was swept along to the gaming Halls by a wave of vampires eager to test themselves against old friends and foes. Some couldn't wait to reach the Halls and began wrestling and boxing in the tunnels on the way. They were kept apart by more level-headed vampires and carried - often struggling and protesting - down to the Halls, where they could fight in comfort and for the benefit of an audience.</p><p>It was chaos in the three gaming Halls. Because none of the official games masters were on duty, there was nobody to bark commands or make sure everything proceeded in an orderly fashion. Vampires spilled around the Hall and over one another, challenging anyone who got in their way, lashing out joyfully.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley was no better than the rest. His usual dignity disappeared in the mad rush, and he ran around like a wild man, yelling, throwing punches, and leaping around. Even the Vampire Princes joined in the madness, including Paris Skyle, who was eight hundred years old.</p><p>I bobbed along as well as I could, trying to keep my head above the sea of writhing vampires. The initial burst of crazy activity had scared me a little - I hadn't been expecting it - but I was soon having great fun, dodging between the legs of tussling vampires and knocking them over.</p><p>At one point I found myself back-to-back with Harkat. He'd been caught up in the rush with the rest of us and was busy tossing vampires over his shoulders, left and right, as if they were bags of cotton. The vampires loved it - they couldn't understand how someone so little could be so strong - and were lining up to test themselves against him.</p><p>I had a chance to catch my breath while I was standing behind Harkat - nobody was interested in a half-vampire when there was a Little Person to challenge. Once I'd recovered some of my spent energy, I slid away and rejoined the throng of battling vampires.</p><p>Gradually the chaos died down. A lot of vampires had been injured in the fighting, and while they dragged themselves away to be patched up, those left standing paused to wipe the sweat from their brows and quench their thirst with a good long drink.</p><p>After a while the games started for real. Vampires took to the mats, wrestling rings, and bars, two or three at a time, the way they were meant to. Those too tired or too wounded to fight gathered around the sparring vampires and cheered them on.</p><p>I watched Mr. Crepsley fighting. It was some form of karate, and he was red-hot at it. His hands moved like lightning, fast even for a vampire, and he knocked down his opponents like flies, usually in a matter of seconds.</p><p>At another mat, Vanez was wrestling. The one-eyed games master was having the great time he'd predicted. While I was in attendance, he sent three vampires away with bloody noses and spinning heads, and was making short work of his fourth as I left.</p><p>I was passing a jousting ring when a laughing vampire grabbed me and pushed me forward to compete. I didn't protest - it was a law of the Festival that you never refused a challenge. \"What are the rules?\" I asked, shouting to be heard.</p><p>\"See the two ropes hanging from the overhead bar?\" the vampire who'd dragged me in asked. I nodded. \"Grab one and stand on the platform on this side. Your opponent grabs the other and faces you. Then you swing out into the middle and kick and punch each other till one of you gets knocked off.\"</p><p>My opponent was a large, hairy vampire who looked like a monster out of a comic book. I didn't stand a chance against him, but I gave it a try. Taking a firm hold of the rope, I swung out to meet him and spent a few seconds avoiding his thrashing feet and fist. I managed to kick him in the ribs and slap him around the head, but my blows had no effect, and he soon hit me square in the jaw and swatted me to the floor.</p><p>The vampires around the ring rushed forward to help me up. \"Are you OK?\" the one who'd volunteered me for the contest asked.</p><p>\"Fine,\" I said, checking my teeth with my tongue to see if any were broken. \"Is it the best out of three or five?\"</p><p>The vampires cheered and slapped me on the back - they loved a fighter. I was led back to the rope and went head to head with the gorilla again. I only lasted a few seconds, but nobody expected anything different. I was carried away like a champion and handed a mug of beer. I didn't like the taste, but it would have been rude to refuse, so I drained the glass, smiled as they cheered again, then wobbled away to look for a place to sit down and rest.</p><p>A lot of beer, wine, whiskey, and brandy was being consumed (as well as plenty of blood!), but hardly any vampires got drunk. This was because vampires have stronger metabolisms than humans. The average vampire has to drink a whole barrel of beer before he gets tipsy. As a half-vampire, I wasn't as immune to the effects of alcohol as the rest. I felt quite light-headed after my mug of beer and made up my mind not to drink any more - at least not tonight!</p><p>Kurda joined me while I was resting. He was flushed and smiling. \"Crazy, isn't it?\" he said. \"All these vampires, acting like wild children. Think how embarrassing it would be if anyone saw us!\"</p><p>\"It's fun though, isn't it?\" I laughed.</p><p>\"Certainly,\" he agreed. \"I'm just glad I only have to endure it once every twelve years.\"</p><p>\"Kurda Smahlt!\" someone yelled. Looking around, we spotted Arra Sails on her favorite set of bars, twirling a staff over her head. \"How about it, Kurda - like your chances?\"</p><p>Kurda grimaced. \"I have a sore leg, Arra,\" he shouted.</p><p>The vampires around the bars jeered.</p><p>\"Come on, Kurda,\" Arra called. \"Not even a pacifist like you has the right to refuse a challenge during the Festival of the Undead.\"</p><p>Kurda sighed, took of his shoes, and advanced. The vampires gave a roar of delight, and word quickly spread that Kurda Smahlt was going into action against Arra Sails. Soon, a huge crowd had formed around the bars, most of them vampires who wanted to see Kurda end up flat on his back.</p><p>\"She hasn't been beaten on the bars in eleven years,\" I murmured to Kurda as he chose his staff.</p><p>\"I know,\" he groaned.</p><p>\"Try not to get too close to her,\" I advised him (speaking as though I was an expert, when in fact I'd only been on the bars once before). \"The more you stay away, the longer you can drag it out.\"</p><p>\"I'll bear that in mind.\"</p><p>\"And be careful,\" I warned him. \"She'll crack your head right open if you give her the chance.\"</p><p>\"Are you trying to encourage or discourage me?\" he snapped.</p><p>\"Encourage, of course.\" I grinned.</p><p>\"Well, you're doing a lousy job of it!\"</p><p>He tested a staff, liked the feel of it, and hopped onto the bars. The vampires cheered and moved back, so there'd be plenty of room for him to fall.</p><p>\"I've been waiting for decades to get you up here.\" Arra smiled, twirling her staff and advancing.</p>","<p>\"I hope it proves worth the wait,\" Kurda said, blocking her first blow and dancing away from her on the bar.</p><p>\"You managed to avoid me last time, but there's no escape now. I'm going to -\"</p><p>Kurda launched a few blows of his own, and Arra leapt backwards, surprised. \"Are you here to talk or fight?\" Kurda asked pleasantly.</p><p>\"To fight!\" Arra snarled, then concentrated.</p><p>The two sparred cautiously for a few minutes, testing each other. Then Arra's staff connected with one of Kurda's knees. It seemed like a mild enough blow, but he teetered on the bar and dropped his guard. Arra grinned and darted forward to finish him off. As she did, Kurda leapt across to a parallel bar and brought his staff around in a broad swing.</p><p>Arra was completely taken by surprise, and there was nothing she could do as the staff swept her legs out from under her. She fell to the floor with a thump - defeated! There was a stunned silence, then the vampires roared their approval and surged forward to shake Kurda's hand. He thrust through them to check on Arra and see if she was OK. The vampiress slapped his hands away as he bent to help her up. \"Don't touch me!\" she seethed. \"I was only trying -,\" he began. \"You cheated!\" she interrupted. \"You faked injury. I want to make it the best out of three.\"</p><p>\"I beat you fair and square,\" Kurda said evenly. \"There's no rule against faking injury. You shouldn't have leapt in for the kill like you did. If you hadn't been so eager to disgrace me, my trick wouldn't have worked.\"</p><p>Arra glared at the soon-to-be Vampire Prince, then dropped her gaze and muttered, \"There is truth in your words.\" Lifting her eyes, she stared directly at Kurda. \"I apologize for insulting you, Kurda Smahlt. I spoke in anger. Will you forgive me?\"</p><p>\"I will if you'll take my hand.\" Kurda smiled.</p><p>Arra shook her head shortly. \"I cannot,\" she said miserably. \"You beat me cleanly, and it shames me to refuse your hand - but I cannot bring myself to take it.\"</p><p>Kurda looked hurt, but forced a smile. \"That's OK,\" he said. \"I forgive you anyway.\"</p><p>\"Thank you,\" Arra said, then turned and ran from the Hall, her features contorted with the pain of overwhelming shame.</p><p>Kurda was heavy-hearted when he sat down beside me. \"I feel sorry for her,\" he sighed. \"It must be cruel to be so set in one's ways. Her refusal to shake my hand will haunt her the rest of her life. In her eyes, and the eyes of those who think like her, she's committed an unpardonable act. It doesn't matter much to me whether she shakes my hand or not, but she'll feel she's disgraced herself.\"</p><p>\"Nobody could believe it when you beat her,\" I said, trying to cheer him up. \"I thought you weren't supposed to be any good when it came to fighting.\"</p><p>Kurda laughed lightly. \"I choose not to fight - it doesn't mean I can't! I'm no heroic vampire, but I'm not the useless coward many think I am.\"</p><p>\"If you fought more often, they wouldn't think that,\" I noted.</p><p>\"True,\" he admitted. \"But their opinion doesn't matter.\" Kurda put his fingers on my chest and pressed softly down on my heart. \"In here is where a man should judge himself, not on bars or in a ring or on a battlefield. If you know in your heart that you're true and brave, that should be enough.</p><p>\"Of the nine vampires who've died since last Council, five could have been here tonight, alive and well, had they not been determined to prove themselves to others. They drove themselves to early graves, just so their companions would admire them.\" He lowered his head and sighed deeply. \"It's stupid,\" he mumbled. \"Pointless and sad. And one night it may prove to be the end of us all.\"</p><p>Rising, he drifted away, sullen and depressed. I sat where I was for a long time after he'd gone, studying the bloodied, battling vampires and mulling over the peaceful Kurda's solemn, troubling words.</p><p>Chapter NINE</p><p>AS THE NEW DAY DAWNED most vampires retired to their coffins. They'd have happily continued fighting and drinking, but the first of the formal balls was at sunset, and they had to prepare for it. There'd be three balls during the Festival of the Undead, one at the end of each day. Two large Halls were used for the balls, so all the vampires could fit.</p><p>The ball was a strange event. Most of the vampires were dressed in their colorful clothes, as they had been earlier, but now their shirts, pants, and capes were torn, ripped, and blood-stained, while their bodies and faces were scratched and bruised. Many had broken arms and legs, but every single one of them took to the dance floor, even those on crutches.</p><p>At the stroke of sunset, the vampires all raised their faces to the ceiling and howled like wild wolves. The howling went on for several minutes, each vampire holding his or her howl as long as possible. They called this the howl of the night, and it was performed at the first ball of each Festival. The aim was to outlast the others - the vampire who held the howl the longest would win the title \"of the Howl\" and carry it until the following Council. So, if I'd won, I'd have had to be addressed as Darren Shan of the Howl for the next twelve years.</p><p>Of course, I didn't come close to winning - since I was only a half-vampire, my voice was one of the weakest, and I was among the first to fall silent. Gradually, as the voices of the others cracked, they fell silent too, one by one, until in the end only a handful were howling, their faces red with the strain of such a fierce bellow. While the last few vampires howled themselves hoarse, the rest urged on their favorites - \"Keep it up, Butra!\" \"Howl like a demon, Yebba!\" - and pounded the floor with their feet and hands.</p><p>In the end the contest was won by a huge vampire called Yebba. He'd won it twice before - though not at the last Council - and was a popular victor. There was a short ceremony, in which he had to drink a tub of blood straight down without pause, then Paris Skyle dubbed him Yebba of the Howl. Almost as soon as the words had left the Prince's lips, the band began to play, and the vampires started to dance.</p><p>The band consisted entirely of drummers, who kept up a slow, heavy beat. As the vampires danced stiffly - short steps, in time with the funereal music - they chanted the words of ancient songs, telling of great battles and vampire champions, praising those who'd died nobly, and cursing those who'd betrayed or shamed the clan (though they didn't name them - it was a custom never to mention the names of traitors or vampires of poor standing).</p><p>I tried dancing - everybody had a turn - but I wasn't very good. I could have jumped around to something fast and loud, but this was too precise. If you didn't know how to do it right, you looked stupid. Not knowing any of the words to the somber songs was another drawback. Besides, the dancing made my itching worse than ever, and I kept having to stop to scratch my back.</p><p>After a few minutes, I excused myself and slipped away. I went looking for Seba Nile, who'd said he had something that would cure the itching. I found the quartermaster in the second chamber. He was dancing and leading the singing, so I took a seat and waited for him to finish.</p><p>Gavner Purl was in the Hall; he spotted me after a while and sat down beside me. He looked exhausted and was breathing heavier than usual. \"I only got to my coffin an hour or so ago,\" he explained. \"I was trapped by a couple of my old tutors and had to spend the entire day listening to their stories.\"</p><p>There was a break in the music, while the band drank blood and lined up their next song. Seba bowed to his companions and left the dance floor during the pause. I waved a hand in the air to grab his attention. He stopped to grab a mug of beer, then ambled over. \"Gavner. Darren. Enjoying yourselves?\"</p><p>\"I would be if I had the energy,\" Gavner wheezed.</p><p>\"How about you, Darren?\" Seba asked. \"What do you think of our Festival of the Undead?\"</p><p>\"It's weird,\" I answered honestly. \"First you all howl like wild animals - then dance around like robots!\"</p><p>Seba stifled a laugh. \"You should not say such things out loud,\" he gently chided me. \"You will hurt our feelings. Most vampires are proud of their dancing - they think they dance with great style.\"</p><p>\"Seba,\" I said, scratching my legs, \"do you remember saying you had something that would stop my itching?\"</p><p>\"I do.\"</p><p>\"Would you mind giving it to me now?\"</p><p>\"It is not so easily fetched,\" Seba said. \"We must take a short trip, down to the tunnels beneath the Halls.\"</p><p>\"Will you take me when you have the time?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I have the time,\" he said. \"But first find Kurda Smahlt. I promised I would let him accompany me when I next made the trip - he wants to map the region.\"</p><p>\"Where should I tell him we're going?\" I inquired.</p><p>\"Tell him we go where the arachnids roam. He will know where I mean. Also, grab that beautiful spider of yours - Madam Octa. I would like to bring her with us.\"</p><p>I found Kurda listening to vampires telling legendary stories from the past. Storytellers were in great demand at the Festival. Vampires didn't bother much with books. They preferred to keep the past alive orally. I don't think the full history of the vampires had ever been written down. I tugged on Kurda's elbow and whispered Seba's message to him. He said he'd accompany us, but asked me to give him a few minutes while he went and collected his mapmaking equipment. He said he'd meet us outside Seba's quarters, low in the mountain, close to the stores that the quartermaster was in charge of.</p><p>When I arrived back with Madam Octa, I learned that Gavner had also decided to join us. He thought he'd fall asleep if he stayed where he was, listening to the music, warmed by the glow of the torchers and the press of vampires. \"A stroll below decks is just what the captain ordered,\" he said, imitating a sailor's salty tones.</p><p>I looked around for Harkat - I thought he might like to see what the lower tunnels of Vampire Mountain were like - but he was surrounded by admiring vampires. Harkat's metabolism was even stronger than a vampire's, and he could drink alcohol all day and night without being affected. The vampires were astonished by his capacity for drink and were cheering him on as he drank one mug of beer after another. I didn't like to take him away from his newfound friends, so I left him.</p><p>When we were ready, we gathered together outside Seba's rooms and set off for the tunnels. The guards at the gate connecting the tunnels to the Halls weren't regular guards - no vampire could carry out his normal duties during the Festival. They weren't dressed as neatly as the regular guards, and some had been drinking, which they'd never do while on duty any other time. Seba told them where we were going, and they waved us through, warning us not to get lost.</p><p>\"We'd better not.\" Kurda smirked. \"By the smell of you, you'd have trouble finding an apple at the bottom of a barrel of cider!\"</p><p>The guards laughed and made mock threats not to let us back in. One of the more sober guards asked if we wanted torches, but Seba said we'd be OK - the walls were coated with glowing moss where we were going.</p><p>Kurda got his mapmaking equipment out when we reached tunnels where he'd never been before. It was just a sheet of gridded paper and a pencil. He paused every so often to add a tiny piece of line to the page, signifying the length of tunnel we'd traversed.</p><p>\"Is that all there is to mapmaking?\" I asked. \"It looks easy.\"</p><p>\"Tunnels aren't difficult to map,\" he agreed. \"It's different if you're trying to map open land or a stretch of seacoast.\"</p><p>\"Don't listen to him,\" Gavner said. \"Even tunnels are difficult. I tried it once and made a mess of it. You have to work to scale and make sure you mark the length exactly right. If you're off by even the tiniest fraction, it throws the rest of the map off.\"</p><p>\"It's just a skill,\" Kurda said. \"You'd pick it up quickly if you gave it a try.\"</p><p>\"No, thanks,\" Gavner said. \"I have no intention of spending my spare time trapped down a maze of tunnels, trying to map them out. I don't know what the appeal is.\"</p><p>\"It's fascinating,\" Kurda said. \"It gives you a dearer understanding of your environment, not to mention a great sense of achievement when you're finished. Apart from which, there's the practical aspect.\"</p><p>\"Practical aspect!\" Gavner snorted. \"Nobody uses your maps except you!\"</p><p>\"Not so,\" Kurda corrected him. \"Nobody's interested in helping me make maps, but plenty make use of them. Did you know we'll be building a new Hall, lower than any of the other levels, over the next few years?\"</p><p>\"A Hall of storage.\" Gavner nodded.</p><p>\"That's being constructed out of a cave I discovered, which will connect to the rest of the Halls via a tunnel nobody knew about until I went snooping Around.\"</p><p>\"There are also the breach points,\" Seba noted.</p><p>\"What are those?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Tunnels which open into the Halls,\" Seba explained. \"There are many ways into the Halls besides the main gates of entry. Kurda has unearthed many of these and brought them to our attention, so that we might seal them off against attack.\"</p><p>\"Who'd attack you up here?\" I frowned.</p><p>\"He's referring to animal attacks,\" Kurda said. \"Stray wolves, rats, and bats often crept in by breach points and went foraging for food. They were getting to be a nuisance. My maps helped put an end to most of their advances.\"</p><p>\"OK.\" Gavner smiled. \"I was wrong - your maps do serve a purpose. You still wouldn't get me down here helping you make them though.\"</p><p>We proceeded in silence for a while. The tunnels were narrow and the roofs were low-hanging, so it was hard going for the grown vampires. They enjoyed a few minutes of relief when the tunnels opened up briefly, but then they constricted again, and it was back to crouching and shuffling along. It was dark too. We had just enough light to see by, but there wasn't enough for Kurda to make maps. He dug out a candle and started to light it, but Seba stopped him.</p>","<p>\"No candles,\" the quartermaster said.</p><p>\"But I can't see,\" Kurda complained.</p><p>\"I am sorry, but you will have to do the best you can.\"</p><p>Kurda grumbled, bent his head low over the sheet of paper so his nose was almost touching it, and drew carefully as we progressed, stumbling often because he wasn't watching where he was going.</p><p>Finally, after crawling through an especially small tunnel, we found ourselves in a moderately large cave that was coated from floor to ceiling with spiderwebs. \"Quiet now,\" Seba whispered as we stood. \"We do not want to disturb the residents.\"</p><p>The ?residents\" were spiders. Thousands - possibly hundreds of thousands - of them. They filled the cave, dangling from the ceiling, hanging on cobwebs, scuttling across the floor. They were like the spider I'd spotted when I first arrived at Vampire Mountain, hairy and yellow. None was quite as large as Madam Octa, but they were bigger than most ordinary spiders.</p><p>A number of the spiders scurried toward us. Seba dropped cautiously to one knee and whistled. The spiders hesitated, then returned to their corners. \"Those were sentries,\" Seba said. \"They would have defended the others if we had come to cause trouble.\"</p><p>\"How?\" I asked. \"I thought they weren't poisonous.\"</p><p>\"Singly, they are harmless,\" Seba explained. \"But if they attack in groups, they can be dangerous. Death is unlikely - for a human, maybe, but not a vampire - but certainly severe discomfort occurs, possibly even partial paralysis.\"</p><p>\"I see why you wouldn't allow any candles,\" Kurda said. \"One stray spark and this place would go up like dry paper.\"</p><p>\"Precisely.\" Seba wandered into the center of the cave. The rest of us followed slowly. Madam Octa had crept forward to the bars of her cage and was making a careful study of the spiders. \"They have been here for thousands of years,\" Seba whispered, reaching up and letting some of the spiders crawl over his hands and up his arms. \"We call them Ba'Halen's spiders, after the vampire who - if the legends are to be believed - first brought them here. No human knows of their existence.\"</p><p>I took no notice as the spiders crept up my legs - I was used to handling Madam Octa, and before her I'd studied spiders as a hobby - but Gavner and Kurda looked uneasy. \"Are you sure they won't bite?\" Gavner asked.</p><p>\"I would be surprised if they did,\" Seba said. \"They are gentle and usually only attack when threatened.\"</p><p>\"I think I'm going to sneeze,\" Kurda said as a spider crawled over his nose.</p><p>\"I would not advise it,\" Seba warned him. \"They might interpret that as an act of aggression.\"</p><p>Kurda held his breath and shook from the effort of controlling the sneeze. His face had turned a bright shade of red by the time the spider moved on. \"Let's beat it,\" he wheezed, letting out a long, shaky breath.</p><p>\"Best suggestion I've heard all night,\" Gavner agreed.</p><p>\"Not so fast, my friends,\" Seba said with a smile. \"I did not bring you here for fun. We are on a mission. Darren - take off your shirt.\"</p><p>\"Here?\" I asked.</p><p>\"You want to put a stop to the itching, don't you?\"</p><p>\"Well, yes, but...\" Sighing, I did as Seba ordered.</p><p>When my back was bare, Seba found some old cobwebs that had been abandoned. \"Bend over,\" he commanded, then held the cobwebs over my back and rubbed them between his fingers, so that they crumbled and sprinkled over my flesh.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" Gavner asked.</p><p>\"Curing an itch,\" Seba replied.</p><p>\"With cobwebs?\" Kurda said skeptically. \"Really, Seba, I didn't think you believed in old wives' tales.\"</p><p>\"It is no tale,\" Seba insisted, rubbing the webby ash into my broken skin. \"There are chemicals in these cobwebs which aid the healing process and work against irritation. Within an hour, the itching will stop.\"</p><p>When I was covered in ash, Seba tied some thick, whole webs around the worst-infected areas, including my hands. \"We will take the webs off before we leave the tunnels,\" he said, \"although I advise against washing for a night or two - the itching may return if you do.\"</p><p>\"This is crazy,\" Gavner muttered. \"It'll never work.\"</p><p>\"Actually, I think it's working already,\" I contradicted him. \"The backs of my legs were killing me when we came in, but now the itching is barely noticeable.\"</p><p>\"If it's so effective,\" Kurda said, \"why haven't we heard about it before?\"</p><p>\"I do not broadcast,\" Seba said. \"If the curative powers of the webs were widely known, vampires would come down here to the caves all the time. They would disturb the natural routines of the spiders, forcing them farther down into the mountain, and within years the supplies would dry up. I only bring people here when they truly need help and always ask them to keep the secret to themselves. I trust none of you will betray my confidence?\"</p><p>We all said we wouldn't.</p><p>Once I'd been taken care of, Seba took Madam Octa out of her cage and set her down on the floor. She squatted uncertainly while a crowd of inquisitive spiders gathered around her. One with light grey spots on its back ducked forward in a testing attack. She swatted it away with ease, and the rest withdrew. Once she'd familiarized herself with the terrain, she explored the cave. She climbed up the walls and onto the cobwebs, disturbing other spiders in the process. They reacted angrily to her intrusion, but calmed down once they saw how large she was and that she meant them no harm.</p><p>\"They recognize majesty when they see it,\" Seba noted, pointing to lines of spiders following Madam Octa around. The one with grey spots was in the front. \"If we left her here, they would make her a queen.\"</p><p>\"Could she breed with them?\" Kurda asked.</p><p>\"Probably not,\" Seba mused. \"But it would be interesting if she could. There has been no new blood introduced to the colony for thousands of years. I would be fascinated to study the offspring of such a union.\"</p><p>\"Forget it.\" Gavner shivered. \"What if the babies turned out to be as poisonous as their mother? We'd have thousands of them roaming the tunnels, killing at will!\"</p><p>\"Hardly.\" Seba smiled. \"Spiders tend not to pick on those bigger than themselves, not while smaller and more vulnerable prey exists. Still, she is not my spider. It is for Darren to decide.\"</p><p>I watched her carefully for a couple of minutes. She looked happy out in the open, among those of her own kind. But I knew better than anyone the awful consequences of her bite. Better not to risk it. \"I don't think we should leave her,\" I said.</p><p>\"Very well,\" Seba agreed, pursing his lips and whistling softly. Madam Octa returned to her cage immediately in response, though once inside she kept close to the bars, as though lonely. I felt sorry for her, but reminded myself that she was just a spider and didn't have any real feelings.</p><p>Seba played for a while with the spiders, whistling and inviting them to crawl over him. I grabbed the flute - it was really just a fancy tin whistle - from Madam Octa's cage and joined him. It took a few minutes to tune my thoughts into the spiders' - they weren't as easy to make mental contact with as Madam Octa - but Seba and I had fun once I was in control, letting them jump between our bodies and spin adjoining webs that connected us from head to foot.</p><p>Gavner and Kurda watched, bemused. \"Could I control them too?\" Gavner asked.</p><p>\"I doubt it,\" Seba said. \"It is more difficult than it looks. Darren is naturally gifted with spiders. Very few people have the ability to bond with spiders. You are a fortunate young man, Darren.\"</p><p>I'd lost enthusiasm for spiders since that nasty business between Madam Octa and my best friend, Steve Leopard, all those years ago, but at Seba's words I felt some of my old love for the eight-legged creatures resurfacing and made myself a promise to take more of an interest in the webby world of spiders in the future.</p><p>When we were finished playing, Seba and I brushed off the cobwebs - being careful not to remove the curing webs he'd attached to my body - then the four of us crawled out to the tunnels. Some of the spiders followed us, but turned back when they realized we were leaving, all except the grey-spotted one, which trailed behind us almost to the end of the tunnel, as though in love with Madam Octa and unwilling to see her leave.</p><p>Chapter TEN</p><p>WE'D STARTED back for the Halls when I remembered the old burial site Kurda had told me about not long after I'd arrived at Vampire Mountain. I asked if we could see it. Seba was game and so was Kurda. Gavner wasn't as interested but agreed to tag along. \"Burial chambers make me feel gloomy,\" he said as we wound our way through the tunnels.</p><p>\"That's an odd view for a vampire,\" I noted. \"Don't you sleep in a coffin?\"</p><p>\"Coffins are different,\" Gavner said. \"I feel snug in a coffin. It's graveyards, morgues, and crematoriums I can't stand.\"</p><p>The Hall of Final Voyage was a large cave with a domed roof. Glowing moss grew thickly on the walls. A stream cut through the middle of the cave and exited via a tunnel that led it back underground. The stream was wide, fast, and loud. We had to raise our voices to be heard above its roar as we stood at its edge.</p><p>\"The bodies of the dead used to be carried down here,\" Kurda said. \"They were stripped, placed in the water, and let loose. The stream swept them away, through the mountain and out to the wilderness beyond.\"</p><p>\"What happened to them then?\" I asked.</p><p>\"They washed up on some far-off bank, where their bodies were devoured by animals and birds of prey.\" He chuckled when I turned pale. \"Not a pretty way to go, is it?\"</p><p>\"It is as good as any,\" Seba disagreed. \"When I die, this is how I want to be disposed of. Dead bodies are an essential part of the natural food chain. Feeding flesh to fires is a waste.\"</p><p>\"Why did they stop using the stream?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Bodies got stuck,\" Seba cackled. \"They piled up a short way down the tunnel. The stench was unbearable. A team of vampires had to tie ropes around themselves and swim down the tunnel to hack the bodies free. They were pulled back by their colleagues, since nobody could swim against so furious a current.</p><p>\"I was on that work detail,\" Seba continued. \"Thankfully I only had to pull on the rope and did not have to venture into the water. Those who went down the tunnel to free the bodies could never bring themselves to talk of what they found.\"</p><p>As I gazed down at the dark water of the stream, shivering at the idea of swimming down the tunnel to pry loose stuck corpses, a thought struck me, and I turned to Kurda. \"You say the bodies washed up for animals and birds to feed on - but isn't vampire blood poisonous?\"</p><p>\"There wasn't any blood,\" Kurda said.</p><p>\"Why not?\" I frowned.</p><p>Kurda hesitated, and Seba answered for him. \"It had been drained by the Guardians of the Blood, who also removed most of their internal organs.\"</p><p>\"Who are the Guardians of the Blood?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Do you remember the people we saw in the Hall of Cremation and the Hall of Death when I took you on a tour of the mountain?\" Kurda said.</p><p>I cast my mind back and recalled the strange, ultrapale people with the eerie white eyes, dressed in rags, sitting alone and quiet in the somber Halls. Kurda had been reluctant to discuss them and said he'd tell me about them later, but with all that had happened since, I'd forgotten to follow up on the mystery. \"Who are they?\" I asked. \"What do they do?\"</p><p>\"They're the Guardians of the Blood,\" Kurda said. \"They came to Vampire Mountain more than a thousand years ago - we don't know from where - and have lived here ever since, though small bands go off wandering every decade or so, sometimes returning with new members. They have separate living quarters beneath the Halls and rarely mix with us. They also have their own language, customs, and beliefs.\"</p><p>\"Are they humans?\" I asked.</p><p>\"They're ghouls!\" Gavner grunted.</p><p>\"That is unfair,\" Seba tutted. \"They are loyal servants, deserving of our gratitude. They are in charge of the cremation ceremonies and do a noble job of preparing the dead. Plus, they provide us with blood - that is where most of the human blood in our stores comes from. We could never ship in enough to supply the needs of all the vampires at Council, so we rely upon the Guardians. They do not let us feed directly from them, but they extract their blood themselves and pass it to us in jars.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" I asked, perplexed. \"It can't be much fun, living inside a mountain and giving their blood away. What's in it for them?\"</p><p>Kurda coughed uncomfortably. \"Do you know what a saprotroph is?\"</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\"They're creatures - or small organisms - which feed on the waste or dead bodies of others. The Guardians are saprotrophs. They eat the internal organs - including the hearts and brains - of dead vampires.\"</p><p>I stared at Kurda, wondering if he was joking. But I saw by his grim expression that he wasn't. \"Why do you let them?\" I cried, my insides churning.</p><p>\"We need them,\" Seba said plainly. \"Their blood is necessary. Besides, they do us no harm.\"</p><p>\"You don't think eating dead bodies is harmful?\" I gasped.</p><p>\"We haven't had any complaints from the dead yet,\" Gavner chortled, but his humor was forced - he looked as uncomfortable as I felt.</p><p>\"They take great care with the bodies,\" Seba explained. \"We are sacred to them. They drain the blood off first and store it in special casks of their own making - that is how they got their name - then delicately cut the torso open and remove the required organs. They also extract the brain, by inserting small hooks up the corpse's nose and pulling it out in little pieces.\"</p>","<p>\"What?\" Gavner roared. \"I've never heard that before!\"</p><p>\"Most vampires are not aware of it,\" Seba said.</p><p>\"But I have studied the Guardians in some detail over the centuries. The skulls of vampires are precious to them, and they never slice them apart.\"</p><p>\"That's somewhat unsettling,\" Kurda murmured distastefully.</p><p>\"It's disgraceful!\" Gavner snorted.</p><p>\"Cool! \"I said.</p><p>\"Once the organs and brains have been removed,\" Seba continued, \"they cook them to make them safe - our blood is as deadly to the Guardians as it is to any creature.\"</p><p>\"And that's what they live on?\" I asked, revolted but fascinated.</p><p>\"No,\" Seba replied. \"They would not survive very long if that was their only intake. They eat normal food, preserving and reserving our organs for special occasions - they eat them at marriages, funerals, and other such events.\"</p><p>\"That's disgusting!\" I shouted, torn between ghoulish laughter and moral outrage. \"Why do they do it?\"</p><p>\"We're not sure what the appeal is,\" Kurda admitted, \"but part of it may be that it keeps them alive longer. The average Guardian lives a hundred and sixty years or more. Of course, if they became vampires, they'd live even longer, but none do - accepting a vampire's blood is taboo as far as the Guardians are concerned.\"</p><p>\"How can you let them do it?\" I asked. \"Why not send these monsters away?\"</p><p>\"They are not monsters,\" Seba disagreed. \"They are people with peculiar feeding habits - much like ourselves! Besides, we drink their blood. It is a fair arrangement - our organs for their blood.\"</p><p>\"Fair isn't the word I'd use,\" I muttered. \"It's cannibalism!\"</p><p>\"Not really,\" Kurda objected. \"They don't eat the flesh of their own, so they're not really cannibals.\"</p><p>\"You're nitpicking,\" I grunted.</p><p>\"It is a thin line,\" Seba agreed, \"but there is a difference. I would not want to be a Guardian, and I do not socialize with them, but they are just odd humans getting along as best they can. Do not forget that we feed off people too, Darren. It would be wrong to despise them, just as it is wrong for humans to hate vampires.\"</p><p>\"I told you this would turn morbid.\" Gavner chuckled.</p><p>\"You were right.\" Kurda smiled. \"This is a realm of the dead, not the living, and we should leave them to it. Let's get back to the Festival.\"</p><p>\"Have you seen enough, Darren?\" Seba asked.</p><p>\"Yes.\" I shivered. \"And I heard enough too!\"</p><p>\"Then let us depart.\"</p><p>We set off, Seba in front, Gavner and Kurda fast on his heels. I hung back a moment, studying the stream, listening to the roar of the water as it entered and exited the cave, thinking about the Guardians of the Blood, imagining my dead, drained, hollowed body making the long descent down the mountain, tossed like a rag doll from rock to rock.</p><p>It was a horrible image. Shaking my head, I thrust it from my thoughts and hurried after my friends, unaware that within a frighteningly short time I would be back at this same gruesome spot, not to mourn the passing of somebody else's life - but to fight desperately for my own!</p><p>Chapter ELEVEN</p><p>THE FESTIVAL of the Undead came to a grand, elaborate close on the third night. The celebrations started several hours before sunset, and though the Festival officially ended with the coming of night, a number of vampires kept the party spirit alive late into the following morning.</p><p>There was no fighting during the final day of the Festival. The time was given over to storytelling, music, and singing. I learned much about our history and ancestors - the names of great vampire leaders, fierce battles we'd fought with humans and vampaneze - and would have stayed to listen right through the night if I had not had to leave to learn about my next Trial.</p><p>This time I picked the Hall of Flames, and every vampire in attendance looked grim-faced when the Trial was called out.</p><p>\"It's bad, isn't it?\" I asked Vanez.</p><p>\"Yes,\" the games master answered truthfully. \"It will be your hardest Trial yet. We will ask Arra to help us prepare. With her help, you might pull through.\"</p><p>He stressed the word might.</p><p>I spent most of the following day and night learning to dodge fire. The Hall of Flames was a large metal room with lots of holes in the floor. Fierce fires would be lit outside the Hall when it was time for the Trial, and vampires would use bellows to pump flames into the room and up through the floor. Because there were so many pipes leading from the fires to the holes, it was impossible to predict the path the flames would follow and where they would emerge.</p><p>\"You must use your ears as much as your eyes,\" Arra instructed. The vampiress had injured her right arm during the Festival, and it was in a sling. \"You can hear the flames coming before you see them.\"</p><p>One of the fires had been lit outside the Hall, and a couple of vampires pumped flames from it into the room so that I could learn to recognize the sound of the fire traveling through the pipes. Arra stood behind me, pushing me out of the way of the flames if I failed to react quickly enough. \"You hear the hissing?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"That is the sound of flames passing by you. It's when you hear a short whistling sound - like that!\" she snapped, tugging me back as a pillar of fire sprouted from the floor at my feet. \"Did you hear it?\"</p><p>\"Just about,\" I said, trembling nervously.</p><p>\"That's not good enough.\" She frowned. \"Just about will kill you. You have very little time to beat the flames. Every fraction of a second is precious. It's no good to react immediately - you must react in advance.\"</p><p>A few hours later, I had the hang of it and was darting around the Hall, avoiding the flames with ease. \"That's good,\" Arra said as we rested. \"But only one fire burns at the moment. Come the time of your Trial, all five will be lit. The flames will come quicker and in greater volume. You have much to learn before you are ready.\"</p><p>After more practice, Arra took me outside the Hall and over to the fire. She shoved me up close to it, grabbed a burning branch, and ran it over the flesh of my legs and arms. \"Stop!\" I screeched. \"You're burning me alive!\"</p><p>\"Be still!\" she commanded. \"You must accustom yourself to the heat. Your skin is tough - you can stand a lot of punishment. But you must be ready for it. Nobody makes it through the Hall of Flames unmarked. You will be burnt and singed. Your chances of emerging alive depend on how you react to your injuries. If you let yourself feel the pain, and panic - you'll die. If not, you might survive.\"</p><p>I knew she wouldn't say these things unless they were true, so I stood still and ground my teeth together while she ran the glowing tip of the branch over my flesh. The itching, which had all but disappeared following Seba's application of the cobwebs, flared into life again, adding to my misery.</p><p>During a break, I studied my flesh where Arra had run the flaming branch over it. It was a nasty pink color and stung when touched, like a bad case of sunburn. \"Are you sure this is a good idea?\" I asked.</p><p>\"You must grow used to the lick of flames,\" Arra said. \"The more pain we subject your body to now, the easier it will be to cope later. Be under no illusions - this is one of the most difficult Trials. You will suffer before the end.\"</p><p>\"You're not exactly filling me with confidence,\" I moaned.</p><p>\"I'm not here to fill you with confidence,\" she replied. \"I'm here to help you save your life.\"</p><p>After a short discussion between Vanez and Arra, it was decided that I should go without my usual few hours of sleep before the Trial. \"We need those extra hours,\" Vanez said. \"You've had three days and nights of rest. Right now, practice is more important than sleep.\"</p><p>So, after a brief break, it was back to the Hall and the fire, where I learned how to narrowly dodge flames. It was best to move around as little as possible during the Trial. That way you could listen more intently and concentrate on predicting where the next burst of flames was coming from. It meant getting singed and lightly burnt, but that was preferable to taking a wrong step and going up in a cloud of smoke.</p><p>We practiced until half an hour before the start of the Trial. I nipped back to my cell to catch my breath and change clothes - I'd be wearing leather shorts, nothing else - then returned to the Hall of Flames, where many vampires had gathered to wish me well.</p><p>Arrow - the bald-headed, tattooed Prince - had come from the Hall of Princes to oversee the Trial. \"I'm sorry none of us could make it last time,\" he apologized, making the death's touch sign.</p><p>\"That's OK,\" I told him. \"I don't mind.\"</p><p>\"You are a gracious competitor,\" Arrow said. \"Now, do you know the rules?\"</p><p>I nodded. \"I have to stay in there fifteen minutes and try not to get roasted.\"</p><p>\"Well put.\" The Prince grinned. \"Are you ready?\"</p><p>\"Almost,\" I said, knees knocking together. I turned to face Mr. Crepsley. \"If I don't pull through, I want you to - \", I began, but he interrupted angrily.</p><p>\"Do not talk like that! Think positively.\"</p><p>\"I am thinking positively,\" I said, \"but I know how difficult it will be. All I was going to say was, I've been thinking it over, and if I die, I'd like you to take my body home and bury it in my grave. That way I'll be close to Mom, Dad, and Annie.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley's eyes twitched (was he blinking back tears?) and he cleared his throat. \"I will do as you request,\" he croaked, then offered me his hand. I brushed it aside and gave him a hug instead.</p><p>\"I'm proud to have been your assistant,\" I whispered in his ear, then pulled away before he could say anything else and entered the Hall of Flames.</p><p>The door clanging shut behind me cut off the sound of the fires being stoked up. I walked towards the center of the room, sweating freely from the heat and fear. The floor was already hot. I wanted to rub some spit on my feet, to cool them, but Arra had told me not to do that too soon. Things would get a whole lot hotter later - better to hold some spit back for when I really needed it.</p><p>There was a gurgling sound from the pipes below. I tensed, but it was only one of the pipes shaking. Relaxing, I closed my eyes and swallowed deep breaths while there was still clean air to breathe. That was another problem I'd have to face - although there were holes in the roof and walls, oxygen would be in short supply, and I'd have to find air pockets among the flames or risk suffocating.</p><p>As I was thinking about the air, I heard an angry hissing sound in the floor beneath me. Opening my eyes, I saw a jagged funnel of flame erupt several feet to my left.</p><p>The Trial had begun.</p><p>I ignored the spouting flames - they were too far away to harm me - and listened closely for the next burst. This time it came from one of the far corners of the room. I was off to a lucky start. Sometimes, according to Arra, flames struck at you right at the beginning and didn't let up for the entire Trial. At least I had time to adjust to the heat gradually.</p><p>There was a whistling sound close to my right. I jumped aside as fire blossomed in the air nearby, then scolded myself - that burst had been close, but it wouldn't have struck. I should have stood my ground or edged carefully out of its way. Moving as I had, I could have stepped straight into trouble.</p><p>The flames were coming in quick bursts now, all around the Hall. I could feel a terrible heat building in the air, and already it was hard to breathe. A hole a few inches from my right foot whistled. I didn't move as fire erupted and stung my leg - I could tolerate a small burn like that. A large burst came out of a wider hole behind me. I shifted forward slightly, rolling gently away from the worst of its bite. I felt the flames licking at the skin of my bare back, but none took hold.</p><p>The hardest times were when two or more funnels sprang from holes set close together. There was nothing I could do when trapped between a set of fiery pillars, except suck in my belly and step gingerly through the thinner wall of flames.</p><p>Within a few minutes my feet were in agony - they absorbed the worst of the flames. I spat on my palms and rubbed spit into my soles, which provided some measure of temporary relief. I would have stood on my hands to give my feet a rest, except that would have exposed my hair to the fire.</p><p>Most vampires, when preparing for the Trials, shaved their heads months in advance, so they were bald when the Trials began. That way, if they drew the Hall of Flames, they'd stand a better chance, since hair burns a lot easier than flesh. But you weren't allowed to shave your head especially for the Trial, and things had happened so quickly with me that nobody had thought to prepare me for the possibility of facing the flames.</p><p>There was no way to keep track of time. I had to focus every last ounce of my concentration on the floor and fire. The smallest of distractions could have lethal consequences.</p><p>Several holes in front of me spouted flames at the same time. I began edging backwards, when I heard pipes whistling savagely behind me. Sucking in my belly again, I nudged over to my left, away from the thickest sheets of fire.</p><p>The moment of danger passed, but I was getting trapped in a corner. Vanez had warned me about this, even before we'd tracked down Arra and asked her to train me. \"Stay away from the corners,\" he'd said. \"Stick to the middle as much as possible. If you find yourself backing into a corner, get out of it quickly. Most who perish in the Hall of Flames do so in corners, trapped by walls of fire, unable to break free.\"</p><p>I started back the way I'd come, but the fire was still shooting up through the holes, blocking my path. Reluctantly, I edged farther towards the corner, ready to take the first opening as soon as one presented itself. The trouble was - none did.</p>","<p>The gurgling of pipes behind me brought me to a halt. Flames burst out of the floor, scorching my back. I grimaced but didn't move - there was nowhere to move to. The air was very poor in this region of the room. I waved my hands in front of my face, trying to create a draft to suck some fresh air in, but it didn't work.</p><p>The pillars of flames in front of me had formed a wall of fire, at least seven or eight feet thick. I could barely see the rest of the room through the flickering flames. As I stood, waiting for a path to open, the mouths of the pipes at my feet hissed, several of them all at once. A huge ball of fire was on its way, about to explode directly underneath me! I had a split second to think and act.</p><p>Couldn't stand still - I'd burn.</p><p>Couldn't retreat - I'd burn.</p><p>Couldn't duck to the sides - I'd burn.</p><p>Forward, through the thick banks of fire? I'd probably burn, but there was open ground and air beyond - if I made it through. It was a lousy choice, but there was no time to complain. Closing my eyes and mouth, I covered my face with my arms and darted forward into the wall of crackling flames.</p><p>Chapter TWELVE</p><p>FIRE ENGULFED and billowed around me. I'd never in my worst nightmare imagined such heat. I almost opened my mouth to scream. If I had, fire would have gushed down my throat and torched me to a crisp from the inside out.</p><p>When I burst through the other side of the fiery wall, my hair was a burning bush, and flames sprouted from my body like mushrooms. I dropped to the floor and rolled around, beating at my hair with my hands, extinguishing the flames. I paid no attention to the hisses and whistlings of the pipes. If flames had struck in those seconds of madness, they'd have devoured me. But I got lucky... lucky Darren Shan... the luck of the vampires.</p><p>Once I'd slapped out the worst of the flames, I got to my knees, groaning weakly. Sucking in hot, thin air, I prodded gently at the smoldering mess on top of my head, making sure there were no sparks waiting to flare back to life.</p><p>My entire body was black and red. Black from the soot, red where the burns had eaten through my flesh. I was in bad shape, but I had to go on. Sore as I was, and painful as it was to move, I had to. The ravenous demons of the fire would devour me if I didn't.</p><p>Standing, I tuned out the roars of the flames and listened for the sounds of the pipes. It wasn't easy - my ears had been savagely burnt, affecting my sense of hearing - but I was able to detect the faintest hints of hissing and whistling, and after a few shaky steps I was back on course, anticipating the bursts of flames and moving to avoid them.</p><p>The one good thing about wading through the wall of fire was that it had burnt out much of the feelings in my feet. There was almost no pain now beneath my knees. That meant I was dangerously singed, and part of me worried about what would happen after the Trial - if my feet were burnt beyond repair, they might have to be amputated! - but that was a worry for another time. Right now I was glad for the relief and took comfort from it.</p><p>My ears were seriously troubling me. I tried to rub some spit on them, but my mouth had dried up completely. I caressed them gently between my fingers, but that made them worse. In the end I left them alone and just did my best to ignore them.</p><p>The flames were forcing me into another corner. Rather than let myself get trapped again, I ducked through a roaring bank of fire and back to open ground, enduring the ensuing pain.</p><p>I closed my eyes as often as possible, every time there was the slightest lull. The heat was dreadful for them. They'd dried up the same way my mouth had, and I was afraid of losing my sight.</p><p>As I rolled away from yet another nasty burst of fire, the flames in the Hall began to die away. I paused suspiciously. Was this the start of an even worse assault? Could I expect a huge ball of fire to burst through the pipes and blow me away?</p><p>While I twitched and strained my ears, the door to the Hall swung open, and vampires in heavy capes entered. I stared at them as though they were aliens. What were they doing? Were they firemen who'd lost their way? Someone should tell them they shouldn't be here. It was dangerous.</p><p>I backed away from the vampires as they converged on me. I'd have warned them to get out before the next big ball of fire hit, except I had no voice. I couldn't even manage a squeak. \"Darren, it is over,\" one of the vampires said. He sounded like Mr. Crepsley, but it couldn't be - Mr. Crepsley wouldn't wander into a Hall during the middle of a Trial.</p><p>I waved a singed hand at the vampires and mouthed the words, \"Go away! Get out of here!\"</p><p>\"Darren,\" the lead vampire said again, \"it is over. You won!\"</p><p>I couldn't make sense of his words. All I knew was that a huge ball of fire was due, and if these fools were blocking my way, I'd be incapable of dodging it. Hitting out at them, I tried weaving my way through their arms to safety. I ducked the grasp of the lead vampire, but the next caught me by the scruff of the neck. His touch was painful and I dropped to the floor, screaming silently.</p><p>\"Be careful!\" the lead vampire snapped, then bent over me - it was Mr. Crepsley! \"Darren,\" he said softly, \"it is all right. You did it. You are safe.\"</p><p>Shaking my head, unable to think clearly, I mouthed the same word over and over: \"Fire! Fire! Fire!\"</p><p>I was still mouthing it when they lifted me onto a stretcher and carted me from the Hall. And even when we were outside, clear of the flames, and medics were tending to my wounds, I couldn't stop my lips from forming the word of warning, or my eyes from rolling to the left and right, fearfully searching for the telltale signs of red and yellow terror.</p><p>Chapter THIRTEEN</p><p>MY CELL. Lying on my belly. Medics examining my back, rubbing cool lotions into my skin. Somebody lifting my charred feet, gasping, calling for help.</p><p>Gazing at the ceiling. Someone holding a torch up to my eyes, peering into my pupils. A razor running over my head, scalping me, removing the remains of my burnt hair. Gavner Purl stepping forward, worried. \"I think he's -\" he starts to say. Darkness.</p><p>Nightmares. The world on fire. Running. Burning. Screaming. Calling for help. Everybody else on fire too.</p><p>Jolt awake. Vampires around me. Nightmare still playing at the back of my mind. Convinced the cell's on fire. I try to break free. They hold me down. I curse them. Struggle. Pain gushes through me. Wince. Relax. Return to fire-plagued dreams.</p><p>Finally I drifted back from the lands of delirium. I was lying facedown. I moved my head slightly to gaze around the cell. Mr. Crepsley and Harkat Mulds were sitting nearby, monitoring me.</p><p>\"Thought... I saw... Gavner,\" I wheezed.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley and Harkat sprang forward, smiling worriedly. \"He was here earlier,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"So were Kurda, Vanez, and Arra. The medics told them to leave.\"</p><p>\"I... made it?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"How bad... am I... burnt?\"</p><p>\"Very bad,\" Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>\"You look... like an over-... cooked sausage,\" Harkat joked.</p><p>I laughed weakly. \"I sound... like you... now,\" I told him.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he agreed. \"But you... will get... better.\"</p><p>\"Will I?\" I addressed the question to Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he said, nodding firmly. \"You have suffered a terrible ordeal, but the damage is not permanent. Your feet suffered the worst of the punishment, but the medics have saved them. It will take time to heal, and your hair might never grow back, but you are in no immediate danger.\"</p><p>\"I feel... terrible,\" I told him.</p><p>\"Be glad you can feel at all,\" he replied bluntly.</p><p>\"What about... next Trial?\"</p><p>\"Do not think of such things now.\"</p><p>\"I... must,\" I gasped. \"Will I... have time... to get ready... for it?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley didn't say anything.</p><p>\"Tell me... the truth,\" I insisted.</p><p>\"There will be no extra time,\" he sighed. \"Kurda is in the Hall of Princes as we speak, arguing your case, but he will not be able to persuade them to postpone. There is no precedent for a delay between Trials. Those unfit to continue must...\" He came to a stop.</p><p>\"... be taken to... the Hall of... Death,\" I finished for him.</p><p>While he sat there, trying to think of something comforting to say, Kurda returned, looking flushed with excitement. \"Is he awake?\" he asked.</p><p>\"I am,\" I answered.</p><p>Crouching beside me, he said, \"It's almost sunset. You must choose your next Trial or admit failure and be carted away for execution. If we carry you to the Hall of Princes, do you think you'll be able to stand upright for a couple of minutes?\"</p><p>\"I'm not... sure,\" I answered honestly. \"My feet... hurt.\"</p><p>\"I know,\" he said. \"But it's important. I've found a way to buy us some time, but only if you can act as if you're fine.\"</p><p>\"What way?\" Mr. Crepsley asked, astonished.</p><p>\"No time for explanations,\" Kurda snapped. \"Are you willing to give it a try, Darren?\"</p><p>I nodded weakly.</p><p>\"Good. Let's get him on a stretcher and up to the Hall of Princes. We can't be late.\"</p><p>Hurrying through the tunnels, we made it to the Hall just in time for sunset. Vanez Blane was outside, waiting with his purple flag. \"What's going on, Kurda?\" he asked. \"There's no way Darren will be ready to face a Trial tomorrow.\"</p><p>\"Trust me,\" Kurda said. \"It was Paris's idea, but we can't let on. We have to act as if we're ready to continue. It all hinges on Darren standing up and drawing his Trial. Come on. And remember - we have to act like there's nothing wrong.\"</p><p>We were all mystified by Kurda's behavior, but we had no choice except to do what he said. Entering the Hall of Princes, I heard the voices of the vampires within drop, as all eyes fixed upon us. Kurda and Mr. Crepsley carried me to the platform of the Princes, Harkat and Vanez just behind.</p><p>\"Is this young Master Shan?\" Paris asked.</p><p>\"It is, sire,\" Kurda answered.</p><p>\"He looks terrible,\" Mika Ver Leth noted. \"Are you sure he's fit to continue with the Trials?\"</p><p>\"He is merely resting, sire,\" Kurda said lightly. \"He likes to pretend to be injured, so that he can be carried around like a lord.\"</p><p>\"Really?\" Mika replied, smiling tightly. \"If that is the case, let the boy step forward and choose his next Trial. You understand,\" he added ominously, \"what we must do if he is unable?\"</p><p>\"We understand,\" Kurda said as he laid his end of the stretcher down. Mr. Crepsley followed suit. The two vampires helped me to my feet, then slowly let go of me. I teetered dangerously and almost fell. I probably would have, if there hadn't been so many vampires present - but I didn't want to look frail in front of them.</p><p>Fighting the pain, I stumbled forward to the platform. It took a long time to make it up the steps, but I didn't falter. Nobody said anything while I was climbing, and when I got there the bag of numbered stones was produced and checked as normal. \"Number four,\" the vampire clutching the bag announced once I'd drawn my stone. \"The Blooded Boars.\"</p><p>\"A tricky Trial,\" Paris Skyle mused as the stone was passed to the Princes to be certified. \"Are you ready for it, Darren?\"</p><p>\"I don't... know what it... is,\" I said. \"But... I will be... there to face it... tomorrow, as... scheduled.\"</p><p>Paris smiled warmly. \"That is good to hear.\" He cleared his throat and widened his eyes innocently. \"I, however, cannot make it. I have pressing business to attend to and regretfully must miss this Trial. My good colleague Mika will take my place.\"</p><p>Mika imitated Paris's innocent look. \"Actually, I can't get away from the Hall tomorrow either. This Vampaneze Lord business takes up all my time. How about you, Arrow?\"</p><p>The bald Prince shook his head glumly. \"Alas, I also must make my excuses. My schedule is full.\"</p><p>\"Sires,\" Kurda said, quickly stepping forward. \"You have already skipped one of Darren's Trials. We allowed for your absence on that occasion, but to neglect your post twice in the course of one set of Trials is unpardonable and does Darren a grave disservice. I must protest most strongly.\"</p><p>Paris started to smile, caught himself, and forced a scowl. \"There is truth in your words,\" he muttered.</p><p>\"We cannot miss another of the boy's Trials,\" Mika agreed.</p><p>\"One way or another, one of us must be present,\" Arrow finished.</p><p>The three Princes huddled close together and discussed it quietly. By the way they smirked and winked at Kurda, I knew they had something up their sleeves.</p><p>\"Very well,\" Paris said out loud. \"Darren has reported that he is fit for his next Trial. Since we cannot be there to oversee it, we have decided to postpone it. We apologize for the inconvenience, Darren. Will you pardon us?\"</p><p>\"I'll let... it pass... this time.\" I grinned.</p><p>\"How long must we wait, sires?\" Kurda asked, acting impatient. \"Darren is anxious to finish his Trials.\"</p><p>\"Not long,\" Paris said. \"One of us will be there for the Trial at sunset, seventy-two hours from now. Is that agreeable?\"</p><p>\"It is annoying, sire,\" - Kurda sighed theatrically - \"but if we have to wait, we will.\"</p><p>Bowing, Kurda led me from the platform, helped me back onto the stretcher, and carried me from the Hall with Mr. Crepsley. Once outside, the vampires set me down and laughed loudly.</p><p>\"You scoundrel, Kurda Smahlt!\" Mr. Crepsley roared. \"How did you dream that one up?\"</p><p>\"It was Paris's idea,\" Kurda replied humbly. \"The Princes wanted to help Darren, but they couldn't turn around and say they were giving him time to recover from his injuries. They needed an excuse to save face. This way, it looks as though Darren was ready and willing to proceed, so there's no shame in postponing it.\"</p>","<p>\"That's why... I had to stand,\" I noted. \"So nobody would be... suspicious.\"</p><p>\"Correct.\" Kurda beamed. \"Everyone in the Hall knows what's really happening, but as long as it looks as if everything is in order, nobody will object.\"</p><p>\"Three nights... and days,\" I mused. \"Will it be... enough?\"</p><p>\"If not, it will not be for want of trying,\" Mr. Crepsley said with fierce determination, and we set off down the tunnels at a brisk pace to find some medics capable of knocking me back into shape before I had to face the Blooded Boars.</p><p>Chapter FOURTEEN</p><p>TIME PASSED slowly while I was confined to my recovery hammock. Medics fussed over me, rubbing lotions into my charred flesh, changing bandages, cleaning the wounds, making sure infection didn't set in. They often commented on how fortunate I was. None of the damage was permanent, except maybe the hair loss. My feet would heal, my lungs were OK, most of my skin would grow back. All things considered, I was in great shape and should thank my lucky stars.</p><p>But I didn't feel like I was in great shape. I was in pain the whole time. It was bad enough when I lay still but grew unbearable when I moved. I cried into my pillow a lot, wishing I could fall asleep and not wake until the pain had passed, but even in sleep I was tortured by the aftereffects of the fire, terrorized by nightmares, never more than a sharp twinge away from wakefulness.</p><p>I had plenty of visitors, who helped distract me from the pain. Seba and Gavner spent hours by my side, telling me stories and jokes. Gavner had started calling me Toastie, because he said I looked like a slice of burnt toast. And he offered to find a charred torch stub and draw fake ashen eyebrows on my forehead, since my own had been burnt off along with my head of hair. I told him where he could stick his torch stub - and the rest of the torch as well!</p><p>I asked Seba if he had any special cures for burns, hoping the old vampire would know of some traditional remedy that the medics were ignorant of. \"Alas, no,\" he said, \"but when your wounds have healed, we shall make another trip to the caves of Ba'Halen's spiders and find cobwebs to prevent further itching.\"</p><p>Arra often came to see me, though she spent more time talking with Mr. Crepsley than to me. The two spent a lot of time talking about the old nights and their life together when they were mates.</p><p>After a while I fell to wondering if the pair might be planning to mate again and how that would affect my relationship with the vampire. When I asked Mr. Crepsley about it, he coughed with embarrassment and snapped that I shouldn't bother him with such nonsense - Arra and he were just good friends.</p><p>\"Of course you are.\" I chuckled, giving him a knowing wink.</p><p>Kurda could only get down to see me a couple of times. Now that the Festival of the Undead was out of the way, there was a lot of business for the vampires to discuss, much of it connected to the vampaneze. As a senior General and vampaneze expert, he had to spend most of his waking hours in meetings and conferences.</p><p>Arra was with me on one of the rare occasions when Kurda came. She stiffened when she saw him, and he started to withdraw, to avoid a confrontation. \"Wait,\" she called him back. \"I want to thank you for what you did for Darren.\"</p><p>\"It was nothing.\" He smiled.</p><p>\"It wasn't,\" she disagreed. \"Many of us care about Darren, but only you had sense enough to steer him to safety in his hour of need. The rest of us would have stood by and watched him die. I don't agree with your ways - there's a thin line between diplomacy and cowardice - but sometimes they do work better than our own.\"</p><p>Arra left, and Kurda smiled lightly. \"Do you know,\" he remarked, \"that's the closest she'll ever get to saying she likes me.\"</p><p>Kurda fed me some water - I was on a liquids-only diet - and told me what had been happening while I was out of action. A committee had been established to discuss the workings of the vampaneze and what to do in the event of the emergence of a Vampaneze Lord. \"For the first time, they're seriously talking about making peace with the vampaneze,\" he said.</p><p>\"That must make you happy.\"</p><p>He sighed. \"If this had happened a few years ago, I'd have been whooping with glee. But time's running out. I think it's going to take more than a mere committee to unite the tribes and combat the threat of the Vampaneze Lord.\"</p><p>\"I thought you didn't believe in the Vampaneze Lord,\" I said.</p><p>He shrugged. \"Officially, I don't. Between you and me...\" - He lowered his voice - \"The thought of him scares me silly.\"</p><p>\"You think he's real?\" I asked.</p><p>\"If Mr. Tiny says so - yes. Whatever else I believe or don't believe in, there's no doubting the powers of Mr. Tiny. Unless we act quickly to prevent the possibility of a Vampaneze Lord arising, I'm sure he'll come. Stopping him before he gets started may involve a terrible sacrifice, but if that's the price of averting a war, so be it.\"</p><p>It was odd to hear Kurda making such a confession. If he - friend to the vampaneze - was worried, the other vampires must be terrified. I hadn't been paying a lot of attention to talk of the Vampaneze Lord, but I made up my mind to listen more closely in the future.</p><p>The next night - the last before the start of my fourth Trial - Mr. Crepsley came to see me after a meeting with Vanez Blane. Harkat was already by my hammock. The Little Person had spent more time with me than anyone else.</p><p>\"I have discussed things with Vanez,\" Mr. Crepsley said, \"and we both agree that you would be better served in preparing for your next Trial by rest rather than practice. There are no special skills required in the Trial of the Blooded Boars. You simply have to face and kill two boars that have been infected with vampire blood. It is a straightforward fight to the death.\"</p><p>\"If I can beat a wild bear, I can beat a couple of boars.\" I grinned, trying to sound upbeat - I'd killed a savage bear during our trek to Vampire Mountain.</p><p>\"Most certainly you can,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed. \"Were it not for your wounds, I would even hazard a guess that you could do it with one arm tied behind your back.\"</p><p>I smiled, then coughed. I'd been coughing a lot since the Hall of Flames. It was a natural reaction to all the smoke I'd inhaled. My lungs hadn't suffered any serious damage, so the coughing should stop in another couple of days. Mr. Crepsley handed me a glass of water, and I sipped from it slowly. I was able to feed myself now and had enjoyed my first meal since the Hall of Flames earlier in the night. I was still in pretty bad shape, but thanks to my vampire blood, I was recovering quickly.</p><p>\"Do you feel ready for the Trial?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"I'd like another twenty-four hours,\" I sighed, \"but I think I'll be OK. I walked around for fifteen minutes after breakfast and I felt good. As long as my legs and feet hold, I should be fine - fingers crossed.\"</p><p>\"I have been talking to Seba Nile,\" Mr. Crepsley said, switching subjects. \"He tells me he is thinking of retiring once Council has ended. He feels he has served long enough as the quartermaster of Vampire Mountain. He wants to see the world one last time before he dies.\"</p><p>\"Maybe he can come with us to the Cirque Du Freak,\" I suggested.</p><p>\"Actually,\" Mr. Crepsley said, watching closely for my reaction, \"we might not be returning to the Cirque Du Freak.\"</p><p>\"Oh? \"I frowned.</p><p>\"Seba has offered me the job of quartermaster. I am thinking of accepting it.\"</p><p>\"I thought nobody liked becoming quartermaster,\" I said.</p><p>\"It is not much sought after,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed, \"but quartermasters are widely respected. The running of Vampire Mountain is a great responsibility. It can also be richly rewarding - for hundreds of years you are capable of influencing the lives of every new Vampire General.\"</p><p>\"Why did he offer the job to you?\" I asked. \"Why not one of his assistants?\"</p><p>\"His assistants are young. They dream of being Generals or going out into the world and making a mark of their own. It would be unfair to tear one of them away from his dreams when I am at hand, ready and able to step into the position.\"</p><p>\"You want to do this, don't you?\" I asked, reading his desire in his expression.</p><p>He nodded. \"A decade or two ago, it would have been the furthest thing from my wishes. But life has been aimless since I quit the Generals. I had not realized how much I missed being part of the clan until I attended this Council. This would be the ideal way for me to reestablish myself.\"</p><p>\"If you want it that much, go for it,\" I encouraged him.</p><p>\"But what about you?\" he asked. \"As my assistant, you would have to remain here with me until you are old enough to leave by yourself. Do you like the idea of spending the next thirty years of your life walled up inside this mountain?\"</p><p>\"Not really,\" I said. \"I've enjoyed my stay - apart from the Trials - but I imagine it could grow boring after a couple of years.\" I ran a hand over my bald head and thought at length about it. \"And there's Harkat to consider. How will he get back if we stay here?\"</p><p>\"I will... stay with you... if you decide... to remain,\" he said.</p><p>\"You will?\" I asked, surprised.</p><p>\"Part of... my memory... has come back. Much is... still blank, but I... recall Mr. Tiny... telling me the only... way I could... find out who I... was before I died... was by... sticking with you.\"</p><p>\"How can I help you find out who you were?\" I asked.</p><p>Harkat shrugged. \"I do not... know. But I will... stay by your... side, as long... as you will... have me.\"</p><p>\"You don't mind being cooped up inside a mountain?\" I asked.</p><p>Harkat smiled. \"Little People... are easily... pleased.\"</p><p>I lay back and considered the proposal. If I stayed, I could learn more about the ways of the vampires, perhaps even train to be a Vampire General. The idea of being a General appealed to me - I could picture myself leading a troop of vampires into battle with the vampaneze, like a pirate captain or an officer in the army.</p><p>On the other hand, I'd maybe never see Evra Von or Mr. Tall or my other friends at the Cirque Du Freak again. No more traveling around the world, performing for audiences, or luxury comforts like going to the movies or ordering Chinese take-out - not for thirty-odd years at least!</p><p>\"It's a huge decision,\" I mused aloud. \"Can I have some time to think it over?\"</p><p>\"Of course,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"There is no rush. Seba expects no answer until after Council. We will discuss it in further detail when you have concluded your Trials.\"</p><p>\" If I conclude them.\" I grinned nervously.</p><p>\"When,\" Mr. Crepsley insisted, and smiled reassuringly.</p><p>Chapter FIFTEEN</p><p>THE FOURTH Trial - the Blooded Boars.</p><p>It seemed as if half the vampires in the mountain had turned out to watch me take on the two wild boars. I learned, as I waited for the Trial to start, that interest in me was at an all-time high. Many vampires had expected me to fail long before this. They were amazed that I'd survived the Hall of Flames. Already the storytellers of Vampire Mountain were busy turning my exploits into the stuff of modern legend. I heard one of them describing my Trial on the Path of Needles, and to listen to him tell it, I'd endured ten avalanches and been pierced clean through the stomach by a falling stalactite, which had to be cut out of me after the Trial!</p><p>It was fun listening to the murmured stories spreading through the crowds of vampires, even if most was nonsense. They made me feel like King Arthur or Alexander the Great.</p><p>\"Don't go getting a swelled head,\" Gavner laughed, noting the way I was listening intently to the tales. He was keeping me company while Vanez chose my weapons. \"Exaggeration is the key to every legend. If you fail in this or the final Trial, they'll make out that you were a lazy, stupid, good-for-nothing and hold you up as an example for future vampires. 'Work hard, my boy, they'll say, 'or you'll end up like that wastrel Darren Shan.?</p><p>\"At least they won't be able to say I snored like a bear,\" I retorted.</p><p>Gavner grimaced. \"You've been spending too much time around Larten,\" he growled.</p><p>Vanez returned and handed me a small spiked wooden club and a short spear. \"These are the best I could do,\" he said, scratching the skin beneath his missing left eye with the tip of the spear. \"They aren't much, but they'll have to do.\"</p><p>\"These will be fine,\" I said, though I'd been hoping for something more deadly.</p><p>\"You know what will happen?\" he asked.</p><p>\"The boars will be released into the ring at the same time. They might scrap with each other at the start, but as soon as they smell me, they'll focus on me.\"</p><p>Vanez nodded. \"That's how the bear tracked you down on your way here, and why he attacked you. Vampiric blood heightens an animal's senses, especially its sense of smell. They go for whatever smells the strongest.</p><p>\"You'll have to get close to the boars to kill them. Use your spear to stab at their eyes. Save your club for their snouts and skulls. Don't bother with their bodies - you'd be wasting your energy.</p><p>\"The boars probably won't coordinate their attacks. Usually, when one moves in for the kill, the other hangs back. If they do come at you together, they might get in each other's way. Use their confusion if you can.</p><p>\"Avoid their tusks. If you get stuck on a set, get off them quickly, even if you have to drop your weapons to free yourself. There's only so much damage they can do if you steer clear of their tusks.\"</p><p>A bugle call announced the arrival of Mika Ver Leth, who would be presiding over the Trial. The black-garbed Prince bade me good evening and asked if I was ready to begin. I told him I was. He wished me luck and made the death's touch sign, checked to make sure I was carrying no concealed weapons, then swept away to take his position, while I was led into the arena.</p>","<p>The arena was a big round pit in the ground. A sturdy wooden fence had been built around it to make sure the boars couldn't escape. Vampires stood around the fence, cheering like a crowd of Romans at the Colosseum.</p><p>I stretched my arms above my head and winced at the pain. Much of my flesh was tender, and some of my wounds were already seeping beneath my bandages. My feet weren't too painful - a lot of the nerve endings had been burnt out, and it would be weeks, maybe months, before they grew back - but I stung piercingly everywhere else.</p><p>The doors to the pit swung open, and two caged boars were dragged in by guards. A hush settled over the observing vampires. Once the guards had retreated and shut the doors, the locks of the cages were undone by overhead wires, and the cages were lifted out of the pit by ropes. The boars grunted angrily when they found themselves in the open. They immediately headbutted each other, locking tusks. They were fierce creatures, five feet long, maybe three feet high.</p><p>When my scent reached the pair, they stopped fighting and backed away from each other. One spotted me and squealed. The other followed the gaze of the first, set its sights on me, and charged. I raised my spear defensively. The boar turned about ten feet away from where I was standing and wheeled off to one side, snorting savagely.</p><p>The far-off boar trotted towards me, slowly, purposefully. It stopped several feet away, eyed me evilly, pawed the ground with its hooves, then darted. I easily avoided its lunge and managed to strike one of its ears with the head of my club as it sped past. It roared, made a quick turn, and came at me again. I jumped over it this time, jabbing at its eyes with my spear, missing narrowly. When I landed, the second boar attacked. It threw itself at me, opening and shutting its jaws like a shark, twirling its tusks wildly.</p><p>I dodged the assault but stumbled as I did. Because of the destroyed nerve endings in my feet, I realized I couldn't rely on them as much as I used to. Numbness in my soles meant I could trip at any time, without warning. I'd have to tread carefully.</p><p>One of the boars saw me stumbling and rammed me hard from the side. Luckily, its tusks didn't catch, and though the blow knocked the wind out of me, I was able to roll away and regain my balance.</p><p>I didn't have much time to get ready for the next attack. Almost before I knew it, a huge hunk of heaving flesh was coming straight at me. Acting on instinct, I stepped aside and thrust with my spear. There was a loud yelp, and when I raised the tip of the spear it was red with blood.</p><p>There was a brief respite while the boars circled me. It was easy to spot the one I'd injured - there was a long gash down one side of its snout, from which blood was dripping - but it wasn't a serious injury and would do little to prevent more attacks.</p><p>The bloodied boar half lunged at me. I waved my club at it, and it spun away, snorting. The other made a serious run, but lowered its head too soon, so I was able to avoid it by stepping quickly aside.</p><p>The vampires overhead were yelling advice and encouragement, but I drowned out the sound of their cries and focused on the boars. They were circling me again, raking up dust with their hooves, taking deep determined breaths.</p><p>The unharmed boar suddenly stopped circling and charged. I edged aside, but it kept its head up and followed me. Tensing the muscles in my legs, I jumped and tried braining it with my club. But I'd mistimed my jump, and instead of connecting with the boar, the boar connected with me.</p><p>Its head and shoulders knocked my legs out from under me, and I fell heavily to the floor. The boar turned quickly and was over me before I could get up, its hot breath clouding my face, its tusks flashing dangerously in the dim light of the pit.</p><p>I slapped at the boar with my club, but was in no position to make the blows count. It shrugged them off and poked at me with its tusks. I felt one tusk cut through the bandages around my belly and slice shallowly into the burnt flesh beneath. If I didn't get moving soon, the boar would do real damage.</p><p>Taking hold of the round ball at the end of the club, I jammed it into the boar's mouth, muffling its eager snuffles. The boar retreated, grunting angrily. I scrambled to my feet. As I did, the second boar slammed into me from behind. I went tumbling over the first boar, rolled head over heels like a ball, and collided with the fence.</p><p>As I sat up, dazed, I heard the sound of a boar running straight at me. With no time to get a fix on it, I dived blindly to my left. The boar missed me, and there was a ferocious clattering as it struck the fence at full speed with its head.</p><p>I'd dropped my spear, but had time to retrieve it while the boar tottered away, shaking its head, confused. I was hoping it would collapse, but after a few seconds it had recovered and looked as mean and purposeful as ever.</p><p>My club was still stuck in the mouth of the other boar. There was no way to get it back, not unless it fell out.</p><p>Taking a firm grip on my spear, I decided I'd conceded enough ground to the boars. It was time to take the fight to them. Crouching low, holding my spear out in front of me, I advanced. The boars didn't know what to make of my behavior. They made a couple of halfhearted lunges at me, then fell back warily. They obviously hadn't been infected with a large quantity of vampire blood, or they'd have attacked continuously, madly, regardless of safety.</p><p>As I herded them towards the far side of the pit, I focused on the boar with the bloody snout. It seemed to be the less secure of the two and retreated more quickly. There was a hint of cowardice about it.</p><p>I faked an attack on the braver boar with the club in its mouth, waving my spear in the air, so it turned and fled. As the other relaxed slightly, I changed course and leapt on it. I grabbed the boar by the neck and held on as it roared and bucked. It dragged me almost all the way around the pit before it ran out of steam and came to a stop. While it tried to snag with its tusks, I dug at its eyes with my spear. I missed, cut its snout, sliced its ear, missed again - then struck true and gouged its right eye out.</p><p>The roaring when the boar lost its eye almost deafened me. It tossed its head about wilder than ever and scratched my belly and chest with its tusks, but not seriously. I held on firmly, ignoring the pain in my hands and arms as burn wounds were torn open and blood flowed freely.</p><p>The vampires above me were very excited and cries of \"Kill it! Kill it!\" filled the air. I felt sorry for the boar - it only attacked me because it had been provoked - but it was him or me. This was no time for mercy.</p><p>I edged in front of the boar - a dangerous move - and readied myself for a frontal attack. I kept to the right, so it couldn't see me, held my spear high above my head, and waited for the right moment to strike. After a few frenzied seconds, the boar caught sight of me through its left eye and paused uncertainly, presenting a steady target. Bringing my arm down sharply, I drove the tip of the spear through the gap where the right eye had been, deep into the boar's crazed brain.</p><p>There was a horrible squishing sound, then the boar went mad. Rearing up on its hind legs, it let out an ear-piercing scream and dropped heavily downwards. I ducked out of its way, but as soon as it touched the ground, the boar thrashed around like a bucking bronco.</p><p>I hurried backwards, but the boar followed. It couldn't see me - it was past seeing anything - or hear me over the sound of its roars, but somehow it followed. Turning to flee, I saw the second boar preparing itself for a charge.</p><p>I halted, momentarily unsure of myself, and the dying boar crashed into me. I fell beneath it, losing my grip on the spear. As I tried to roll over, the boar collapsed on top of me, shuddered, then went still. It was dead - and I was trapped beneath it!</p><p>I strained to push the boar off, but its weight was too much. If I'd been in good physical condition, I could have done it, but I was bruised, burnt, and bloody. I simply didn't have the strength to shift the massive animal.</p><p>As I relaxed, attempting to draw a decent breath before trying again, the second boar drew up beside me and butted my head with its own. I yelped and tried scrambling away, but couldn't. The boar seemed to grin, but that might just have been the effect of the club, which was still stuck in its mouth. It lowered its head and tried to bite me, but wasn't able, because of the club. Growling, it took a few steps back, shook its head, retreated a few more steps, then pawed the ground, lowered its tusks... and charged right at me.</p><p>Chapter SIXTEEN</p><p>I'D WRIGGLED out of some sticky situations in the past, but my luck had run out. I was trapped, at the mercy of the boar, and I knew it would show no more mercy towards me than I had shown to its partner.</p><p>As I lay, waiting for the end, eyes locked on the boar, somebody shouted loudly above me. A hush had settled over the vampires, so the voice rang clearly through the cavern: \"NO!\"</p><p>A shadow leapt into the pit, darted forward into the space between me and the boar, snatched up the spear I'd dropped, jammed the blunt end into the ground, and aimed the tip at the charging boar. The boar had no time to swerve or stop. It ran heavily onto the spear and impaled itself, then crashed into my protector, who dragged it to one side so that it wouldn't fall on me. The wrestling pair collapsed into the dust. The boar struggled weakly to get back to its feet. Lost control of its legs. Grunted feebly. Then died.</p><p>As the dust cleared, strong hands seized the boar lying on top of me and hauled its carcass out of the way. As the hands located my own and helped me to my feet, I squinted and finally realized who'd leapt to my aid - Harkat Mulds!</p><p>The Little Person examined me to make sure no bones were broken, then led me away from the dead boars. Above, the vampires were speechless. Then, as we made for the doors, a couple hissed. Next, a few booed. Soon the entire Hall was filled with the sound of jeers and catcalls. \"Foul!\" they shouted. \"Disgraceful!\" \"Kill them both!\"</p><p>Harkat and I stopped and gazed around, astonished, at the furious vampires. A short while ago they'd been hailing me as a brave-hearted warrior - now they were calling for my blood!</p><p>Not all the vampires were in an uproar. Mr. Crepsley, Gavner, and Kurda didn't raise their voices or demand justice. Nor did Seba, who I spotted sadly shaking his head and turning away.</p><p>As the vampires yelled at us, Vanez Blane stepped over the fence and climbed into the pit. He raised his hands for silence and gradually got it. \"Sire!\" he shouted to Mika Ver Leth, who was standing stone-faced by the fence. \"I'm as appalled by this as any of you. But this wasn't planned and isn't Darren's doing. The Little Person doesn't know our ways and acted on his own. Don't hold this against us, I beg you.\"</p><p>Some of the vampires jeered when they heard that, but Mika Ver Leth waved sharply at them for quiet. \"Darren,\" the Prince said slowly, \"did you plan this with the Little Person?\"</p><p>I shook my head. \"I'm as surprised as anyone,\" I said.</p><p>\"Harkat,\" Mika growled. \"Did you interfere on your own account - or were you obeying orders?\"</p><p>\"No orders,\" Harkat replied. \"Darren my... friend. Couldn't stand by... and watch... him die.\"</p><p>\"You have defied our rules,\" Mika warned him.</p><p>\"Your rules,\" Harkat retorted. \"Not mine. Darren... friend.\"</p><p>The eagle-featured Mika looked troubled and ran a black-gloved finger over his upper lip as he considered the situation.</p><p>\"We must kill them!\" a General shouted angrily. \"We must take both to the Hall of Death and -\"</p><p>\"Would you be so quick to kill Desmond Tiny's messenger?\" Mr. Crepsley interrupted softly. The General who'd called for our heads lapsed into silence. Mr. Crepsley addressed the Hall. \"We must not act hastily. This matter must be taken to the Hall of Princes, where it can be discussed reasonably. Harkat is not a vampire and cannot be judged as one. We do not have the right to pass sentence on him.\"</p><p>\"What about the half-vampire?\" another General spoke up. \"He is subject to our laws. He failed the Trial and must be executed.\"</p><p>\"He didn't fail!\" Kurda shouted. \"The Trial was interrupted. He'd killed one boar - who's to say he wouldn't have killed the other?\"</p><p>\"He was trapped!\" the opposing General bellowed. \"The boar was about to make a fatal charge!\"</p><p>\"Probably,\" Kurda agreed, \"but we'll never know for sure. Darren proved his strength and ingenuity on previous Trials. Perhaps he would have shrugged off the dead boar and avoided the charge at the last moment.\"</p><p>\"Nonsense!\" the General snorted.</p><p>\"Is it?\" Kurda huffed, jumping down into the ring to join me, Harkat, and Vanez. \"Can anyone say for sure that Darren would have lost?\" He spun slowly, meeting the eyes of all in the Hall. \"Can anyone say that he was in a truly hopeless position?\"</p><p>There was a long, uneasy silence, broken in the end by a woman's voice - Arra Sails. \"Kurda's right,\" she said. The vampires shifted uncomfortably - they hadn't expected the likes of Arra to side with Kurda. \"The boy's situation was perilous, but not necessarily fatal. He might have survived.\"</p><p>\"I say Darren has the right to retake the Trial,\" Kurda said, seizing on the uncertain silence that filled the Hall. \"We should adjourn and stage it again, tomorrow.\"</p><p>Everybody looked to Mika Ver Leth for judgment. The Prince brooded on the matter in silence some moments, then glanced at Mr. Crepsley. \"Larten? What do you say about this?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley shrugged grimly. \"It is true that Darren was not actually defeated. But breaking the rules usually means a forfeit. My relationship with Darren forces me to speak for him. Alas, I do not know how to make a case for mercy. Whatever the circumstances, he has failed the Trial.\"</p><p>\"Larten!\" Kurda screeched. \"You don't know what you're saying!\"</p><p>\"Yes, he does,\" I sighed. \"And he's right.\" Pushing Harkat away, I stood by myself and faced Mika Ver Leth. \"I don't think I'd have escaped,\" I said honestly. \"I don't want to die, but I won't ask for any special favors. If it's possible to take the Trial again, I will. If not, I won't complain.\"</p>","<p>An approving murmur ran through the Hall.</p><p>Those who'd been standing angrily by the fence settled back and waited for Mika to make his call. \"You speak like a true vampire,\" the Prince praised me. \"I do not blame you for what happened. Nor do I blame your friend - he is not one of us and cannot be expected to act as we do. There will be no measures taken against Harkat Mulds - that is a guarantee I am willing to make here and now, on my own.\"</p><p>Some of the vampires glared at Harkat, but none raised a voice against him. \"As for your fate,\" Mika said, then hesitated. \"I must speak with my fellow Princes and Generals before passing sentence. I don't think your life can be spared, but Kurda may have a point - perhaps it is possible to take the Trial again. To the best of my knowledge, it has never been permitted, but maybe there's an old law we can fall back on.</p><p>\"Return to your cell,\" Mika said, \"while I and the others consult with our colleagues. You'll be informed of our decision as soon as we reach one. My advice,\" he added in a whisper, \"would be to make your peace with the gods, for I fear you will face them shortly.\"</p><p>I nodded obediently to Mika Ver Leth and kept my head bowed while he and the other vampires filed from the Hall.</p><p>\"I won't let you perish without a fight,\" Kurda promised as he slipped past me. \"You'll get out of this yet, I'm sure of it. There must be a way.\"</p><p>Then he was gone. So were Vanez Blane, Mr. Crepsley, and the rest, leaving just me and Harkat with the dead boars in the pit. Harkat looked shameful when I turned and faced him. \"I did not... mean to... cause trouble,\" he said. \"I acted... before I could... think.\"</p><p>\"Don't worry about it,\" I told him. \"I'd probably have done the same thing if I was in your place. Besides, the worst they can do is kill me - I'd have died anyway if you hadn't leapt to my rescue.\"</p><p>\"You are... not angry?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"Of course not.\" I smiled, and we started for the exit.</p><p>What I didn't say to Harkat was that I wished he had left me to die. At least with the boar, my death would have been fast and easy to face. Now I had a long, nervous wait, which would almost certainly be followed by a gut-wrenching walk to the Hall of Death, where I'd be hoisted above the stakes and subjected to a messy, painful, and humiliating end. It would have been better to die nobly and quickly in the pit.</p><p>Chapter SEVENTEEN</p><p>HARKAT AND I sat on our hammocks and waited. The neighboring cells were deserted, as were the tunnels. Most of the vampires had gathered in the Hall of Princes or were waiting outside for the verdict - vampires loved intrigue almost as much as they loved fighting, and all were anxious to hear the news firsthand.</p><p>\"How come you leapt to my rescue?\" I asked Harkat after a while, to break the nerve-racking silence. \"You might have been killed trying to save me.\"</p><p>\"To be honest,\" Harkat replied sheepishly, \"I acted... for my own sake... not yours. If you die, I might... never find out... who I used... to be.\"</p><p>I laughed. \"You'd better not tell the vampires that. The only reason they've gone lightly on you is that they respect bravery and self-sacrifice. If they learn you did it to save your own skin, there's no telling what they'd do!\"</p><p>\"You do not... mind?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"No.\" I smiled.</p><p>\"If they decide... to kill you, will you... let them?\"</p><p>\"I won't be able to stop them,\" I answered.</p><p>\"But will you... go quietly?\"</p><p>\"I'm not sure,\" I sighed. \"If they'd taken me right after the fight, I'd have gone without a murmur - I was pumped up with adrenaline and wasn't scared of dying. Now that I've calmed down, I'm dreading it. I hope I'll go with my head held high, but I'm afraid I'll cry and beg for mercy.\"</p><p>\"Not you,\" Harkat said. \"You're too... tough.\"</p><p>\"You think?\" I laughed dryly.</p><p>\"You fought... boars and faced... fire and water. You didn't... show fear before. Why should... you now?\"</p><p>\"That was different,\" I said. \"I had a fighting chance. If they decide to kill me, I'll have to walk to the Hall of Death knowing it's all over.\"</p><p>\"Don't worry,\" Harkat said. \"If you do... die, maybe you... will come back... as a Little... Person.\"</p><p>I stared at Harkat's misshapen body, his scarred, disfigured face, his green eyes, and the mask he couldn't survive without. \"Oh, that's a great comfort,\" I said sarcastically.</p><p>\"Just trying... to cheer you up.\"</p><p>\"Well, don't!\"</p><p>Minutes trickled by agonizingly. I wished the vampires would reach their decision quickly, even if it meant death - anything would be better than sitting here, not knowing. Finally, after what felt like a lifetime, there came the sound of feet in the tunnel outside. Harkat and I tensed, rolled off our hammocks, and jumped to attention by the door of the cell. We glanced nervously at each other. Harkat grinned weakly. My grin was even weaker.</p><p>\"Here we go,\" I whispered.</p><p>\"Good luck,\" he replied.</p><p>The footsteps slowed, stopped, then came again, softly. A vampire emerged from the gloom of the tunnel and slid into the cell - Kurda.</p><p>\"What's happening?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I came to see how you were doing,\" he said, smiling crookedly.</p><p>\"Fine!\" I snapped. \"Just dandy. Couldn't be better.\"</p><p>\"I thought as much.\" He looked around twitchily.</p><p>\"Have they... decided yet?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"No. But it won't be long. They...\" - He cleared his throat - \"They're going to demand your death, Darren.\"</p><p>I'd been expecting it, but it hit me hard all the same. I took a step backwards, and my knees buckled. If Harkat hadn't caught and steadied me, I would have fallen.</p><p>\"I've tried arguing them out of it,\" Kurda said. \"Others have too - Gavner and Vanez put their careers on the line to plead for you. But there aren't any precedents. The laws are clear - failure to complete the Trials must be punished with death. We tried convincing the Princes to let you take the Trial again, but they turned a deaf ear to our pleas.\"</p><p>\"So why haven't they come for me?\" I asked.</p><p>\"They're still debating. Larten's been calling older vampires forward and asking if they ever heard of something like this happening before. He's trying hard for you. If there's the slightest legal loophole, he'll find it.\"</p><p>\"But there isn't, is there?\" I asked glumly.</p><p>Kurda shook his head. \"If Paris Skyle knows of no way to save you, I'm sure none of the others do either. If he can't help you, I doubt that anyone can.\"</p><p>\"So it's over. I'm finished.\"</p><p>\"Not necessarily,\" Kurda said, averting his eyes, strangely embarrassed.</p><p>\"I don't understand.\" I frowned. \"You just said -\"</p><p>\"The verdict's inevitable,\" he interrupted. \"That doesn't mean you have to stay and face it.\"</p><p>\"Kurda!\" I gasped, appalled by what he was saying.</p><p>\"You can get out,\" he whispered. \"I know a way past the guards, a breach point I never informed anybody about. We can take rarely used tunnels down through the mountain, to save time. Dawn isn't far off. Once you get out in the open, you'll have a free run until dusk. Even then, I don't think anybody will come after you. Since you don't pose a threat, they'll let you go. They might kill you if they run into you later, but for the time being -\"</p><p>\"I couldn't do that,\" I interrupted. \"Mr. Crepsley would be ashamed of me. I'm his assistant. He'd have to answer for it.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Kurda said. \"You're not his responsibility, not since you embarked on the Trials. People might say things behind his back, but nobody would question his good name out in the open.\"</p><p>\"I couldn't,\" I said again, with less conviction this time. \"What about you? If they found out you'd helped me escape...\"</p><p>\"They won't,\" Kurda said. \"I'll cover my tracks. As long as you aren't caught, I'll be fine.\"</p><p>\"And if I am caught, and they worm the truth out of me?\"</p><p>Kurda shrugged. \"I'll take that chance.\"</p><p>I hesitated, torn by uncertainty. The vampire part of me wanted to stay and take what I had coming. The human part said not to be a fool, grab my opportunity and run.</p><p>\"You're young, Darren,\" Kurda said. \"It's crazy to throw your life away. Leave Vampire Mountain. Make a fresh start. You're experienced enough to survive on your own. You don't need Larten to look after you anymore. Lots of vampires lead their own lives, having nothing to do with the rest of us. Be your own person. Don't let the foolish pride of others cloud your judgment.\"</p><p>\"What do you think?\" I asked Harkat.</p><p>\"I think... Kurda's right,\" he said. \"No point... letting them kill... you. Go. Live. Be free. I will... come with you... and help. Later, maybe you... can help me.\"</p><p>\"Harkat won't be able to come,\" Kurda said. \"He's too broad to fit through some of the tunnels I plan to use. You can arrange to meet somewhere else, when Council is over and he's free to leave without drawing suspicion to himself.\"</p><p>\"The Cirque... Du Freak,\" Harkat said. \"You'll be able... to find it?\"</p><p>I nodded. I'd gotten to know a lot of people around the world during my years with the Cirque, people who assisted Mr. Tall and his colleagues when they came to town. They'd be able to point me in the direction of the traveling circus.</p><p>\"Have you decided?\" Kurda asked. \"There's no time to stand and debate the issue. Come with me now, or stay to face your death.\"</p><p>I gulped deeply, stared at my feet, came to a decision, then locked gazes with Kurda and said, \"I'll come.\" I wasn't proud of myself, but shame was a lot sweeter than the sharpened stakes in the Hall of Death.</p><p>Chapter EIGHTEEN</p><p>WE HURRIED through the deserted corridors, down to the storerooms. Kurda led me to the back of one, where we moved aside a couple of large sacks, revealing a small hole in the wall. Kurda began to squeeze through, but I pulled him back and asked if we could rest for a couple of minutes - I was in a lot of pain.</p><p>\"Will you be able to continue?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Yes, but only if we stop for regular breaks. I know time is precious, but I'm too exhausted to keep going without resting.\"</p><p>When I felt ready, I followed Kurda through the hole and found myself in a cramped tunnel that dropped sharply. I suggested we slide to the bottom, but Kurda rejected the idea. \"We're not going all the way down,\" he said. \"There's a shelf halfway down this hole that leads to another tunnel.\"</p><p>Sure enough, after several minutes we came to a ledge, left the hole, and were soon back on level ground. \"How did you find this place?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I followed a bat,\" he said, and winked.</p><p>We came to a fork, and Kurda stopped to get out a map. He studied it silently for a few seconds, then took the turn to the left.</p><p>\"Are you sure you know where you're going?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Not entirely.\" He laughed. \"That's why I brought my maps. I haven't been down some of these tunnels in decades.\"</p><p>I tried keeping track of the route we were taking, in case anything happened to Kurda, and I had to find my way back on my own, but it was impossible. We twisted and turned so many times, only a genius could have memorized the way.</p><p>We passed over a couple of small streams. Kurda told me that they joined up with others farther ahead, to form the wide stream that had been used for burying the dead in the past. \"We could always swim to safety,\" I suggested jokingly.</p><p>\"Why not flap our arms and fly away while we're at it?\" Kurda replied.</p><p>Some of the tunnels were pitch black, but Kurda didn't light any candles - he said the wax droppings would mark our trail and make it easy for pursuing vampires to track us.</p><p>The farther we progressed, the harder it became for me to keep up, and we had to stop often so I could catch my breath and work up the energy to continue.</p><p>\"I'd carry you if there was room,\" Kurda said during one of our rest periods, wiping sweat and blood from my neck and shoulders with his shirt. \"We'll be entering larger tunnels shortly. I can give you a boost then if you'd like.\"</p><p>\"That'd be great,\" I wheezed.</p><p>\"What about when we get out of the tunnels?\" he asked. \"Do you want me to come with you some of the way, to make sure you're OK?\"</p><p>I shook my head. \"You'd be discovered by the Generals if you did. I'll be fine once I get outside. The fresh air will perk me up. I'll find somewhere to sleep, rest for a few hours, then -\"</p><p>I stopped. Loose pebbles had clattered to the floor in one of the tunnels behind us. Kurda heard them too. He ran to the mouth of the tunnel and squatted by the opening, listening intently. After a few seconds, he raced back to my side. \"Someone's coming!\" he hissed, dragging me to my feet. \"Hurry! We must get out of here!\"</p><p>\"No,\" I sighed, sitting down again.</p><p>\"Darren!\" he screeched softly. \"You can't stay. We've got to make a break for it before -\"</p><p>\"I can't,\" I told him. \"Shuffling was hard enough - there's no way I can take part in a full-speed chase. If we've been found, that's the end. Go on ahead and hide. I'll pretend I acted alone.\"</p><p>\"You know I wouldn't leave you,\" he said, squatting beside me.</p><p>We waited in silence as the footsteps came closer. By the sound, there was only one person following us. I hoped it wasn't Mr. Crepsley - I dreaded the thought of facing him after what I'd done.</p>","<p>The tracking vampire reached the mouth of the tunnel, studied us from the shadows a moment, then ducked forward and hurried over. It was Gavner Purl! \"You two are in so much trouble,\" he snarled. \"Whose dumb idea was it to run?\"</p><p>\"Mine!\" Kurda and I said at the exact same time.</p><p>Gavner shook his head, exasperated. \"You're as bad as each other,\" he snapped. \"Come on - the truth.\"</p><p>\"It was my idea,\" Kurda answered, squeezing my arm to silence my protestations. \"I persuaded Darren to come. The blame is mine.\"</p><p>\"You're an idiot,\" Gavner reprimanded him. \"This will destroy you if word gets out. You won't just have to forget about becoming a Vampire Prince - chances are you'll be carted off to the Hall of Death to suffer the same fate as Darren.\"</p><p>\"Only if you tell on me,\" Kurda said quietly.</p><p>\"You think I won't?\" Gavner challenged him.</p><p>\"If it was your intention to punish us, you wouldn't have come alone.\"</p><p>Gavner stared at the senior vampire, then cursed shortly. \"You're right,\" he groaned. \"I don't want to see you killed. If the two of you come back with me, I'll keep your name out of it. In fact, nobody ever need know it happened. Harkat and I are the only ones who know at the moment. We can get Darren back before judgment is passed.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" Kurda asked. \"So he can be taken to the Hall of Death and impaled?\"</p><p>\"If that's the judgment of the Princes - yes,\" Gavner said.</p><p>Kurda shook his head. \"That's what we're escaping from. I won't let him go back to be killed. It's wrong to take a boy's life in such a heartless fashion.\"</p><p>\"Wrong or right,\" Gavner snapped, \"the judgment of the Princes is final!\"</p><p>Kurda narrowed his eyes. \"You agree with me,\" he whispered. \"You think his life should be spared.\"</p><p>Gavner nodded reluctantly. \"But that's my own opinion. I'm not going to ignore the ruling of the Princes.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\" Kurda asked. \"Do we have to obey them even when they're wrong, even when they rule unjustly?\"</p><p>\"It's our way,\" Gavner growled.</p><p>\"Ways can be changed,\" Kurda insisted. \"The Princes are too inflexible. They ignore the fact that the world is moving forward. In a few weeks, I'll be a Prince. I can change things. Let Darren go, and I'll get the ruling against him overturned. I'll clear his name and allow him to return and complete his Trials. Turn a blind eye just this once and I swear you won't regret it.\"</p><p>Gavner was troubled by Kurda's words. \"It's wrong to plot against the Princes,\" he muttered.</p><p>\"Nobody will know,\" Kurda promised. \"They'll think Darren got away by himself. We'll never be investigated.\"</p><p>\"It goes against everything we believe in,\" Gavner sighed.</p><p>\"Sometimes we have to abandon old beliefs in favor of new ones,\" Kurda said.</p><p>While Gavner agonized over his decision, I spoke up. \"I'll go back if you want me to. I'm afraid of dying, which is why I let Kurda talk me into fleeing. But if you say I should return, I will.\"</p><p>\"I don't want you to die,\" Gavner cried. \"But running away never solved anything.\"</p><p>\"Nonsense!\" Kurda snorted. \"Vampires would be a lot better off if more of us had the good sense to run from a fight when the odds are stacked against us. If we take Darren back, we take him back to die. Where's the sense in that?\"</p><p>Gavner thought it over in silence, then nodded morosely. \"I don't like it, but it's the lesser of two evils. I won't turn you in. But,\" he added, \"only if you agree to present the truth to the others once you become a Prince. We'll come clean, clear Darren's name if we can, accept our punishment if we can't. OK?\"</p><p>\"That's fine by me,\" Kurda said.</p><p>\"Your word on it?\"</p><p>Kurda nodded. \"My word.\"</p><p>Gavner let out a long breath and studied me in the gloom of the tunnel. \"How are you anyway?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Not so bad,\" I lied.</p><p>\"You look like you're about to drop,\" he noted skeptically.</p><p>\"I'll make it,\" I vowed. Then I asked how he'd found us.</p><p>\"I went looking for Kurda,\" he explained. \"I was hoping we could put our heads together and figure a way out of this mess. His map cabinet was open. I didn't think anything of it at the time, but when I dropped by your cell and found Harkat there by himself, I put two and two together.\"</p><p>\"How did you track us through the tunnels?\" Kurda asked.</p><p>Gavner pointed to a drop of blood on the floor beneath me. \"He's been dripping the whole way,\" he said. \"He's left a trail even a fool could follow.\"</p><p>Kurda closed his eyes and grimaced. \"Charna's guts! Espionage never was my strong suit.\"</p><p>\"You're right!\" Gavner snorted. \"If we're going to pull this off, we'd better move quickly. As soon as Darren's discovered missing, there'll be a team of trackers on his trail, and it won't take them long to find him. Our only chance is to get him outside and hope the sun prevents them from continuing.\"</p><p>\"My thoughts exactly,\" Kurda said, and started ahead. I followed as well as I could, Gavner puffing along behind.</p><p>At the end of the tunnel, Kurda turned left. I headed after him, but Gavner grabbed my arm and stopped me, then studied the tunnel to his right. When Kurda realized we weren't at his heels, he paused and looked back. \"What's the delay?\" he asked.</p><p>\"I've been in this part of the mountain before,\"</p><p>Gavner said. \"It was during my Trials of Initiation. I had to find a hidden jewel.\"</p><p>\"So?\"</p><p>\"I can find the way out,\" Gavner said. \"I know the path to the nearest exit.\"</p><p>\"So do I,\" Kurda said, \"and it's this way.\"</p><p>Gavner shook his head. \"We can get out that way,\" he agreed, \"but it'll be quicker if we take this other tunnel.\"</p><p>\"No!\" Kurda snapped. \"This was my idea. I'm in charge. We don't have time to go wandering around. If you're wrong, it'll cost us. My way is certain.\"</p><p>\"So's mine,\" Gavner insisted, and before Kurda could object, he ducked down the tunnel to the right, dragging me along after him. Kurda cursed loudly and called us back, but when Gavner ignored him, he had no choice other than to hurry after us.</p><p>\"This is stupid,\" Kurda panted when he caught up. He tried to squeeze past me to deal with Gavner face-to-face, but the tunnel was too narrow. \"We should stick to the route on the maps. I know more about these tunnels than you. There's nothing the way you're going except dead ends.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Gavner contradicted him. \"We can save almost forty minutes this way.\"</p><p>\"But what if -,\" Kurda began.</p><p>\"Stop arguing,\" Gavner interrupted. \"The more we talk, the slower we progress.\"</p><p>Kurda muttered something, but said no more about it. I could tell he wasn't happy though.</p><p>We passed through a small tunnel that cut beneath a roaring mountain stream. The water sounded so close, I was afraid it might break through the walls of the tunnel and flood us. I couldn't hear anything over the noise of the stream, and it was so dark, I couldn't see anything either. It felt as if I was all alone.</p><p>I was delighted to finally see light at the end, and hurried towards it as fast as I could. Gavner and Kurda also moved quickly, so they must have been anxious to escape the tunnel too. As we brushed the dirt from the tunnel off ourselves, Kurda moved ahead and took the lead. We were in a small cave. There were three tunnels leading out of it. Kurda went to the tunnel on the far left. \"We're taking this one,\" he said, re-exerting his authority.</p><p>Gavner grinned. \"That's the one I planned to take anyway.\"</p><p>\"Then hurry up,\" Kurda snapped.</p><p>\"What's wrong with you?\" Gavner asked. \"You're acting oddly.\"</p><p>\"No, I'm not!\" Kurda glared, then smiled weakly. \"Sorry. It's that tunnel under the stream. I knew we'd have to pass through it. That's why I wanted to go the other way - to avoid it.\"</p><p>\"Afraid the water would break through?\" Gavner laughed.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Kurda answered stiffly.</p><p>\"I was afraid too,\" I said. \"I wouldn't like to crawl through a place like that too often.\"</p><p>\"Cowards.\" Gavner chuckled. He started towards Kurda, smiling, then stopped and turned his head sideways.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I thought I heard something,\" he said.</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"It sounded like someone coughing. It came from the tunnel to the right.\"</p><p>\"A search party?\" I asked worriedly.</p><p>Gavner frowned. \"I doubt it - they'd be coming from behind.\"</p><p>\"What's going on?\" Kurda asked impatiently.</p><p>\"Gavner thinks he heard something,\" I said as the General crept across to explore the tunnel.</p><p>\"It's just the sound of the stream,\" Kurda said. \"We don't have time to -\"</p><p>But it was too late. Gavner had already entered the tunnel. Kurda hurried over to where I was standing and peered into the darkness of the tunnel after Gavner. \"We'd be better off on our own,\" he grumbled. \"He's done nothing but slow us down.\"</p><p>\"What if somebody's in there?\" I asked.</p><p>\"There's nobody down here besides us,\" Kurda snorted. \"We should head on without that fool and leave him to catch up.\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said, \"I'd rather wait.\"</p><p>Kurda rolled his eyes but stood sullenly beside me. Gavner was gone no more than a couple of minutes, but when he returned he looked years older. His legs were shaking, and he sank to his bottom as soon as he emerged from the tunnel.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" I asked.</p><p>He shook his head wordlessly.</p><p>\"You found something?\" Kurda asked.</p><p>\"There's...\" Gavner cleared his throat. \"Go look,\" he whispered. \"But be careful. Don't be seen.\"</p><p>\"Seen by who?\" I asked, but he didn't answer.</p><p>Curious, I crept along the tunnel, Kurda right behind me. It was short, and as I approached the end, I noticed the flicker of torches in a large cave beyond. I dropped to my stomach, then edged forward so that I had a clear view of the cave. What I saw froze my guts inside me.</p><p>Twenty or thirty people were lounging around. Some were sitting, some lying on mats, some playing cards. They had the general appearance of vampires - bulky, rough features, crude haircuts. But I could see their purplish skin and reddish hair and eyes, and I identified them immediately - our blood foes, the vampaneze!</p><p>Chapter NINETEEN</p><p>KURDA AND I retreated slowly and joined Gavner in the smaller cave. We sat next to him and nobody said anything for a while. Finally Gavner spoke in a dull, distracted tone. \"I counted thirty-four of them.\"</p><p>\"There were thirty-five when we looked,\" Kurda said.</p><p>\"There are two adjoining caves of similar size,\" Gavner noted. \"There might be more in those.\"</p><p>\"What are they doing here?\" I asked in a whisper.</p><p>The vampires trained their sights on me.</p><p>\"Why do you think they're here?\" Gavner asked.</p><p>I licked my lips nervously. \"To attack us?\" I guessed.</p><p>\"You got it,\" Gavner said grimly.</p><p>\"Not necessarily,\" Kurda said. \"They might have come to discuss a treaty.\"</p><p>\"You think so?\" Gavner sneered.</p><p>\"No,\" Kurda sighed. \"Not really.\"</p><p>\"We have to warn the vampires,\" I said.</p><p>Kurda nodded. \"But what about your escape? One of us can lead you to -\"</p><p>\"Forget it,\" I interrupted. \"I'm not running away from something like this.\"</p><p>\"Come on then,\" Kurda said, getting to his feet and making for the tunnel under the stream. \"The quicker we tell the others, the quicker we can return and -\" He was bending down to enter the tunnel, but stopped suddenly and spun to the side. Signaling us to stay where we were, he peered cautiously into the tunnel, then raced back. \"Somebody's coming!\" he hissed.</p><p>\"Vampires or vampaneze?\" Gavner asked.</p><p>\"Too dark to tell. Think we can afford to wait and find out?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Gavner said. \"We've got to get out of here.\" He studied the three exit tunnels. \"We can get back to the Halls by the middle tunnel, but it'll take a lot of time. If they spot Darren's trail of blood and come after us...\"</p><p>\"We'll take the left tunnel,\" Kurda said.</p><p>\"That doesn't lead up.\" Gavner frowned.</p><p>\"According to my maps, it does,\" Kurda contradicted him. \"There's a very small connecting tunnel, easy to miss. I only found it by chance.\"</p><p>\"You're sure?\" Gavner asked.</p><p>\"Maps don't lie,\" Kurda said.</p><p>\"Then let's go,\" Gavner decided, and off we dashed.</p><p>I forgot about my pain as we sped through the tunnels. There was no time to worry about myself. The entire vampire clan was under threat, and all I thought about was getting back to the Hall of Princes and tipping them off.</p><p>When we reached Kurda's connecting tunnel, we discovered a cave-in. We stared at the pile of rocks, dismayed, then Kurda swore and kicked angrily at the blockage.</p><p>\"I'm sorry,\" he sighed.</p><p>\"It's not your fault,\" Gavner told him. \"You couldn't have known.\"</p><p>\"Where do we go now?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Back through the cave?\" Gavner suggested.</p>","<p>Kurda shook his head. \"If we've been discovered, they'll come after us that way. There's another tunnel we can use. It'll take us back in the same direction, and it links up with tunnels leading to the Halls.\"</p><p>\"Let's go then,\" Gavner barked, and we followed after Kurda as he led the way through the dark.</p><p>We spoke as little as possible, pausing occasionally to listen for sounds of pursuit. There weren't any, but that didn't mean we weren't being hunted - vampaneze can move as silently as vampires when they wish.</p><p>After a while, Kurda came to a stop and pressed his head close to ours. \"We're right behind the cave where the vampaneze are,\" he whispered. \"Move slowly and carefully. If they spot us, fight for your lives - then run like hell!\"</p><p>\"Wait,\" I said. \"I don't have a weapon. I'll need one if we're attacked.\"</p><p>\"I only have one knife,\" Kurda said. \"Gavner?\"</p><p>\"I have two, but I'll need both of them.\"</p><p>\"So what will I fight with?\" I hissed. \"Bad breath?\"</p><p>Gavner grinned grimly. \"No offense, Darren, but if Kurda and I can't fend them off, I don't think you can make much of a difference. If we run into trouble, grab Kurda's maps and head for the Halls while we stay and fight.\"</p><p>\"I couldn't do that,\" I gasped.</p><p>\"You'll do as you're told,\" Gavner growled, leaving no room for argument.</p><p>We started forward again, softer than ever. Sounds from the cave reached our ears - vampaneze laughing and talking quietly. If I'd been alone, I might have panicked and bolted, but Kurda and Gavner were made of sterner stuff, and their calm presence held me in check.</p><p>Our luck held until we turned into a long tunnel and ran into a lone vampaneze, walking towards us, fiddling with his belt. He glanced up casually as we froze, saw in an instant that we weren't vampaneze, and opened his mouth to roar.</p><p>Gavner darted forward, knives flashing. He stuck one deep into the vampaneze's belly and slashed the other across his throat before he could make a sound and alert his companions. It had been a close call, and we were all smiling weakly with relief as Gavner laid the dead body on the ground. But as we were about to move on, another vampaneze appeared at the far end of the tunnel, saw us, and yelled for help.</p><p>Gavner groaned desolately. \"So much for stealth,\" he muttered as vampaneze poured in from the cavern. He took a firm stand in the middle of the tunnel, checked the walls on each side, then spoke over his shoulder. \"You two get out of here. I'll delay them as long as I can.\"</p><p>\"I won't leave you to face them alone,\" Kurda said.</p><p>\"You will if you have any brains,\" Gavner snarled.</p><p>\"This tunnel's narrow. One person can hold them off as easily as two. Take Darren and break for the Halls, as fast as you can.\"</p><p>\"But -,\" Kurda started to say.</p><p>\"You're arguing our chances away!\" Gavner roared, flicking a knife at one of the nearest vampaneze, forcing him back. \"Move that dead vampaneze from behind me, so I don't trip over him - and run!\"</p><p>Kurda nodded sadly. \"Luck, Gavner Purl,\" he said.</p><p>\"Luck,\" Gavner grunted, and made another attack.</p><p>We dragged the dead body out of Gavner's way and retreated to the mouth of the tunnel. Kurda paused there and studied Gavner in silence as he sliced at the vampaneze with his pair of knives. He was keeping them at arm's length, but it would be only a matter of minutes before they swarmed over him, took his weapons, and killed him.</p><p>Kurda turned to lead me away, then stopped and dug out a map. \"Do you remember the old burial chamber we visited?\" he asked. \"The Hall of Final Voyage?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said.</p><p>\"Do you think you could find your way back to the Halls from it?\"</p><p>\"Probably.\"</p><p>He stuck the map away and pointed down the tunnel we were in. \"Go to the end of this,\" he said. \"Take a right, another right, then four lefts. That'll bring you to the chamber. Wait a few minutes in case one of us comes. Get your breath back. Try rebandaging yourself so that you stop dripping blood. Then go.\"</p><p>\"What are you going to do?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Help Gavner.\"</p><p>\"But he said -\"</p><p>\"I know what he said!\" Kurda snapped. \"I don't care. Two of us working together stand a better chance of holding them.\" Kurda gripped my shoulders and squeezed tightly. \"Luck, Darren Shan.\"</p><p>\"Luck,\" I replied miserably.</p><p>\"Don't stay and watch,\" he said. \"Leave immediately.\"</p><p>\"OK,\" I agreed, and slipped away.</p><p>I got as far as the second right turn before I stopped. I knew I should do as Kurda said and flee for the Halls, but I couldn't bear the thought of leaving my friends behind. They were in this mess because of me. It would have been unfair to leave them to face death while I waltzed away scot-free. Somebody had to warn the vampires, but I didn't think it should be me. If I told Kurda I'd forgotten the way back, he'd have to go himself, meaning I could stay and fight beside Gavner.</p><p>I backtracked to the tunnel where the fighting was raging. When I got there, I saw that Gavner was still holding the vampaneze off single-handedly. Kurda hadn't been able to move forward. The two were arguing. \"I told you to leave!\" Gavner roared.</p><p>\"And I'm telling you I won't!\" Kurda shrieked back.</p><p>\"What about Darren?\"</p><p>\"I gave him directions to get back.\"</p><p>\"You're a fool, Kurda,\" Gavner shouted.</p><p>\"I know,\" Kurda laughed. \"Now, are you going to let me in for a piece of this, or do I have to fight you as well as the vampaneze?\"</p><p>Gavner stabbed at a vampaneze who had a round, dark red birthmark on his left cheek, then dropped back a few steps. \"OK,\" he grunted. \"The next time there's a break in the fighting, move up to my right.\"</p><p>\"Agreed,\" Kurda said, and held his knife tightly by his side while he waited.</p><p>I crept forward. I didn't want to yell and distract them. I was almost upon them when the vampaneze fell back several feet and Gavner shouted, \"Now!\"</p><p>Gavner edged to his left, and Kurda moved forward, filling the space beside him. I realized it was too late for me to take Kurda's place, so I started to turn away reluctantly. As I did, something crazy happened that stopped me dead in my tracks and held me rooted to the spot.</p><p>As Kurda stepped up beside Gavner, he raised his knife high and swung it down in a vicious arc. It cut deep into the belly of its intended target, slicing open the flesh, ensuring death. It would have been a lovely stroke to behold if it had been directed at one of the vampaneze. But Kurda hadn't stuck the blade into any of the purple-skinned invaders - he'd stuck it into Gavner Purl!</p><p>Chapter TWENTY</p><p>I COULDN'T understand what was happening. Neither could Gavner. He slumped against the wall and stared at the knife sticking out of his belly. He dropped his own knives, gripped the handle, and tried to pull it out, but his strength deserted him, and he slid to the floor.</p><p>Though Gavner and I were shocked, the vampaneze didn't seem the least bit surprised. They relaxed, and those at the rear returned to their cave. The one with the red birthmark on his cheek stepped forward, stood beside Kurda, and studied the dying vampire. \"I thought for a minute you were coming to his aid,\" the vampaneze said.</p><p>\"No,\" Kurda replied. He sounded mournful. \"I'd have knocked him out and taken him away somewhere if possible, but others could have tracked down his mental signals. There's a boy up ahead, a half-vampire. He's injured, so he won't be hard to catch. I want him taken alive. They won't be able to track him.\"</p><p>\"Do you mean the boy behind you?\" the vampaneze asked.</p><p>Kurda swiveled sharply. \"Darren!\" he gasped. \"How long have you been there? How much have you -\"</p><p>Gavner groaned. I jolted into action, ducked forward, ignored Kurda and the vampaneze, and crouched beside my dying friend. His eyes were wide open but he didn't seem to see anything. \"Gavner?\" I asked, holding his hands, which were bloody from trying to take out the knife. The Vampire General coughed and trembled. I could feel the life slipping out of him. \"I'm with you, Gavner,\" I whispered, crying. \"You're not alone. I'll -\"</p><p>\"Suh-suh-suh,\" he stuttered.</p><p>\"What is it?\" I wept. \"Don't hurry. You've got plenty of time.\" That was a barefaced lie.</p><p>\"Suh-sorry if muh-muh-my snoring... kuh-kept you... awake,\" he wheezed. I didn't know if the words were meant for me or someone else, and before I could ask, his expression froze on his face, and his spirit passed on to Paradise.</p><p>I pressed my forehead to Gavner's and howled pitifully, clutching his dead body to mine. The vampaneze could have taken me easily then, but they were embarrassed, and nobody moved forward to capture me. They just stood around, waiting for me to stop crying.</p><p>When I finally raised my head, nobody dared meet my gaze. All eyes dropped to the floor, Kurda's quickest of all. \"You killed him!\" I hissed.</p><p>Kurda gulped deeply. \"I had to,\" he croaked. \"There was no time to let him die a noble death - you might have gotten away if I'd left him for the vampaneze.\"</p><p>\"You knew they were here all along,\" I whispered.</p><p>He nodded. \"That's why I didn't want to take the route under the stream,\" he said. \"I feared this would happen. Everything would have been OK if we'd gone the way I wanted.\"</p><p>\"You're in league with them!\" I shouted. \"You're a traitor!\"</p><p>\"You don't understand what's happening,\" he sighed. \"This looks terrible, but it's not what you think. I'm trying to save our race, not condemn it. There are things you don't know - things no vampire knows. Gavner's death is regrettable, but when I explain prop-\"</p><p>\"The hell with your explanations!\" I screamed. \"You're a traitor and a murderer - scum!\"</p><p>\"I saved your life,\" Kurda reminded me gently.</p><p>\"At the expense of Gavner's,\" I sobbed. \"Why did you do it? He was your friend. He...\" I shook my head and stopped myself before he could answer. \"Never mind. I don't want to hear.\" Stooping, I picked up one of Gavner's knives and brandished it in front of me. The vampaneze raised their weapons immediately and closed in.</p><p>\"No!\" Kurda shouted, stepping in their way. \"I said I wanted him taken alive!\"</p><p>\"He has a knife,\" the vampaneze with the birthmark growled. \"Do you want us to let him chop off our fingers while we get it away from him?\"</p><p>\"Don't worry, Glalda,\" Kurda said. \"I'm in control of the situation.\" Dropping his knife, he spread his hands and walked slowly towards me.</p><p>\"Stop!\" I yelled. \"Don't come any closer!\"</p><p>\"I'm unarmed,\" he said.</p><p>\"I don't care. I'll kill you anyway. You deserve it.\"</p><p>\"Maybe so,\" Kurda agreed, \"but I don't think you'd kill an unarmed man, no matter what he'd done. If I'm wrong, I'll pay for my error of judgment in the severest way possible - but I don't think I am.\"</p><p>I drew back the knife to stab him, then lowered my hand. He was right - even though he'd killed Gavner in cold blood, I couldn't bring myself to do the same.</p><p>\"I hate you!\" I cried, then threw my knife at him. As he ducked, I spun and sped back up the tunnel, turned right, and fled.</p><p>As the vampaneze surged after me, I heard Kurda roaring at them not to harm me. He told them I was injured and couldn't get far. One roared back that he was cutting ahead with a few others to block off the tunnels leading to the Halls. Another wanted to know if I was carrying any other weapons.</p><p>Then I passed out of earshot of the enemies and the traitor and was racing through darkness, fleeing blindly, crying for my sacrificed friend - the poor, dead Gavner Purl.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-ONE</p><p>THE VAMPANEZE took their time hunting me down. They knew I couldn't escape. I was injured and tired, so all they had to do was stay close and slowly reel me in. As I scurried and twisted through the tunnels, the roar of the mountain stream increased, and I realized my feet were guiding me to the old burial chamber. I thought about changing direction, to outwit Kurda, but I'd lose my way if I did and never make it back to the Halls. My only chance was to take the paths I was familiar with and hope I could block one off by bringing down the ceiling behind me.</p><p>I burst into the Hall of Final Voyage and paused to catch my breath. I could hear the sounds of the vampaneze behind. They were far too close for comfort. I needed to rest but there was no time. Struggling to my feet, I looked for the way out.</p><p>At first the cave seemed unfamiliar, and I wondered if I'd possibly wandered into the wrong one by mistake. Then it struck me that I was simply on the side of the stream opposite where I'd been before. Advancing to the edge of the bank, I looked across and saw the tunnel I needed to leave by. I also saw a very pale-skinned person with white eyes and rags for clothes, sitting on a rock close to the wall - a Guardian of the Blood!</p><p>\"Help,\" I shouted, startling the thin man, who leapt to his feet and squinted at me. \"Vampaneze!\" I croaked. \"They've invaded the mountain. You've got to warn the Generals!\"</p><p>The Guardian's eyes narrowed, and he shook his head, then said something in a language I didn't understand. I opened my mouth to repeat the warning, but before I could, he made a sign with his fingers, shook his head again, and slipped out of the cave, disappearing swiftly into the shadows of the tunnel beyond.</p><p>I cursed - the Guardians of the Blood must also be in league with the vampaneze! - then glanced down into the dark water at my feet and shivered. The stream wasn't particularly wide, and I could have jumped it with ease any other time. But I was exhausted, aching, and desperate. All I wanted to do was lie down and let the vampaneze have me. Going on seemed pointless. They were sure to catch me. It would be a lot easier to surrender now and...</p>","<p>\"No!\" I shouted aloud. They killed Gavner, and they'd kill the rest of the vampires - including Mr. Crepsley - if I couldn't get to the Halls first and stop them. I had to go on. I took a few steps back, preparing for the jump. Looking over my shoulder, I saw the first of the vampaneze enter the cave. I backed up a few more steps, then raced to the edge of the bank and leapt.</p><p>I knew immediately that I wasn't going to make it. There hadn't been enough pace or spring in my step. I flailed out with my arms, in the hope of catching hold of the ledge, but fell several feet shy of safety and dropped into the freezing water of the stream.</p><p>The current caught me instantly. By the time I bobbed to the surface, the mouth of the tunnel leading out of the cave and back underground was almost upon me. I threw out my arms, terrified, and caught hold of a rock jutting out of the bank. Using the last of my strength, I clawed my way to partial safety. Defying the flow of the water, I half-flopped onto the rock and grabbed hold of some deep-rooted weeds.</p><p>It was a perilous position, but I might have been able to scrape my way out of it - if not for the dozen or so vampaneze who'd crossed the stream and were standing overhead, arms folded, waiting patiently. One lit a cigarette, then flicked his match at my face. It missed, hit the water, quenched with a hiss, and disappeared at a frightening speed down the dark tunnel into the mountain.</p><p>As I clung to the rock, frozen and soaking, wondering what to do, Kurda pushed his way through the vampaneze and dropped to his knees. He extended a hand to help me up, but couldn't reach. \"Somebody grab my ankles and lower me,\" he said.</p><p>\"Why?\" the vampaneze named Glalda asked. \"Let him drown. It'll be easier.\"</p><p>\"No!\" Kurda barked. \"His death serves no purpose. He's young and open to new ideas. We'll need vampires like him if we're going to -\"</p><p>\"OK, OK,\" Glalda sighed, and signaled two of his men to take Kurda's legs and lower him over the edge, so that he could rescue me.</p><p>I stared at Kurda's hands as they stretched towards my own, then at his face, mere inches away. \"You killed Gavner,\" I snarled.</p><p>\"We'll discuss that later,\" he said, snatching at my wrists.</p><p>I pulled my hands out of his way and spat on his fingers, even though I nearly fell back into the water. I couldn't bear the thought of him touching me. \"Why did you do it?\" I moaned.</p><p>Kurda shook his head. \"It's too complicated. Come with me and I'll explain later. When you're safe, dry, and fed, I'll sit you down and -\"</p><p>\"Don't touch me!\" I screeched as he reached for me again.</p><p>\"Don't be stupid,\" he said. \"You're in no position to argue. Take my hand and let me pull you to safety. You won't be harmed, I promise.\"</p><p>\"You promise,\" I sneered. \"Your word means nothing. You're a liar and a traitor. I wouldn't believe you if you said the world was round.\"</p><p>\"Believe what you want,\" he snapped, \"but I'm all that stands between you and a watery grave, so you can't afford to be picky. Take my hand and stop acting like an idiot.\"</p><p>\"You have no clue,\" I said, shaking my head in disgust. \"You don't know a thing about honor or loyalty. I'd rather die than give myself up to scum like you.\"</p><p>\"Don't be -,\" Kurda started to say, but before he could finish, I released my grip on the rock, pushed backwards with my legs, and let the water have me. \"Darren - no!\" Kurda screamed, making one last grab for me. But he was too late - his fingers clutched at thin air.</p><p>I drifted out into the middle of the stream, beyond the reach of Kurda and his vampaneze allies. There was a moment of strange peace, during which I bobbed up and down in the center of the stream. Locking gazes with Kurda as I hung there, I smiled thinly and pressed the middle fingers of my right hand to my forehead and eyelids, making the death's touch sign. \"Even in death, may I be triumphant!\" I howled, adding a quick silent prayer that my curse would ring true, and that my sacrifice would encourage the gods of the vampires to extract a terrible revenge on this traitor and his allies.</p><p>Then, before Kurda could respond, the current took hold and swept me away in a brutal instant, out of his sight, into darkness, churning madness, and the hungry belly of the mountain.</p>"]},{"title":"The Vampire Prince","pages":["<p>PROLOGUE</p><p>Be careful who you trust.Even a supposedly close friend might be capable of betraying you. I found that out the hard way.</p><p>My name's Darren Shan. I'm a half-vampire. I was blooded when I was very young, and for eight years I toured the world with the Cirque Du Freak - a traveling circus of magically gifted performers. Then my mentor - Larten Crepsley - said I had to be presented to the Vampire Princes.</p><p>Most of the Princes and Vampire Generals gather in the remote Vampire Mountain once every twelve years, for the Council of Vampires. After a long, tiring trek to the mountain with Mr. Crepsley, Harkat Mulds (a Little Person who'd been brought back from the dead by a powerful man called Mr. Tiny), Gavner Purl (a General), and four wolves (including a male I called Streak and a cub I nicknamed Rudi), I faced the Princes, who said I had to prove myself worthy of joining the ranks of the undead. They gave me a series of harsh tests known as the Trials of Initiation. If I passed all five tests, I'd be accepted as one of them. If I failed, I'd be killed.</p><p>I passed the first three Trials, but the fourth ended disastrously - I would have been gouged to death by a wild boar if not for Harkat, who leapt into the pit and killed the boar. The problem was, his intervention broke all the rules. While the vampires debated my fate, one sneaked into my cell and led me away to safety. He was a blond, slender, peaceful, highly intelligent vampire called Kurda Smahlt, and he was shortly due to become a Prince. I believed he was my friend.</p><p>While we were escaping, Gavner caught up with us and tried talking me into going back to face the verdict of the Princes. Kurda persuaded him to let me go. But as we were closing in on freedom, we ran into a bunch of vampaneze - purple-skinned enemies of the vampires, who kill humans when they drink from them - hiding in a cave.</p><p>That's when Kurda showed his true colors. He stabbed and killed Gavner, and I realized he was in league with the vampaneze. He tried taking me alive, but I ran and fell into a mountain stream. Kurda would have saved me, but I ignored his helping hand and surrendered myself to the vicious flow of the stream, which swiftly swept me away underground, into the belly of the mountain and certain death...</p><p>Chapter ONE</p><p>Darkness-cold - churning water - roaring, like a thousand lions - spinning around and around - bashing into rocks - arms wrapped around my face to protect it - tucking up my legs to make myself smaller, less of a target.</p><p>Wash up against a clump of roots - grab hold - slippery - the wet roots feel like dead fingers clutching at me - a space between the water and the roof of the tunnel - I draw quick gasps of breath - current takes hold again - try fighting it - roots break off in my hands - swept away.</p><p>Tumbling over and over - hit my head hard on a rock - see stars - almost black out - struggle to keep head up - spit water out of my mouth, but more gushes in - feels like I'm swallowing half the stream.</p><p>The current drags me against a wall - sharp rocks cut deeply into my thighs and h*ps - freezing-cold water numbs the pain - stops the flow of blood - a sudden drop - plummet into a deep pool - down, down, down - held under by force of the falling water - panicking - can't find my way up - drowning - if I don't break free soon, I'll...</p><p>My feet strike a wall and propel me forward - drift slowly up and away from the pool - flow is gentle here - lots of space between water and the top of the tunnel - able to bob along and breathe - air's cold, and it stings my lungs, but I gulp it down thankfully.</p><p>The stream opens out into what sounds like a large cave. Roars from the opposite end: the water must drop sharply again there. I let myself drift to one side before facing the drop. I need to rest and fill my lungs with air. As I tread water near the wall in the dark, something clutches at my bald head. It feels like twigs. I grab at them to steady myself, then realize they're not twigs - they're bones!</p><p>Too exhausted to be scared, I grasp the bones as though they were part of a life buoy. Taking long, deep breaths, I explore the bones with my fingers. They connect to a wrist, an arm, a body, and a head: a full skeleton. This stream was used to dispose of dead vampires in the past. This one must have washed up here and rotted away over the decades. I search blindly for other skeletons but find none. I wonder who the vampire was, when he lived, how long he's been here. It must be horrible, trapped in a cave like this, no proper burial, no final resting place.</p><p>I shake the skeleton, hoping to free it. The cave erupts with high-pitched screeches and flapping sounds. Wings! Dozens or hundreds of pairs of wings! Something crashes into my face and catches on my left ear. It scratches and bites. I yelp, tear it loose, and slap it away.</p><p>I can't see anything, but I sense a flurry of objects flying over and around me. Another collides with me. This time I hold on and feel around it - a bat! The cave's full of bats. They must nest here, in the roof. The sound of me shaking the skeleton disturbed them, and they've taken flight.</p><p>I don't panic. They won't attack me. They're just frightened and will settle down soon. I release the one I've caught and let it join the rush above me. The noise dies down after a few minutes, and the bats return to their perches. Silence.</p><p>I wonder how they get in and out of the cave. There must be a crack in the roof. For a few seconds I dream about finding it and climbing to safety, but my numb fingers and toes quickly put an end to thoughts like that. I couldn't climb, even if I could find the crack and it was big enough for me to fit through.</p><p>I start thinking about the skeleton again. I don't want to leave it here. I tug at it, careful this time not to make too much noise. It doesn't budge at first - it's wedged firmly. I get a stronger grip and pull again. It comes loose, all at once, and falls on top of me, driving me under. Water gushes down my throat. Now I panic! The skeleton is heavy on top of me, weighing me down. I'm going to drown! I'm going to drown! I'm going to -</p><p>No! Stop panicking. Use my brain. I wrap my arms around the skeleton and slowly roll over. It works! Now the skeleton's underneath and I'm on top. The air tastes good. My heart stops pounding. A few of the bats are circling again, but most are still.</p><p>Releasing the skeleton, I guide it out toward the middle of the cave, using my feet. I feel the current take it, then it's gone. I hang on to the wall, treading water, giving the skeleton time to wash ahead of me. I begin thinking while I wait: was it a good idea to free the skeleton? A nice gesture, but if the bones catch on a rock further along and block my way...</p><p>Too late to worry now. Should have thought of that before.</p><p>My situation's as desperate as ever. Crazy to think I might get out of this alive. But I force myself to think positively: I've made it this far, and the stream must open up sooner or later. Who's to say I can't make it to the end? Believe, Darren, believe.</p><p>I'd like to hang here forever - easier to cling on and die of the cold - but I have to try for freedom. In the end, I force my fingers to unclench and let go of the bank. I drift out into the middle of the stream. The current bites at me and takes hold. Speeding up - the exit - roaring grows furiously - flowing fast - angling sharply downward - gone.</p><p>Chapter TWO</p><p>Even worse beyond the cave- makes the first half of the ride seem like a dip in a swimming pool - sickening drops and turns - walls studded with jagged stones - water gushes wildly, madly - tossed about as though made of putty - impossible to exert control - no time to pause for breath - lungs bursting - hold my arms tight over my head - tuck my legs up as far as they'll go - conserve oxygen - bash my head on rocks - my back - legs - belly - back - head - shoulders - head...</p><p>Lose count of the crashes - can't feel pain any longer - eyes playing tricks on me - looking up, it's as if the rocks are invisible - I believe I can see the sky, the stars, the moon - this is the beginning of the end - senses confused, brain shuts down - out of luck - out of hope - out of life.</p><p>I open my mouth to take one long, last drink of water - slam into a wall - air explodes out of me - force of crash pushes me upward - I break through to a small pocket of air between water and roof - lungs draw it in greedily, automatically.</p><p>I float here a few seconds, pressed against the wall, gasping in air - current takes me again and drags me under - through a narrow tunnel - incredible speed - like a bullet - tunnel getting narrower - speed increases - my back scrapes along the wall - the rock's smooth, otherwise I'd be cut to shreds - feels like a water slide - almost enjoying this part of the nightmarish ride.</p><p>Tunnel evens out - running low on oxygen again - try forcing head up to search for air - can't - don't have the energy to fight.</p><p>Water creeps up my nose - I cough - water pours down my throat - I'm losing the battle - roll over, facedown - this is the end - lungs are filling with water - I can't close my mouth - waiting for death - all of a sudden: no water - flying - (flying?) - whistling air surrounds me - looking down at land - stream cutting through it - floating, as though I'm a bird or a bat - closer to stream - closer - are my eyes playing tricks again?</p><p>Turn over in middle of flight - look up - sky, real sky, open and bright with stars - beautiful-</p><p>I'm out! - I'm really out - I made it! - I can breathe. I'm alive! I'm...</p><p>Flight ends - hit water hard - impact shakes my guts to pieces and knocks my brain out of order - blackness again, only this time inside my head.</p><p>Chapter THREE</p><p>Consciousness returns gradually.Sounds strike me first: the roar of the water, much softer than in the mountain, almost lyrical. Slowly, my eyes flutter open. I'm staring up at stars, drifting along on my back. Luck or my body's natural defenses? I don't know. I don't care. I'm alive!</p><p>The current isn't strong here. I could easily swim to the bank, pull myself to safety, and begin the trip back to Vampire Mountain, which I see in the distance. Except I don't have the strength. I try rolling over to swim - can't. My legs and arms are like dead blocks of wood. I've survived the ride through the mountain, but the cost has been high. I'm completely limp and helpless.</p><p>I study the landscape while the stream sweeps me further away from Vampire Mountain. It's rugged and unspectacular, but beautiful after the darkness. Anything would seem beautiful after the darkness. I'll never take the countryside for granted again.</p><p>Am I dying? I could be - no feeling, no control, at the mercy of the stream. Maybe I'm dead already and just haven't realized it. No! Not dead. Water splashes up my nose and I splutter: proof I'm still alive. I won't give up, not after all I've been through. I have to find strength to make it to the bank. I can't drift along like this forever: the longer it drags on, the harder it will be.</p><p>I try willing energy into my exhausted limbs. I think about dying young and what a waste it would be, but that doesn't give me strength. I think about the vampires and the threat they face from Kurda and the vampaneze, but that doesn't work either. Finally, an old vampire myth succeeds in spreading a burst of fire through my icy bones: I recall the myth that a vampire who dies in running water is doomed to stick around as a ghost - no journey to Paradise for those who die in rivers or streams.</p><p>Strangely (as I never believed the myth), the thought spurs me into action. I raise a weak arm and flap feebly for the bank. The action doesn't do much, apart from spin me around a little, but the fact that I'm able to move at all fills me with hope.</p><p>Gritting my teeth, I face the bank and force my legs up behind me. They respond sluggishly, but they do respond. I try to swim freestyle - can't. I roll over onto my back, kick weakly with my feet, and guide myself with gentle hand motions. I slowly pull toward the bank. It takes a long time, and I'm swept much further away from Vampire Mountain, but finally I'm in shallow water, out of the current.</p><p>I half rise to my knees, then collapse. Lying facedown, I turn my head sideways, splutter, then get back on my knees. I crawl out of the water onto the snowy bank, where I collapse again. My eyes close. I weep silently into the snow.</p><p>I want to lie here and freeze: simpler than moving. But my feet are still in the water and I don't like the feel of them drifting behind me, so I pull them out. The effort goads me into further action. Groaning, I brace myself, then rise slowly and painfully to my feet.</p><p>Standing, I stare around as if I'm on an alien planet. Everything looks different. Day is breaking, but stars and the moon still shine lightly in the sky. After so long inside the mountain, I'd forgotten what daylight looks like. It's wonderful. I could stand here all day and just stare, except that wouldn't get me anywhere, and soon I'd fall, into the stream or the snow, and freeze.</p><p>Sighing, obeying some insistent inner instinct, I drag my feet forward a few steps, pause, shake my head, straighten up, and lurch away from the stream, which froths and hisses angrily behind me - cheated of its victim.</p><p>Chapter FOUR</p><p>It didn't take me longto realize I couldn't make it very far if I continued in this state. I was soaked to the bone. My clothes were heavy with water, and the air around me was bitterly cold. Mr. Crepsley had told me what to do if this ever happened: get rid of the wet clothes quickly, or I'd freeze to death inside them.</p><p>It took a lot of effort to get out of my clothes. My fingers were numb, and I ended up having to use my teeth to tear my way out. But I felt better after I'd undressed. A great weight had been lifted from my body, and although the full force of the cold hit me immediately, I started at a brisker pace.</p><p>It didn't bother me that I was wandering around as na**d as the animals of the wild. There was nobody to see. Even if there had been, I wouldn't have cared - being so close to death, modesty was the last thing on my mind.</p><p>My brisk pace didn't last long. After a while, I began to understand just how serious a mess I was in. I was stranded in the middle of nowhere, no clothes to protect me from the cold, beaten to a pulp, physically and mentally drained, with nothing to eat. It was a struggle just to keep moving. In a matter of minutes, I would run out of energy and collapse. The cold would set in. Frostbite and hypothermia would finish me off.</p>","<p>I tried jogging, to warm myself up, but couldn't. My legs simply wouldn't work. It was a miracle they were able to support me at all. Anything faster than a slow crawl was beyond them.</p><p>I stopped and turned in a full circle, hoping to see something familiar. If I was close to one of the resting places known as way stations, used by vampires in their travels to and from Council, there might be hope. I could hole up, catch a day or two of sleep, and recover my strength. A good plan, with just one major flaw - I had no clue where I was or if there were any way stations nearby.</p><p>I weighed my options. Standing still would get me nowhere. And scouting for a way station was out of the question - I didn't have the strength or time. The first order of the day was to find somewhere sheltered to rest. Food, warmth, and working my way back to Vampire Mountain could come later - if I survived.</p><p>There was a forest about half a mile to my left.</p><p>That was the best place to head. I could curl up at the base of a tree and cover myself with leaves. Maybe find some insects or small animals to eat. It wasn't ideal, but it made more sense than standing here in the open, or climbing slippery rocks in search of caves.</p><p>I fell many times on my way to the forest. That wasn't surprising - I was amazed I'd made it this far. Each time I lay in the snow a few minutes, gathering my strength, then hauled myself to my feet and staggered on again.</p><p>The forest had become a magical beacon. I was convinced that if I could make it to the trees, everything would be fine. Deep inside, I knew that was nonsense, but the belief kept me going. Without it, I'd have been unable to continue.</p><p>I finally ran out of steam a hundred yards or less from the first trees of the forest. I knew in my heart, as I lay panting in the snow, that I'd reached the end of my strength. All the same, I rested a few minutes, as I had before, then tried to rise - no good. I made it as far as my knees, then dropped. Another long rest. Again I tried to rise. Again I fell, this time face first into the snow, where I lay, shivering, unable to roll over.</p><p>The cold was unbearable. A human would have died from it long ago. Only the vampire blood in my veins had kept me going. But even the powerful blood of the vampires had its limits. I'd pushed to the very end of mine. I had no strength left, not even the tiniest morsel.</p><p>I was finished.</p><p>I wept pitifully as I lay there, tears turning to ice on my cheeks. Snowflakes drifted onto my eyelashes. I tried lifting a hand to brush them away, but couldn't. Even that small gesture was beyond me. \"What an awful way to die,\" I moaned. Another hundred yards and I would have been safe. To collapse and die this close to the end was a shame. Maybe if I'd rested more in the cave in the mountain, I'd have had the energy to continue. Or if I'd-</p><p>A sharp, yapping sound jolted me out of my reverie. I'd closed my eyes and been drifting off to sleep/death. At the sound, I cracked them open. I couldn't move my head, and the flakes of snow clouded my vision, but I was staring in the general direction of the forest and could see a vague shape making its way toward me, tumbling through the snow. Oh, great, I thought. As if things weren't bad enough - now something's going to come along and eat me before I'm dead! Could things get any worse? Judging by what had happened to me recently - yes!</p><p>I shut my eyes as the creature came nearer and hoped I'd be too numb to feel its teeth and claws as it devoured me. Fighting back was out of the question - a squirrel could have knocked me out, in my condition.</p><p>Hot breath clouded my face. A long tongue licked around my nose. I shivered. It licked again, this time my cheeks and ears. Then it licked the snowflakes from my eyelashes.</p><p>I opened my eyes and blinked. What was going on? Was it cleaning me up before it killed me? That seemed unlikely. Yet what other explanation could there be? As I adjusted my vision, the animal nudged back a bit and came into focus. My jaw dropped. My lips quivered. And in a pained, shaky voice, I mumbled incredulously, \"Rudi?\"</p><p>Chapter FIVE</p><p>Rudi was the wolf cubwho'd accompanied Mr. Crepsley, Harkat, Gavner, and me on part of the journey to Vampire Mountain. He'd been in a small pack that included two she-wolves and a large male whom I'd christened Streak. They'd left us to unite with other wolf packs close to Vampire Mountain.</p><p>Rudi leapt around me, barking with excitement. He'd grown since I'd last seen him: his fangs were longer and his fur was even thicker. I managed to lift my head and smile weakly. \"I'm in big trouble, Rudi,\" I muttered as the cub licked my fingers. He cocked his ears and gazed at me seriously, as though he understood. \"Big trouble,\" I repeated softly, then collapsed again.</p><p>Rudi rubbed his nose against my right cheek. It was wet and warm. He licked around my eyes and ears, then pressed his body against mine, trying to warm me up. When he saw how helpless I was, he took a few paces back and howled. Moments later, a second wolf emerged from the forest, larger, sleeker, and every bit as familiar as Rudi.</p><p>\"Streak,\" I whispered as the wolf advanced cautiously. His ears perked up when he heard my voice, then he bounded forward. Rudi kept yapping until Streak snapped at him. The adult wolf sniffed me from head to toe, then barked at Rudi. They lay out flat beside me, Streak behind, Rudi in front, covering most of my body with theirs, transmitting their heat.</p><p>After a few minutes, warmth seeped through me. I flexed and unflexed my fingers and toes, working the worst of the chill out of them. I curled up into a ball, so the wolves could cover more of me, and buried my face between Rudi's hairy shoulders. We lay like that for hours, the wolves shifting position every so often to keep warm. Finally, Streak got to his feet and barked.</p><p>I tried getting up. Failed. Shook my head and groaned. \"It's no use. I can't go on.\" The wolf studied me silently, then bent and bit my butt! I yelped and rolled away instinctively. Streak followed, and I leapt to my feet. \"Stay back, you no-good -,\" I shouted, then stopped when I saw the look on his face.</p><p>I stared down at my body, then at Streak, and grinned sheepishly. \"I'm standing,\" I whispered redundantly. Streak howled softly, then nipped my right leg lightly and faced the trees. Nodding wearily, I set off for the forest, and the wolves padded along beside me.</p><p>The going wasn't easy. I was cold and exhausted, and stumbled more times than I could keep track of. Streak and Rudi kept me going. Whenever I stalled, they pressed against me, or breathed warmly over me, or snapped to make me get up. At one stage, Streak let me grab the thick, long hair around his neck, and half-dragged me through the snow.</p><p>I'm not sure why they bothered with me - usually wild animals leave wounded companions behind if they can't keep up. Maybe they wanted to stay on the good side of the vampires, who gave them lots of scraps during Council. Or perhaps they sensed hidden resources within me and knew my cause wasn't hopeless.</p><p>After a long, hard walk, we entered a glade, where a large pack of wolves had gathered. There must have been twenty or thirty of them, lying about, eating, playing, and grooming themselves, all different colors, builds, and breeds. The wolves regarded me with suspicion. One, a dark, bulky male, padded over and sniffed me, then growled threateningly, raising its hackles. Streak met its challenge and growled back.</p><p>The two stood snarling at each other for a few seconds before the unwelcoming wolf turned its back on us and loped away.</p><p>Rudi ran after the dark wolf, yapping, but Streak barked angrily at the cub, and he returned, tail between his legs. As I blinked owlishly at the wolves, Streak nudged me forward to where a she-wolf was suckling three cubs. She laid a protective paw over her cubs and growled at us as we approached, but Streak whined and dropped to his belly to show he meant no harm.</p><p>When the she-wolf had relaxed, Streak stood and locked gazes with the female. The she-wolf snarled. Streak bared his fangs and snarled back, pawed at the snow in front of her, then locked gazes again. This time, she lowered her head and didn't respond. Streak struck the backs of my legs with his snout, and I dropped to the ground. As he nudged me on, I understood what he wanted me to do. \"No!\" I resisted, insides churning. \"I can't!\"</p><p>Streak growled and pushed me forward. I was too weak to argue. Besides, it made sense - I was cold and hungry, but too weak to eat. I needed to get something warm and nourishing into me, something that didn't need to be chewed.</p><p>I lay down and wriggled forward, gently shoving the three cubs to one side, making space. The cubs yapped suspiciously at me, then crowded around, sniffed me all over, and accepted me as one of their own. When my face was up close to the suckling she-wolf's belly, I took a deep breath, paused, then found a teat, closed my lips around it, and drank.</p><p>Chapter SIX</p><p>The she-wolf treated methe same as the three cubs, making sure I got enough milk, covering me with her paws to keep me warm, licking behind my ears and around my face to clean me (I crept away when I had to go to the bathroom!). I remained with her for a couple of days, slowly regaining my strength, cuddling up to her and the cubs for warmth, surviving on her warm milk. It didn't taste good, but I was in no position to complain.</p><p>Pain racked my body as I recovered. Bruises covered me like purple leeches. My cuts weren't too serious - the cold restricted the flow of blood - but they stung like crazy. I wished I had some of Seba's healing spider webs to apply to them.</p><p>The more I thought about my slide down the mountain stream, the more incredible it seemed. Had I really done it, or was this some crazy dream? If not for the pain, I might have believed it was the latter, but dreams are painless, so it had to be real.</p><p>More incredible still was that I hadn't broken any major bones. Three fingers on my left hand were broken, my right thumb was sticking out at an alarming angle, and my left ankle had swollen up like a balloon, but otherwise I seemed to be OK. I could move my arms and legs, my skull hadn't been cracked open, my spine hadn't snapped in two. All things considered, I was in astonishingly good shape.</p><p>As the days passed, I stretched and tested myself. I still slept beside the she-wolf and drank from her, but I started getting up to take short walks, hobbling around the glade, exercising lightly. My left ankle hurt terribly, but the swelling went down, and it eventually returned to normal.</p><p>As my strength returned, Streak brought me meat and berries. I couldn't eat a lot in the beginning, but I sucked plenty of blood from the small animals he brought, and my appetite increased quickly.</p><p>Rudi spent a lot of time with me. He was fascinated by my bald head - I'd had to shave my hair off after it caught fire during one of my Trials of Initiation - and never tired of licking it and rubbing his chin and nose over it.</p><p>After four days (possibly five or six - I hadn't kept close track of time) the wolves moved on to a new patch. It was a long march - seven or eight miles - and I lagged behind most of the way, helped along by Streak, Rudi, and the she-wolf who'd been suckling me (she now regarded me as one of her cubs and mothered me the same as the others).</p><p>As hard as the trek was, it was beneficial, and when I awoke that night after a long, dreamless sleep, I felt almost as good as I had before my descent down the stream. The worst of the bruising had subsided, the cuts had healed, my ankle hardly bothered me, and I was able to eat normally.</p><p>That night, I went hunting with the pack. I couldn't move fast, but I kept up and helped bring down an old reindeer that several of the wolves were tracking. It felt good to be contributing to the pack after they'd done so much for me, and I gave most of my share of the meat to the she-wolf and cubs.</p><p>There was a nasty scene the next day. The dark wolf who'd objected to my presence when Streak brought me into the pack had never accepted me. He growled and barked whenever I came close and often snatched food from my hands while I was feeding. I avoided him as much as I could, but that day, when he saw me playing with the cubs and handing meat out to them, he snapped.</p><p>He charged at me, barking wildly, trying to drive me off. I backed away from him slowly, not showing any fear, but I didn't leave the pack - if I let him chase me out once, he'd never stop hounding me. I circled around the wolves, hoping he'd lose interest in me, but he followed, determined, snarling menacingly.</p><p>As I prepared to fight, Streak darted between us and faced the darker wolf. He bristled to make himself look big and growled deeply. It looked as though the dark wolf would back off, but then he lowered his head, bared his fangs, and lunged at Streak, claws extended.</p><p>Streak met the challenge, and the pair rolled away, biting and scratching at each other. The wolves around them hastily cleared out of their way. Some younger cubs yapped with excitement, but most of the older wolves ignored the fighting or looked on with only mild interest. They were used to fights like this.</p><p>It seemed to me as though the wolves were going to tear each other to pieces, and I ran around them, hoping to pull them apart. But as the fight progressed, I realized that, for all their barking, snapping, and clawing, they weren't doing a lot of actual damage. Streak's snout had been scratched, and the dark wolf was bleeding from a couple of bites, but they weren't out to really hurt each other. It was more like a wrestling match than anything else.</p><p>As the fight wore on, it became obvious that Streak was beating the other wolf. He wasn't as heavily built, but he was faster and sharper, and for every swipe to the head he took, he delivered two or three of his own.</p><p>All of a sudden, the dark wolf stopped, lay down, and rolled over, baring his throat and belly. Streak opened his mouth and clamped his teeth around the dark wolf's throat, then let go without breaking the skin and stood back. The dark wolf got to his feet and slunk away, tail between his legs.</p><p>I thought the wolf might have to leave the pack, but he didn't. Although he slept by himself that night, none of the wolves tried to chase him away, and he took his regular place in the hunting pack the next time they set out.</p><p>I thought about that a lot over the next day or two, comparing the way wolves handled their losers to how vampires handled theirs. In the world of vampires, defeat was a disgrace and more often than not ended with the death of the defeated. Wolves were more understanding. Honor mattered to them, but they wouldn't kill or shun a member of their pack just because it had lost face. Young wolf cubs had to endure tests of maturity, just as I'd endured the Trials of Initiation, but they weren't killed if they failed.</p>","<p>I wasn't an expert on the subject, but it seemed to me that vampires could learn a thing or two from wolves if they took the time to study their ways. It was possible to be both honorable and practical. Kurda Smahlt, for all his treacherous faults, got that much right at least.</p><p>Chapter SEVEN</p><p>Afew more days slipped by. I was so glad to be alive, I was savoring every moment of it. My body had healed almost completely, though faint bruises lingered in certain places. My strength had returned. I was full of energy, ready to go.</p><p>I barely noticed the cold. I'd grown used to the nip of the wind and the chill of the snow. The occasional strong blast set me shivering, but most of the time I felt as natural wandering about na**d as the wolves.</p><p>I'd been accepted as an equal member of the pack now that I was back on my feet, and I was constantly out hunting - since I was able to run faster than the wolves, my services were in great demand. I was gradually coming to terms with the way they thought and communicated. I couldn't read their thoughts, but most of the time I had a good idea what they were thinking - I could tell by the way they hunched their shoulders, widened or narrowed their eyes, perked or dropped their ears and tails, growled or barked or whined. On the hunt, if Streak or another wolf wanted me to go to the left or the right, he only had to look at me and twitch his head. If a she-wolf wanted me to play with her cubs, she howled in a certain soft way, and I knew she was calling me.</p><p>The wolves, for their part, seemed able to understand everything I said. I rarely spoke - there wasn't much need for words - but whenever I did, they'd c*ck their heads intently and listen, then reply with a yap or gesture.</p><p>We moved around a lot, as was the wolves' way. I kept an eye open for Vampire Mountain, but didn't see it. That puzzled me - the reason the wolves met out here in the wild was to converge on the mountain and eat the leftovers that the vampires threw to them. I decided to ask Streak about it, although I didn't think he'd be able to comprehend my question or fashion a reply. To my surprise, when I mentioned Vampire Mountain, the hairs rose on the back of his neck, and he growled.</p><p>\"You don't want to go there?\" I frowned. \"Why not?\" Streak's only reply was another growl. Thinking about it, I guessed it had to be the vampaneze. The wolves must know about the purple-skinned invaders, or else they'd simply sensed trouble and were steering clear of the mountain.</p><p>I had to do something about the vampaneze, but the thought of going back to Vampire Mountain scared me. I was afraid the vampires would kill me before I had a chance to explain about the vampaneze. Or they might think I was lying and take Kurda's word over mine. Eventually I'd have to return, but I was delaying as long as possible, pretending to myself that I was still recovering and not fit to make the trip.</p><p>My three broken fingers had healed. I'd set the bones as best I could - very painful! - and wrapped the fingers together using long reeds and leaves. The thumb on my right hand still stuck out at an angle and hurt when I moved it, but that was only a minor irritation.</p><p>When I wasn't hunting or playing with the cubs, I thought a lot about Gavner. I got a pain in my stomach whenever I recalled his death, but I couldn't stop thinking about him. The loss of a friend is a terrible, tragic thing, especially when it happens suddenly, without warning.</p><p>What really sickened me about Gavner's death was that it could have been avoided. If I hadn't run away, or if I hadn't trusted Kurda, or if I'd stayed and fought with Gavner - he'd still be alive. It wasn't fair. He didn't deserve to die. He'd been a brave, loyal, warmhearted vampire, a friend to all.</p><p>Sometimes when I thought about him, I was filled with hatred and wished I'd grabbed his knife and killed Kurda, even if it meant my own death at the hands of the vampaneze. Other times, a sweeping sadness would come over me, and I'd cover my face with my hands and cry, wondering what prompted Kurda to do such an awful thing.</p><p>The wolves were puzzled by my behavior. They didn't spend much time grieving for their dead. If they lost a partner or cub, they howled miserably for a while, then got on with their lives. They couldn't understand my mood swings.</p><p>To cheer me up, Streak took me out hunting with him late one evening. Normally, we never went hunting by ourselves, but the pack was settling in for the night, so we went without them.</p><p>It was nice to be on our own. A drawback to running with a pack is that you have to be very organized - if you make a wrong move that ruins the hunt, you're treated with disgust. Now that it was just Streak and me, we were free to lollop along as we pleased and make idle detours. It didn't matter whether we caught something or not - we were in search of sport, not prey.</p><p>We tracked a couple of young, frisky reindeer. We didn't expect to catch them, but it was fun to follow them. I think they sensed our harmless intentions because they kept turning back and running at us, then tossing their heads and fleeing. We'd been tracking them for almost fifteen minutes when the two reindeer reached the top of a small mound and paused to sniff the air. I started after them, but Streak growled and drew to a halt.</p><p>I stopped, wondering what was wrong. Streak was standing stock-still like the reindeer. Then, as the reindeer turned and bolted back toward us, he nudged my legs with his snout and took off for a clump of bushes to the side. I followed quickly, trusting his more highly developed senses. We found a thick bush that gave us a clear view of the mound and lay low behind it.</p><p>A minute passed. Two. Then a figure appeared over the mound. My eyes were as sharp as they'd ever been, and I recognized the far-off vampire immediately - Mr. Crepsley!</p><p>I started to get to my feet, overjoyed, and opened my mouth to roar a greeting. A low growl from Streak stopped me. The wolf's tail hung flat behind him, the way it did when he was anxious. I wanted to rush forward to greet my old friend, but I knew Streak wouldn't be acting this way without good reason.</p><p>Lying down flat beside the wolf, I kept my eyes on the mound, and soon the cause for his concern became obvious: behind Mr. Crepsley marched five other vampires, and in the front, carrying a sharp, polished sword, was the would-be Prince and traitor - Kurda Smahlt!</p><p>Chapter EIGHT</p><p>Ikept close to the ground as the vampires passed, hidden behind the bushes, downwind so they couldn't smell me. Once they were out of immediate range, I turned to Streak. \"We have to follow them,\" I whispered. Streak studied me in silence with his large yellow eyes, then got to his feet. He slipped farther back through the bushes. I trailed after him, trusting him not to lead me astray. A few minutes later, we circled around and caught sight of the vampires. We fell in behind them and matched their pace, careful not to get too close.</p><p>I examined the four vampires with Mr. Crepsley and Kurda. Three were unfamiliar, but the fourth was Arra Sails. Her right arm had been in a sling the last time I saw her, but it was now hanging freely by her side. After a while, I noticed that two of the unfamiliar vampires were carrying swords like Kurda's and were lagging a bit behind Arra and the other unarmed vampire.</p><p>It became clear what was happening. Mr. Crepsley had decided to come looking for me. Arra and the other vampire had agreed to accompany him. Kurda, worried that I might have somehow survived, must have offered to assist and brought the armed vampires with him. If they discovered me alive, the swords would flash, and that would be the end of me, Mr. Crepsley, Arra, and the other vampire. Kurda was making sure word of his betrayal never made it back to the Generals and Princes.</p><p>I wasn't surprised by Kurda's devious plotting, but I was upset by the realization that he wasn't the only traitor. The two vampires with swords must have known the truth about him and the vampaneze, otherwise he wouldn't have been able to rely on them. I suspected the Guardians of the Blood (weird humans who live inside Vampire Mountain and donate their blood in exchange for the internal organs of dead vampires) of being part of the conspiracy, but I'd thought Kurda was the only vampire traitor - it looked like I was wrong.</p><p>If Mr. Crepsley and Arra hadn't been concentrating so hard on the search, they'd have realized something was amiss - the sword-bearing vampires were edgy, all nervous glances and itchy fingers. I'd love to have jumped out and shocked Kurda - he was the edgiest of all - but common sense prevailed. If I was spotted alive, he and his men would kill me and the three true vampires. As long as they believed I was dead, they wouldn't do anything to give themselves away.</p><p>I spent a long time studying the faces of Kurda's companions, committing them to memory. I wondered how many more were in on the plot to destroy the clan. Not many, I bet. The vampires with him were very young. Kurda most likely recruited them himself and talked them into his way of thinking before they learned the ways of the vampires. More experienced vampires, who valued honor and loyalty, would never dream of being in cahoots with a traitor.</p><p>After a while, the group came to a halt in a small clearing, where they sat and rested, except Mr. Crepsley, who spent the period anxiously pacing. I tapped Streak's shoulder, then pointed toward the clearing - I wanted to get closer. The wolf hesitated, sniffed the air, then led the way forward. We carefully crawled to within seven or eight yards of the clearing, where we stopped, hidden by a dead tree trunk. With my developed sense of hearing, I could eavesdrop perfectly from there.</p><p>Nothing was said for several minutes. The vampires were blowing into their cupped hands and tugging their jackets closer to themselves, shivering from the cold. I smiled as I thought how uncomfortable they'd feel if they were in my compromising position.</p><p>After a while, Kurda got up and walked over to Mr. Crepsley. \"Think we'll find him?\" the traitor asked, feigning concern.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley sighed. \"Probably not. But I would like to keep searching. I wish to locate his body and cremate him fittingly.\"</p><p>\"He might still be alive,\" Kurda said.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley laughed bleakly. \"We traced his path through the tunnels. We know he fell into the stream and did not emerge. You truly think he may have survived?\"</p><p>Kurda shook his head, as though deeply depressed. The dirty swine! He might not think I was alive, but he wasn't taking any chances either. If not for that sword of his, I'd have-</p><p>I calmed down and tuned back in to the conversation. Arra had joined the pair and was saying, \"... saw wolf tracks farther back. They might have discovered his body and devoured him. We should check.\"</p><p>\"I doubt if they would have eaten him,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Wolves respect vampires, as we respect them. Besides, his blood would have poisoned them, and we would have heard their mad howling.\"</p><p>There was a brief moment of silence, then Arra muttered, \"I'd love to know what happened in those tunnels. If Darren had been by himself and fallen in, I could understand it, but Gavner has disappeared too.\"</p><p>My insides froze at the mention of Gavner.</p><p>\"Either he fell into the stream trying to save Darren,\" Kurda said lightly, \"or Darren fell in trying to save him. That's the only answer I can think of.\"</p><p>\"But how did they fall in?\" Arra asked. \"The stream wasn't wide where they fell. They should have been able to clear it. Even if it was too wide for them, why didn't they just jump where it was narrower? It makes no sense.\"</p><p>Kurda shrugged and pretended to be as baffled as the others.</p><p>\"At least we know that Gavner is dead,\" Mr. Crepsley remarked. \"Although we have not found his body, the absence of his mental signal means he breathes no longer. His death distresses me, but the uncertainty regarding Darren unsettles me more. The odds are stacked against his being alive, but until we have proof that he is dead, I shall not be able to accept it.\"</p><p>It was oddly comforting to know that even in the midst of worry, Mr. Crepsley had lost none of his elaborate ways of talking.</p><p>\"We'll go on searching,\" Kurda said. \"If he can be found, we'll find him.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley shook his head and sighed again.</p><p>\"No,\" he said. \"If we do not locate his body tonight, we must abandon the search. There is your investiture to prepare for.\"</p><p>\"Forget the investiture,\" Kurda snorted.</p><p>\"No,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"The night after next, you become a Prince. That takes precedence above all else.\"</p><p>\"But-,\" Kurda began.</p><p>\"No,\" Mr. Crepsley growled. \"Your investiture as a Prince is more important than the loss of Gavner and Darren. You have bucked tradition already by leaving the confines of the mountain so close to the ceremony. You must stop thinking about Darren. As a Prince, it is your duty to put the will and wishes of others before your own. Your people expect you to spend tomorrow fasting and preparing for the investiture. You must not disappoint them.\"</p><p>\"Very well,\" Kurda groaned. \"But this isn't the end of it. I'm as upset by what's happened as you are. I won't rest until we know for sure if Darren is alive or dead.\"</p><p>The hypocrite! Standing there, acting innocent, pretending to be upset. If only I'd had a gun or a crossbow, I'd have shot him dead where he stood, the laws of the vampires - which forbid the use of weapons such as guns and bows - be damned!</p><p>When the vampires moved on, I stayed where I was, thinking hard. Talk of Kurda's investiture had disturbed me. It had slipped my mind that he was due to be made a Vampire Prince. But now that I thought about it, things took ominous shape. I'd thought the vampaneze just meant to kill as many vampires as they could and take over the mountain, but the more I considered it, the less sense that made. Why go to all that risk just to take over a bunch of caves they couldn't have cared less about? And even if they killed every vampire present, there were plenty more who could hurry to the mountain and fight to reclaim it.</p><p>There must be a logical reason for them being here, and I thought I knew what it was - the Stone of Blood. The Stone of Blood was a magical stone with which a vampire or vampaneze could locate almost every vampire on the face of the planet. With the Stone, the vampaneze could track down and destroy vampires at will.</p>","<p>The Stone was also rumored to be the only object that could save the vampires from being wiped out by the legendary Lord of the Vampaneze, who was supposed to arise one night and lead the vampaneze into a victorious fight with the vampires. If the dreaded Lord was coming - as Mr. Tiny said - the vampaneze would naturally be eager to get their hands on the one thing that stood between them and total victory.</p><p>But the Stone of Blood was magically protected in the Hall of Princes. No matter how many vampires the vampaneze killed, or how much of the mountain they claimed, they'd never be able to enter the Hall of Princes and get at the Stone of Blood, because only a Vampire Prince was capable of opening the doors to the Hall.</p><p>Only. A. Vampire. Prince.</p><p>Like Paris Skyle, Mika Ver Leth, Arrow, or Vancha March. Or - the night after next - Kurda Smahlt.</p><p>That was the plan! Once Kurda was invested, he'd be able to open the doors to the Hall of Princes whenever he wanted. When he was ready, he'd sneak the vampaneze up from the caves and tunnels - he knew ways into the Halls that no one else knew - lead them to the Hall of Princes, kill everyone there, and take control of the Stone of Blood. Once that was in his hands, vampires everywhere would have to do what he said - or perish disobeying him.</p><p>In less than forty-eight hours Kurda would be invested and the Hall would be his for the taking. Nobody knew of his treachery, so nobody could stop him - except me. Reluctant as I was to face the vampires who'd condemned me to death, it was time to return to Vampire Mountain. I had to warn the Generals and Princes before Kurda could betray them. Even if they killed me for it.</p><p>Chapter NINE</p><p>Once we were back with the pack, I told Streak I had to leave for Vampire Mountain. The wolf growled and loosely grabbed my right ankle with his fangs, trying to keep me with him. \"I have to go!\" I snapped. \"I must stop the vampaneze!\"</p><p>Streak released me when I mentioned the vampaneze, snarling softly. \"They plan to attack the vampires,\" I said quietly. \"They'll kill them all unless I stop them.\"</p><p>Streak stared at me, panting heavily, then pawed the snow, sniffed the marks he'd made, and yelped. It was obvious he was trying to communicate something important to me, but I couldn't interpret his actions. \"I don't understand,\" I said.</p><p>Streak growled, again ran his nose over the tracks he'd made, then turned and padded away. I followed. He led me to a shabby she-wolf resting slightly away from the pack. I'd noticed her before but hadn't paid much attention to her - she was old, not far from death's door, and didn't have much to do with the pack, surviving off scraps they left behind.</p><p>The she-wolf regarded us suspiciously as we approached. Struggling to her feet, she backed away cautiously, but Streak dropped to his belly and rolled over to show he meant no harm. I did the same, and the she-wolf relaxed. When Streak sat up, he pressed close to the she-wolf, whose eyes weren't strong, and stared at her long and hard, growling softly, meaningfully. He made marks in the snow, similar to the ones he'd made for me, then barked at the old she-wolf. She peered at the marks, then up at me, and whined. Streak barked again, to which she replied with a louder, sharper whine.</p><p>As I studied the wolves, wondering what was going on, it suddenly struck me that Streak was asking the old she-wolf - I decided on an impulse to call her Magda (my grandmother's name) - to lead me to Vampire Mountain. But all the wolves knew where the mountain was. Why was Streak asking this ancient, pitiful she-wolf to lead me? It made no sense. Unless... My eyes widened. Unless Magda knew a way not just to the mountain, but up it!</p><p>\"You know how to get inside!\" I gasped, crouching forward with excitement. Magda stared at me blankly, but I knew in my gut I was right. I could find my way up the mountain by myself, using common, marked passages, except it would be very difficult to avoid detection that way. But if Magda knew of older, less-used passages, I might be able to sneak in!</p><p>I turned to Streak imploringly. \"Can she take me there? Willshe?\"</p><p>Streak ignored me and butted Magda softly with his head, scratching at the marks he'd made in the snow. The she-wolf whined one last time, then lowered her head obediently. I wasn't happy that Streak had bullied her into obeying him, but my need to get safely to the Princes at the top of Vampire Mountain was more important - if a bit of bullying was required to help me sneak past the vampaneze, so be it.</p><p>\"How far up the mountain can she take me?\" I asked. \"To the top, the Hall of Princes?\" But this was too much for the wolves to comprehend - I'd just have to let her lead me as far as she could, and make my own way from there.</p><p>\"Can we go now?\" I asked, eager to start - I wasn't sure how long the trek would take, and time was precious.</p><p>Magda struggled to her feet, ready to follow me, but Streak snarled at me, then jerked his head at Magda and led her through the pack to feast on fresh meat - he wanted to feed her before we set off, which was a wise move, given the sorry state she was in.</p><p>While Magda fed, I hopped nervously from foot to foot, thinking about the journey ahead and wondering if we'd make it in time, if Magda really knew the way into and up the mountain, and even if I made it to the top, past the vampaneze, how exactly I could contact the Princes, before some overanxious guard or coconspirator of Kurda's saw me and hacked me down.</p><p>When Magda had eaten her fill, we set off. Streak accompanied us, along with two other young male wolves - they seemed to be tagging along for the adventure! Rudi followed us out of camp, yapping with excitement, until Streak nipped him sharply and sent him scampering away. I'd miss the young cub, but there was no place for him where we were headed, so I bade him a silent farewell and left him behind, along with the rest of the pack.</p><p>The trek was good at first. Wolves can't run very fast but are strong, able to maintain a steady pace for hours. We surged through the forest, across snow and rocks, making great time.</p><p>Then Magda tired. The she-wolf wasn't used to matching the pace of young, tireless males. The wolves would have run on ahead, leaving her to catch up later, but I didn't like the idea of abandoning her. When they saw me slow down to jog beside her, they circled back to join us.</p><p>We rested for a few minutes every hour or so. As day dawned, I began to recognize my surroundings. By my reckoning, allowing for our pace and pauses, we would reach the tunnels a couple of hours before sunset.</p><p>It actually took a little longer than I thought. When the ground rose, Magda's pace slowed even more. We still made the tunnels an hour before the sun went down, but I was filled with pessimism - Magda was in very poor shape. If the route to the tunnels had left her panting for breath and shaking with exhaustion, how would she cope with a long, hard climb up the mountain?</p><p>I said to Magda that she could stay here and leave me to make my own way, but she growled stubbornly. I got the sense that she would continue - not for my sake, but her own. Old wolves were seldom given the opportunity to shine. Magda was relishing her role and would rather die than quit. As a half-vampire, I understood that, so even though I wasn't pleased about letting the she-wolf exhaust herself, I decided not to stop her.</p><p>We spent the night waiting in the tunnel near the base of the mountain. The young wolves were restless and eager to proceed, but I knew that night was when the vampires and vampaneze would be most active, so I held my position, and the wolves had no choice but to stay with me. Finally, as the sun rose on the land outside, I stood and nodded, and we climbed.</p><p>The tunnels Magda led us through were mostly narrow and unused. Many were natural tunnels, unlike the mainly vampire-carved tunnels that link the Halls. A lot of crawling and slinking along on our bellies was required. It was uncomfortable (and painful in places for someone without any clothes!) but I didn't mind - since no vampires or vampaneze used these tunnels, nobody could catch me!</p><p>We stopped for regular rests. The climb was having a dreadful effect on Magda - she looked ready to topple over and die - but she wasn't the only one who found the going tough. All of us were sweating and panting, groaning from aching muscles and bones.</p><p>While we rested in a cave that was faintly lit by glowing moss, I started wondering how Magda knew about these tunnels. I guessed she must have wandered in here when she was younger - perhaps lost, starving, separated from her pack - and found her way up, through trial and error, to safety, warmth, and food. If that was the case, she had a truly incredible memory. I was marveling at this - and at the memories of animals in general - when Streak's nose lifted sharply. He sniffed the air, then got to his paws and padded to the mouth of the tunnel leading out of the cave. The younger wolves joined him, and all three bared their fangs and growled.</p><p>I was instantly alert. Picking up a sharp stone, I rose to investigate the cause of their concern. But as I was crossing the cave, focusing on the wolves, a slim figure emerged suddenly and silently from the shadows overhead, knocked me to the ground, and roughly jammed a large bone between my lips, choking me and cutting short my panicked cry.</p><p>Chapter TEN</p><p>As I raised my hands to fight,the three male wolves began to bark - but not at me or my assailant. They were focused on some other danger, farther up the tunnel, and took no notice of the trouble I was in. Nor did Magda, who lay peacefully where she was and gazed at me with a curious but unalarmed expression.</p><p>Before I could strike, the person holding me said something that sounded like \"Gurlabashta!\" I tried to shout in response but could manage only a muffled grunt because of the bone jammed between my teeth. \"Gurlabashta!\" my attacker snapped again, then eased the bone out and pressed a couple of dry fingers to my lips.</p><p>Realizing my life wasn't under threat, I relaxed and suspiciously studied the person who'd knocked me to the floor. With a start, I saw that it was one of the pale-skinned, white-eyed Guardians of the Blood. He was a thin, anxious-looking man. Putting a finger to his own lips, he pointed at the wolves - barking louder than ever - then up at the roof of the cave, where he'd dropped from. Pushing me over to the wall, he pointed out fingerholds in the rocks, then scrambled up into the darkness. I lingered doubtfully a moment, then glanced at the agitated wolves and followed him up.</p><p>There was a crevice at the top of the wall, which the Guardian guided me into. He slid into a small hole close by. I waited in silence, my heart beating loudly. Then I heard a voice addressing the angry wolves. \"Quiet!\" someone hissed. \"Shut up, you mongrels!\"</p><p>The wolves quit howling, but they continued growling menacingly. They backed away from the tunnel mouth, and moments later I saw a purple-skinned face poke out of the shadows - a vampaneze!</p><p>\"Wolves,\" the vampaneze snarled, spitting on the ground. \"Curse their eyes!\"</p><p>\"Leave them be,\" a second vampaneze said behind him. \"They won't interfere with us if we keep out of their way. They're just scavenging for food.\"</p><p>\"If they keep yapping, they could bring the vampires down on us,\" the first vampaneze murmured ominously, and I saw the blade of a sharp knife glint by his side.</p><p>\"They're only barking because of us,\" his companion said, dragging him away. \"They'll stop once we...?</p><p>Their voices faded and I didn't hear them after that.</p><p>When I was sure the way was clear, I looked over to where the Guardian of the Blood was hiding, to thank him for his unexpected help - but he wasn't there. He must have slipped away while I wasn't looking. I shook my head with confusion. I'd thought the Guardians were in league with the vampaneze, since one of them had ignored my cries for help when I was fleeing from Kurda and his allies, and left me to them. Why help me now when they'd abandoned me then?</p><p>Thinking it over, I climbed down and rejoined the wolves. They were still sniffing the air guardedly but had stopped growling. After a while, we followed Magda out of the cave as she resumed her way and led us farther up the mountain. She slinked ahead even slower than before, though I didn't know if this was because of exhaustion or the threat of the vampaneze.</p><p>A few hours later, we reached the lower Halls at the top of the mountain and skirted around them. We passed disturbingly close to the storerooms at one point. I could hear vampires at work behind the walls, getting ready for the large feast that would follow Kurda's investiture. I held my breath and listened for a few minutes, but their words were muffled, and I soon moved on, afraid one of them would discover us.</p><p>I kept expecting Magda to stop, but she led us higher and higher, farther up the mountain than I thought possible. I was beginning to think we must be almost at the very top when we came to a tunnel that cut upward sharply. Magda studied the tunnel, then turned and gazed at me - I could tell by the look in her eyes that she'd brought me as far as she could. As I dashed forward, eager to check where the tunnel led, Magda turned and limped away.</p><p>\"Where are you going?\" I called. The she-wolf paused and glanced back, tired resignation in her stare - she couldn't manage the climb. \"Wait here and we'll collect you later,\" I told her. Magda snarled, pawed the ground, and ruffled her fur - and I got the sense that she was going away to die. \"No,\" I said softly. \"If you just lie down and rest, I'm sure -?</p><p>Magda interrupted with a short shake of her head. Staring into her sad eyes, I began to comprehend that this was what she wanted. She'd known when she started that the journey would prove too much for her. She'd chosen to make it all the same and die usefully, rather than struggle along after the pack for another season or two, dying slowly and miserably. She was prepared for death and welcomed it.</p><p>Crouching, I ran my hands over the tired she-wolf's head and gently rubbed the thin hairs on her ears. \"Thank you,\" I said simply. Magda licked me, rubbed her nose against my left cheek, then hobbled away into darkness, to find a private spot where she could lie down and quietly leave this world behind.</p>","<p>I remained where I was awhile, thinking about death and how the wolf had accepted it so calmly, remembering how I'd run when it had been my time to face it. Then, shrugging off such dark thoughts, I entered the tunnel and climbed.</p><p>The wolves had a harder time on the final stretch than I did. Even though they were great climbers, the rock was steep, unsuited to sharp claws, and they kept slipping to the bottom. Finally, tired of hanging about, I slid down and let the wolves go ahead of me, using my head and shoulders to brace them when they lost their footing.</p><p>Several minutes later, we found ourselves on level ground, in a small, dark cave. The air here was musty, made worse by the strong stench of the hairy wolves. \"You three wait here,\" I told them in a whisper, afraid their smell would carry to any nearby vampires. Shuffling forward, I came to a wall of thin, fragile rock. Dim light shone through several tiny holes and cracks. I pressed my eyes to the holes, but they were too small to see through. Inserting the nail of my right little finger into one of the larger cracks, I worked gently at the stone, which crumbled, widening the hole. Leaning forward, I was able to see through to the other side - and was astonished to find myself at the rear of the Hall of Princes!</p><p>Once I'd recovered from the shock - there was only supposed to be one way up to the Hall of Princes! - I began considering my next course of action. This had worked out far more neatly than I'd ever dared to dream, and it was now up to me to make the most of my incredible good fortune. My first instinct was to burst through the wall and scream for the Princes, but the guards of the Hall or one of the traitors might cut me down if I did, killing my message with me.</p><p>Retreating from the wall, I returned to the wolves and led them back down the steep tunnel, where there was more space and air. Once comfortable, I lay down, closed my eyes, and began thinking about how to make contact with the Princes - while at the same time avoiding the spears and swords of the vicious traitors and well-meaning guards!</p><p>Chapter ELEVEN</p><p>Iwanted to speak to the Princes directly - but I couldn't just march up to the doors of the Hall and ask the guards to let me in! I could wait for one of the Princes to emerge and hail him, but they didn't leave the throne room very often. What if Kurda made his move before I could act? I thought about sneaking down to the doors and slipping in the next time they were open, but it was unlikely that I could avoid the attention of the guards. Besides, if Kurda was inside and saw me, he might kill me before I had a chance to speak.</p><p>That was my greatest fear - that I'd be killed before I warned the Princes of the peril they faced. With this in mind, I decided I had to contact somebody before approaching the Princes, so that if I died, my message wouldn't die with me.</p><p>But who to trust? Mr. Crepsley or Harkat were the ideal choices, but there was no way I could make it to their cells undetected. Arra Sails and Vanez Blane also dwelt too deep within the mountain to be easily reached.</p><p>That left Seba Nile, the ancient quartermaster of Vampire Mountain. His cell was close to the storerooms. It would be risky, but I thought I could get to him without being seen. But could I trust him? He and Kurda were close friends. He'd helped the traitor make maps of infrequently used tunnels, maps that the vampaneze might be using at this very minute to advance on the Hall of Princes. Was it possible that he was one of Kurda's allies?</p><p>Almost as soon as I raised the question, I knew it was ridiculous. Seba was an old-fashioned vampire, who believed in loyalty and the ways of the vampires above all else. And he'd been Mr. Crepsley's mentor. If I couldn't trust Seba, I couldn't trust anybody.</p><p>I rose to go in search of Seba, and the wolves rose with me. Crouching, I told them to stay. Streak shook his head, growling, but I was firm with him. \"Stay!\" I commanded. \"Wait for me. If I don't come back, return to the pack. This isn't your fight. There's nothing you can do.\"</p><p>I wasn't sure if Streak understood all that, but he squatted on his haunches and remained with the other wolves, panting heavily as he watched me leave, his dark eyes fixed on me until I vanished around a bend.</p><p>Retracing the path by which we'd come, I climbed back down the mountain. It didn't take long to reach the storerooms. They were quiet when I arrived, but I entered cautiously, taking no chances, through the hole that Kurda had revealed to me during my escape.</p><p>Finding nobody within, I started for the door leading to the tunnels, then stopped and glanced down at myself. I'd grown so used to being na**d, I'd forgotten how strange I'd look to nonanimal eyes. If I turned up in Seba's quarters like this, dirty and wild, he might think I was a ghost!</p><p>There were no spare clothes in this room, so I ripped apart an old sack and tied a strip of it around my waist. It wasn't much of an improvement, but it would have to do. I tied another few strips around my feet, so that I could pad more stealthily, then opened a sack of flour and rubbed a few handfuls of the white powder over my body, hopefully to mask the worst of my wolfish smell. When I was ready, I opened the door and crept into the tunnel.</p><p>Though it would normally have taken no more than two or three minutes to get to Seba's rooms, I spent nearly four times as long, checking each stretch of tunnel several times before venturing down it, making sure I had somewhere to hide if vampires emerged unexpectedly.</p><p>When I finally reached the old quartermaster's door, I was shaking with anxiety and stood in silence a few seconds, collecting myself. When I'd recovered, I knocked lightly. \"Come in,\" Seba called. I entered. The quartermaster was standing by a chest with his back to me. \"Over here, Thomas,\" he muttered, examining the inside of the chest. \"I told you not to bother knocking. The investiture is a mere two hours away. We do not have time for -?</p><p>Turning, he saw me, and his jaw literally dropped.</p><p>\"Hello, Seba.\" I smiled nervously.</p><p>Seba blinked, shook his head, blinked again. \"Darren?\" he gasped.</p><p>\"The one and only.\" I grinned.</p><p>Seba lowered the lid of the chest and sat upon it heavily. \"Are you a vision?\" he wheezed.</p><p>\"Do I look like one?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" he said.</p><p>I laughed and advanced. \"I'm no vision, Seba. It's me. I'm real.\" I stopped in front of him. \"Feel me if you don't believe me.\"</p><p>Seba reached out a trembling finger and touched my left arm. When he realized I was solid, he beamed and rose. Then his face fell, and he sat again. \"You were sentenced to death,\" he said dolefully.</p><p>\"I figured as much,\" I said, nodding.</p><p>\"You fled.\"</p><p>\"It was a mistake. I'm sorry.\"</p><p>\"We thought you drowned. Your trail led to the stream and ended abruptly. How did you get out?\"</p><p>\"I swam,\" I said lightly.</p><p>\"Swam where?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Down the stream.\"</p><p>\"You mean... all the way... through the mountain? That is impossible!\"</p><p>\"Improbable,\" I corrected him. \"Not impossible. I wouldn't be here if it was.\"</p><p>\"And Gavner?\" he asked hopefully. \"Is he alive too?\"</p><p>I shook my head sadly. \"Gavner's dead. He was murdered.\"</p><p>\"I thought so,\" Seba sighed. \"But when I saw you, I -\" He stopped and frowned. \"Murdered?\" he rumbled.</p><p>\"You'd better stay sitting,\" I said, then proceeded to tell him the bare bones of my encounter with the vampaneze, Kurda's treachery, and what happened after.</p><p>Seba was shaking with rage when I finished. \"Never did I think a vampire would turn against his brothers,\" he growled. \"And one so highly respected! It sickens and shames me. To think I have drunk blood to that sham of a vampire's good health and prayed to the gods to grant him luck! Charna's guts!\"</p><p>\"You believe me?\" I asked, relieved.</p><p>\"I might not recognize treachery when it is skillfully concealed,\" he said, \"but I know the truth when it is revealed. I believe you. The Princes will too.\" Rising, he strode for the door. \"We must hurry to warn them. The sooner we -\" He paused. \"No. The Princes will see no one until the time of investiture. They reside within their Hall and will not open the doors until twilight, when Kurda presents himself. That is the way it has always been. I would be turned away if I went there now.\"</p><p>\"But you'll be able to get to them in time?\" I asked anxiously.</p><p>He nodded. \"There is a lengthy ceremony before the investiture. I will have plenty of time to interrupt and level these grievous charges against our supposed ally, Kurda Smahlt.\" The vampire was seething with rage. \"Come to think of it,\" he said, eyes narrowing, \"he is alone in his chambers now. I could go and slit the villain's throat before-\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said quickly. \"The Princes will want to question him. We don't know who else is working with them, or why he did it.\"</p><p>\"You are right,\" he sighed, shoulders slumping.</p><p>\"Besides, killing him would be a mercy. He deserves to suffer for what he did to Gavner.\"</p><p>\"That's not the only reason why I don't want you to kill him,\" I said hesitantly. Seba stared at me and waited for me to continue. \"I want to blow the whistle on him. I was with Gavner when he died. He was down in the tunnels because of me. I want to look into Kurda's eyes when I expose him.\"</p><p>\"To show him how much you hate him?\" Seba asked.</p><p>\"No,\" I said. \"To show him how much pain he's caused.\" There were tears in my eyes. \"I hate him, Seba, but I still think of him as a friend. He saved my life. I'd be dead now if he hadn't intervened. I want him to know how much he's hurt me. Maybe it doesn't make sense, but I want him to see that I don't get any pleasure out of exposing him as a traitor.\"</p><p>Seba nodded slowly. \"It makes sense,\" he said, stroking his chin and considering the proposal. \"But it is dangerous. I do not think the guards will kill you, but one of Kurda's allies might.\"</p><p>\"I'll take that chance,\" I said. \"What do I have to lose? I'll be killed afterward anyway, because I failed the Trials. I'd rather die on my feet, stopping Kurda, than in the Hall of Death.\"</p><p>Seba smiled warmly. \"You are a true, courageous vampire, Darren Shan,\" he said.</p><p>\"No,\" I replied softly. \"I'm just trying to do the right thing, to make up for running away earlier.\"</p><p>\"Larten will be proud of you,\" Seba remarked.</p><p>I couldn't think of anything to say to that, so I just blushed and shrugged. Then we sat down together and discussed various plans for the night ahead.</p><p>Chapter TWELVE</p><p>Ididn't really want to involve the wolves any further - in case they were killed - but they remained seated, panting patiently, when I tried chasing them off. \"Go!\" I said, slapping their flanks. \"Home!\" But they weren't dogs, and they didn't obey. I saw they planned to stick by me - the younger wolves even looked like they were relishing the thought of a fight - so I gave up trying to drive them to safety and instead settled back to wait for nightfall, judging the time by my internal body clock.</p><p>As the day was drawing to a close, the wolves and I crawled back up the steep tunnel and made our way to the wall at the rear of the Hall of Princes. I set to work on the soft layer of rock and carefully carved out a gap big enough for us to squeeze through. I was surprised nobody had ever found this weak point before, but it was very high up, and from the other side the wall must have looked solid.</p><p>I paused briefly to consider the extraordinary run of luck I was enjoying. Surviving the gushing madness of the mountain stream, Rudi and Streak finding me when I was at my weakest, Magda leading us through the tunnels to the Hall of Princes. Even failing the Trials had been in one respect fortunate - I'd never have found out about the vampaneze if I hadn't lost against the Blooded Boars.</p><p>Was it really just the luck of the vampires, or was it something more - like destiny? I'd never believed in fate, but I was beginning to have my doubts!</p><p>Sounds of the approaching procession distracted me from my heavy thoughts. The hour of Kurda's investiture had come. It was time to act. Wriggling through the hole, I dropped to the floor, turned, and caught the wolves as they slithered down. When we were all ready, we flattened close to the wall of the Hall and edged forward.</p><p>As we slipped around the curve of the dome, I saw the Generals who'd lined up to welcome Kurda Smahlt. They'd formed a guard of honor, stretching from the tunnel to the doors of the Hall. Almost all were armed, as were the rest of the vampires - the ceremony of investiture was the one time vampires could carry weapons into the chamber. Any one of the armed vampires could be a traitor, with orders to kill me on sight. I tried not to dwell on that horrible thought, for fear it might stop me.</p><p>The three Princes stood by the open doors of the dome, dressed regally, waiting to blood Kurda and make him one of their own. I spotted Mr. Crepsley and Seba close to the Princes. Mr. Crepsley was staring in the direction of the tunnel - along with everybody else - but Seba had an eye out for me. When he caught sight of me, he nodded slightly. That meant he'd had words with a few of his staff and had positioned them nearby, with orders to stop any vampire who raised a weapon during the ceremony. Seba hadn't told his assistants about me - we'd agreed it was best to keep my presence a secret - and I hoped they wouldn't hesitate when I made my move, thus giving one of Kurda's men the chance to kill me.</p><p>The head of the procession entered the cave. Six vampires preceded Kurda, walking slowly in pairs, carrying the clothes that Kurda would put on once he'd been invested. Next came two deep-voiced vampires, loudly chanting poems and stories, praising the Princes and Kurda. There were more of the chanting vampires behind, and their hymnlike tones carried up the tunnel and echoed around the cave.</p>","<p>Behind the first eight vampires came the vampire of the moment, Kurda Smahlt, carried on a small platform by four Generals, wearing a loose white robe, blond head bowed, eyes closed. I waited until he was halfway between the tunnel and the Princes, then stepped out from the wall, strode forward - the wolves close on my heels - and shouted as loud as I could, \"STOP!\"</p><p>All heads turned, and the chanting ceased immediately. Hardly any of the vampires recognized me at first - all they saw was a dirty, half-naked boy, covered in flour - but as I got closer, they gasped and exclaimed. \"Darren!\" Mr. Crepsley roared with delight as he started toward me, arms outstretched. I ignored my mentor and stayed focused on the rest of the vampires, alert to signs of retaliation.</p><p>The traitors didn't delay. Two vampires in green uniforms raised their spears when they saw me, while another pulled out a pair of knives and moved forward to intercept me. Seba's men reacted splendidly, ignoring the confusion, and darted forward to apprehend the spear-wielding vampires. They dragged them to the ground before they could launch their weapons, disarmed them, and held them down.</p><p>But nobody could get to the vampire with the knives - he was too far ahead of Seba's assistants. He broke through the ranks of guards, pushed Mr. Crepsley out of the way, and raced toward me. He threw one of the knives, but I ducked out of its way with ease. Before he could throw the other or get close enough to stick it into me, the two young wolves launched themselves at him and knocked him to the floor. They bit and clawed at him, howling with excitement and fury. He shrieked and tried fighting them off, but they were too powerful.</p><p>One of the wolves sank its teeth into the vampire's throat and made a brutal end of him. I didn't mind - I was only concerned about not harming innocent vampires, and by the speed with which this one had reacted, and the determination he'd shown to kill me, he was without a doubt one of Kurda's accomplices.</p><p>The other vampires in the cave had frozen with shock. Even Mr. Crepsley stopped where he was, eyes wide, panting uncertainly. \"Darren?\" he asked shakily. \"What is going on? How did -?</p><p>\"Not now!\" I snapped, looking for traitors. There didn't appear to be any more, but I wasn't taking things for granted, not until I'd said my piece. \"I'll tell you about it later,\" I promised Mr. Crepsley, then calmly walked past him to face Kurda and the Princes. Streak padded along by my side, watching out for me, growling warningly.</p><p>Kurda had opened his eyes and raised his head at the start of the commotion, but had made no attempt to flee the platform or the cave. He stared at me with hard-to-read eyes as I advanced, more wistful than panicky, then rubbed the three small scars on his left cheek (made by the vampaneze when he was discussing peace terms with them some years before) and sighed.</p><p>\"What's going on?\" Mika Ver Leth roared, his expression as black as the clothes he wore. \"Why are those vampires fighting? Break them apart immediately!\"</p><p>\"Sire!\" Seba said quickly, before the order could be obeyed. \"Those who raised weapons against Darren are not our allies. Those who hold them down do so at my command. I would strongly advise against releasing them until you have heard Darren speak.\"</p><p>Mika stared hard at the calm old quartermaster. \"You're part of this chaos, Seba?\" he asked.</p><p>\"I am, sire,\" Seba said, \"and proud to be.\"</p><p>\"That boy fled from the judgment of the Princes,\" Arrow growled, the veins in his bald head throbbing. \"He is not welcome here.\"</p><p>\"He will be, sire, when you learn why he has come,\" Seba insisted.</p><p>\"This is most objectionable,\" Paris Skyle said. \"Never before has anyone interrupted the investiture of a Prince. I do not know why you are siding with the boy, but I think the two of you should be removed from the Hall until later, when we can -?</p><p>\"No!\" I shouted, pushing through the ranks of guards to stand directly before the Princes. Locking gazes with them, I growled so that all could hear. \"You say nobody has ever interrupted the investiture of a Prince, and this might be true. But I say no one has ever sought to invest a traitor before, so it's time that -?</p><p>The cave erupted with furious roars. The vampires were incensed that I'd called Kurda a traitor (even those who hadn't voted for his investiture), and before I could make any moves to protect myself, a horde surged around me and started kicking, punching, and tearing at me. The three wolves tried dashing to my rescue but were easily pushed away by the crowd of vampires.</p><p>\"Stop this!\" the Princes roared. \"Stop! Stop! Stop!\"</p><p>Finally, the commands of the Princes seeped through, and those who'd surrounded me released me and shuffled backward, eyes aflame with anger, muttering darkly. They hadn't hurt me - the press had been too tight for any of them to get in a decent blow.</p><p>\"This is a grim night,\" Mika Ver Leth grumbled. \"It's bad enough that a boy violates our laws and customs, but when fully blooded vampires who should know better behave like a pack of barbarians in the presence of their Princes...\" He shook his head, disgusted.</p><p>\"But he called Kurda a traitor!\" someone yelled out, and tempers flared again, as vampires hurled curses at me.</p><p>\"Enough!\" Mika bellowed. When silence had fallen, he fixed his gaze on me. He looked only slightly less enraged than those who'd attacked me. \"Were it up to me,\" he snarled, \"I'd have you bound and gagged before you could say another word. Then I'd see you hauled off to the Hall of Death, where you'd suffer the fate you deserve.\"</p><p>He paused and glared around at the vampires, who were nodding and murmuring approvingly. Then his eyes alighted on Seba and he frowned. \"But one we all know, trust, and admire has spoken up on your behalf. I have no respect for half-vampires who flee instead of standing to face their punishment, but Seba Nile says we should pay attention to what you have to say, and I for one am loath to disregard him.\"</p><p>\"I agree with that,\" Paris Skyle grunted.</p><p>Arrow looked troubled. \"I also respect Seba,\" he said, \"but such a breach of decorum is deplorable. I think...\" Looking hard at Seba, he changed his mind and nodded gruffly. \"Very well. I'll side with Paris and Mika. But only for Seba's sake.\"</p><p>Turning to me, looking as kindly as he could given the circumstances, Paris said, \"Say your piece, Darren - but make it quick.\"</p><p>\"OK,\" I agreed, glancing up at Kurda, who was staring at me wordlessly. \"Let's see if this is quick enough for you - Kurda Smahlt killed Gavner Purl.\" The vampires gasped, and looks of hatred were replaced with frowns of uncertainty. \"At this very moment, dozens of vampaneze lurk in the tunnels beneath us, waiting to attack,\" I continued. Stunned silence greeted my words. \"They were invited here by him!\" I pointed at Kurda, and this time no voices were raised in anger. \"He's a traitor,\" I whispered, and as all eyes locked on Kurda, mine dropped, and a couple of confused tears rolled down my cheeks and fell to the dusty cavern floor.</p><p>Chapter THIRTEEN</p><p>Alengthy silence followed my accusations. Nobody knew what to say or think. If Kurda had vehemently denied the claims made against him, perhaps the Generals would have rallied to his side. But he just stood there, downcast, suffering their questioning stares without reply.</p><p>Finally, Paris Skyle cleared his throat. \"These are grave charges to bring against any vampire,\" he said. \"To level them at a Prince-to-be while he stands on the point of investiture...\" He shook his head. \"You understand what the consequences will be if you are lying?\"</p><p>\"Why would I lie?\" I retorted. Turning, I faced the ranks of vampires. \"Everyone knows I failed my Trials of Initiation and fled before I could be killed. By returning, I've condemned myself to execution. Do you think I'd do that for no good reason?\" Nobody answered. \"Kurda betrayed you! He's in league with the vampaneze. I think he plans on letting them into the Hall of Princes once he's been invested, to seize control of the Stone of Blood.\"</p><p>There were cries of astonishment at that.</p><p>\"How do you know this?\" Arrow yelled over the noise. The bald prince hated the vampaneze more than most, because one of them had killed his wife many years ago.</p><p>\"I'm only guessing about the Stone of Blood,\" I replied, \"but I've seen the vampaneze. Gavner saw them too. That's why Kurda murdered him. He'd have spared my life, but I threw myself into the stream in the Hall of Final Voyage. I was sure I'd die, but I survived. Once I'd recovered, I came back here to warn you.\"</p><p>\"How many vampaneze are down there?\" Arrow asked, eyes blazing.</p><p>\"At least thirty - possibly more.\"</p><p>The three Princes glanced at each other uneasily.</p><p>\"This makes no sense,\" Mika muttered.</p><p>\"I agree,\" Arrow said. \"But a lie this outlandish would be simple to disprove. If he wished to fool us, he would have chosen a less fantastic story.\"</p><p>\"Besides,\" Paris sighed, \"look in the boy's eyes - there is nothing but truth in them.\"</p><p>A roar disrupted the conversation. One of Kurda's accomplices had broken free and grabbed a knife from a General. Before he could get away, the guards closed ranks and encircled him. He prepared to fight to the death.</p><p>\"No, Cyrus!\" Kurda bellowed, his first words since I'd disrupted the procession. The vampire's hand dropped, and he looked to Kurda for guidance. \"It's over,\" Kurda said softly. \"Don't spill blood unnecessarily. That was never our aim.\"</p><p>The vampire named Cyrus nodded obediently. Then, before the circle of guards could close in on him, he put the tip of the knife to his heart and made a swift, fatal stab. As the dead traitor fell to the floor, all eyes turned once again to Kurda, and this time the faces of the vampires were grim.</p><p>\"What have you to say in rebuttal of Darren's claims?\" Mika asked, his voice thick with emotion.</p><p>\"At this moment - nothing,\" Kurda responded coolly.</p><p>\"You don't deny the charge?\" Arrow shouted.</p><p>\"I do not,\" Kurda said.</p><p>A horrified moan swept through the cave at Kurda's admission of guilt.</p><p>\"Let's kill him now!\" Arrow growled, to a huge cheer of approval.</p><p>\"With respect, sires,\" Seba interceded, \"would it not make more sense to focus on the vampaneze before we execute our own? Kurda can wait - we should deal with the intruders first.\"</p><p>\"Seba is right,\" Paris said. \"The vampaneze must be put to the sword. There will be time for traitors later.\"</p><p>Turning to a handful of guards, he told them to take Kurda and the other traitor away and hold them captive. \"And under no circumstances let them take their own lives,\" he warned. \"That would be the easy way out. Keep them alive until we have time to interrogate them.\"</p><p>Beckoning me forward, he addressed the massed vampires. \"We will retire to the Hall of Princes with Darren. I ask the rest of you to remain here while we discuss the ramifications of this horrific turn of events. When we have decided on an immediate course of action, we shall inform you. There will be open talks later, when the present danger has been dealt with.\"</p><p>\"And see that no one leaves the cave,\" Mika barked. \"We don't know how deep this conspiracy runs. I don't want word of this reaching the ears of those who stand opposed to the welfare of our clan.\"</p><p>With that, the four of us entered the Hall of Princes, followed by several of the more senior Generals, as well as Seba, Arra Sails, and Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>Some of the tension seeped out of the air when the doors closed behind us. Paris hurried off to check on the Stone of Blood, while Mika and Arrow trudged disconsolately to their thrones. Seba thrust some clothes into my hands and told me to slip them on. I did so quickly, then let the quartermaster lead me forward to speak with the Princes. I still hadn't had a chance to have a word with Mr. Crepsley, though I smiled at him to show that I was thinking about him.</p><p>I started by telling the Princes about my flight through the tunnels with Kurda, Gavner coming after us, changing direction, running into the vampaneze, Gavner making his stand, and Kurda's betrayal. When I got to the part about the stream, Paris clapped his hands loudly and grinned.</p><p>\"I never would have believed it,\" the one-eared Prince chuckled admiringly. \"Young vampires overeager to prove themselves used to go down it in barrels hundreds of years ago, but none ever tried -?</p><p>\"Please, Paris,\" Mika complained. \"Let's leave the reminiscences till later.\"</p><p>\"Of course.\" Paris coughed meekly. \"Do continue.\"</p><p>I told them about washing up on a bank far away from Vampire Mountain, being found by the wolves and nursed back to health.</p><p>\"That is not so extraordinary,\" Mr. Crepsley interrupted. \"Wolves have often taken care of abandoned children.\"</p><p>I described how I'd seen Mr. Crepsley and Arra searching for me, but had kept my head down because of Kurda and the sword-wielding vampires.</p><p>\"These two traitors,\" Mika said darkly. \"Did you spot them in the cave?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said. \"They were two of the three who tried to kill me. The vampire stopped by the wolves was one. The other was captured and taken away with Kurda.\"</p><p>\"I wonder how many more were part of this,\" Mika mused.</p><p>\"In my estimation - none,\" Paris said.</p><p>\"You think there were only four of them?\" Mika asked.</p><p>Paris nodded. \"Vampires are not easily turned against their own. The three with Kurda were young, and if I remember correctly, all were blooded by him - the only three he ever blooded. Also, it is logical to assume that anyone conspiring with him would have been in the cave to witness his investiture. They would surely have acted along with the others to silence Darren before he could speak.</p>","<p>\"I do not suggest we dismiss the possibility that there are one or two more we should be wary of,\" Paris concluded, \"but it would be unhelpful to believe the rot is widespread. This is a time to pull together as one, not set in motion a series of unsettling witch hunts.\"</p><p>\"I agree with Paris,\" Arrow said. \"The suspicion must be stamped out before it has a chance to take hold. If we fail to reestablish trust quickly, no vampire will be able to place faith in another, and anarchy will be rampant.\"</p><p>I hurried through the rest of my story, bringing them up to date, telling them about Magda, my climb through the tunnels, how I contacted Seba to make sure word of Kurda's treachery wouldn't die with me if I was killed. I also mentioned the Guardians of the Blood, how one had failed to help when I cried out to him in the Hall of Final Voyage, but how another had come to my rescue during my climb up the mountain.</p><p>\"The Guardians of the Blood keep their own counsel,\" Seba said - he knew more about the Guardians than most. \"They are loath to interfere directly in our affairs, which is why they would not have reported to us when they learned about the vampaneze. But indirect interference - such as hiding you when danger loomed - is permitted. Their neutrality is exasperating but in keeping with their ways and customs. We should not hold it against them.\"</p><p>There was a long, thoughtful silence when I finished, broken eventually by Mika Ver Leth, who smiled wryly and said, \"You put the clan's interests before your own. We cannot overlook your Trials of Initiation failure, or the fact that you ran from sentencing - but any dishonor you incurred has been canceled out by this act of selfless dedication. You are a true vampire, Darren Shan, as worthy to walk the night as any I know.\"</p><p>I bowed my head to hide my shy smile.</p><p>\"Enough of the praise,\" Arrow grunted. \"There are vampaneze to kill. I won't rest until every last one has been hung over the stakes in the Hall of Death and dropped a dozen times. Let's storm down there and -?</p><p>\"Easy, my friend,\" Paris said, laying a calming hand on the Prince's arm. \"We must not rush into this. Our best trackers followed Darren's trail through the tunnels, passing close to the caves where the vampaneze were camped. Kurda would have thought of this and relocated them, so they would not be discovered. Our first priority must be to find them. Even after that, we must tread carefully, for fear they hear us coming and get away.\"</p><p>\"Very well,\" Arrow groaned. \"But I'm leading the first wave against them!\"</p><p>\"I have no objection to that,\" Paris said. \"Mika?\"</p><p>\"Arrow may lead the first wave,\" Mika agreed, \"as long as I can lead the second, and he leaves enough for me to whet my blade on.\"</p><p>\"It's a deal.\" Arrow laughed, the glint of battle lust in his eyes.</p><p>\"So young and bloodthirsty,\" Paris sighed. \"I suppose that means I have to stay behind and guard the Hall.\"</p><p>\"One of us will relieve you before the end,\" Mika promised. \"We'll let you mop up the stragglers.\"</p><p>\"You are too kind.\" Paris grinned, then grew serious. \"But that comes later. First, let us summon our best trackers. Darren will go with them to show them the inhabited caves. Once we -?</p><p>\"Sires,\" Seba interrupted. \"Darren has not eaten since leaving the pack of wolves and has not partaken of human blood since departing Vampire Mountain. May I feed him before you send him off on so important a mission?\"</p><p>\"Of course,\" Paris said. \"Take him to the Hall of Khledon Lurt and give him whatever he wants. We will send for him presently.\"</p><p>Though I'd have rather stayed and discussed the situation with the Princes, I was starving, and offered no protest as Seba led me away, through the cave of vampires, down to the Hall of Khledon Lurt. In the Hall, I tucked into one of the most satisfying meals of my life, not forgetting to offer up a prayer of silent thanks to the gods of the vampires for helping me through my great ordeal - while asking them to guide all of us safely through the hardships still to come.</p><p>Chapter FOURTEEN</p><p>Mr. crepsley brought harkatto see me while I was eating. The Little Person hadn't been allowed to attend the investiture - only vampires were permitted at the prestigious event - and knew nothing about my return until he walked into the Hall and spotted me shoveling food down my throat. \"Darren!\" he gasped, hurrying forward.</p><p>\"'Lo, Harkat,\" I mumbled around a mouthful of fried rat.</p><p>\"What are... you doing... here? Did they... catch you?\"</p><p>\"Not exactly. I gave myself up.\"</p><p>\"Why?\"</p><p>\"Don't ask me to explain it now,\" I pleaded. \"I've just finished telling the Princes. You'll pick the story up soon enough. Tell me what's been happening while I was away.\"</p><p>\"Nothing much,\" Harkat said. \"The vampires were... furious when they... found out you'd fled. I told them... I knew... nothing about it. They didn't... believe me, but I... stuck to my... story, so there was... nothing they could... do.\"</p><p>\"He would not even tell me the truth,\" Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>I looked at the vampire, ashamed of myself. \"I'm sorry I ran away,\" I muttered.</p><p>\"So you should be,\" he grunted. \"It was not like you, Darren.\"</p><p>\"I know.\" I moped. \"I could blame Kurda - I wouldn't have run if he hadn't talked me into it - but the truth is I was scared and seized the opportunity to get away when it presented itself. It wasn't just dying that I was worried about - there was also the walk to that horrible Hall of Death, then being hung above the stakes and...\" I shivered at the thought.</p><p>\"Do not chastise yourself too much,\" Mr. Crepsley said softly. \"I am more to blame for letting them subject you to the Trials in the first place. I should have insisted upon a suitable period of time to prepare for the Trials and the consequences of failure. The fault is ours, not yours. You reacted as anyone who had not been fully versed in the ways of the vampires would have.\"</p><p>\"I say it was fate,\" Seba murmured. \"Had he not fled, we would never have been alerted to Kurda's treacherous nature or the presence of the vampaneze.\"</p><p>\"The hands of... fate keep time... on a heart-shaped... watch,\" Harkat said, and we all turned to stare at him.</p><p>\"What does that mean?\" I asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \"I'm not sure. It just... popped into my... head. It's something Mr... Tiny used to say.\"</p><p>We looked at each other uneasily, thinking about Mr. Tiny and the heart-shaped watch he was so fond of playing with.</p><p>\"You think Desmond Tiny could have had something to do with this?\" Seba asked.</p><p>\"I do not see how,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"I believe Darren had the natural luck of the vampires on his side. On the other hand, where that dark horse Tiny is concerned - who knows?\"</p><p>While we sat puzzling it over - the meddling fingers of fate, or sheer good fortune? - a messenger from the Princes arrived, and I was escorted through the lower Halls and tunnels to join the trackers and set off in search of the vampaneze.</p><p>Vanez Blane - who'd trained me for my Trials - was among the five chosen trackers. The one-eyed games master took my hands in his and squeezed hard by way of greeting. \"I knew you would not desert us,\" he said. \"Others cursed you, but I was sure you'd return once you had time to think things through. I told them it was a poor decision made in haste, which you'd soon correct.\"</p><p>\"I bet you didn't bet on me returning.\" I grinned.</p><p>\"Now that you mention it - no, I didn't,\" he laughed. Vanez examined my feet to make sure my padding was adequate. All the trackers were wearing soft shoes. He offered to find a pair for me, but I said I'd stick with the pieces of sack.</p><p>\"We must proceed with utmost caution,\" he warned. \"No sudden movements, no lights, and no talking. Communicate by hand signals. And take this.\" He gave me a long, sharp knife. \"If you have to use it, don't hesitate.\"</p><p>\"I won't,\" I swore, thinking about the knife that had savagely cut short the life of my friend Gavner Purl.</p><p>Down we went, as silently as we could. I'm not sure I could have found the way back to the cave on my own - I hadn't been paying attention to the route that night - but the trackers had followed the trail I'd left when they came looking for me and knew which way to go.</p><p>We crawled through the tunnel under the stream. It wasn't as frightening this time, not after all I'd been through since I last passed this way. As we stood, I pointed wordlessly to the tunnel that connected the small cave to the larger one. Two of the trackers advanced and checked on the cave beyond. I listened intently for sounds of a struggle, but there weren't any. Moments later, one of the trackers returned and shook his head. The rest of us trailed after him into the bigger cave.</p><p>My insides tightened when I saw that the cave was deserted. It looked as if it had been empty since the beginning of time. I had a bad feeling that we'd be unable to find the vampaneze and I'd be called a liar. Vanez, sensing this, nudged me gently and winked. \"It'll be OK,\" he mouthed, then joined the others, who were exploring the cave cautiously.</p><p>\"It didn't take the trackers long to uncover evidence of the vampaneze and calm my fears. One found a scrap of cloth, another a fragment from a broken bowl, another a small pool of spit where a vampaneze had cleared his throat. When they'd gathered enough evidence, we returned to the smaller cave, where we held a quiet conversation, safe in the knowledge that the roar of the stream would cover our voices.</p><p>\"It was vampaneze all right,\" one of the trackers said. \"A couple of dozen at least.\"</p><p>\"They covered their tracks admirably,\" another grunted. \"We only unearthed them because we knew what to look for. We'd never have noticed if we'd been giving the cave a quick once-over.\"</p><p>\"Where do you think they are now?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Hard to say,\" Vanez mused, scratching the lid of his blind eye. \"There aren't a lot of caves nearby where that many vampaneze could hide comfortably. But they may have split into smaller groups and scattered.\"</p><p>\"I doubt it,\" one of the others remarked. \"If I was in charge of them, I'd want everyone to stick close together, in case we were discovered. I think we'll find them bunched up, possibly close to an exit point, ready to fight or flee en masse.?</p><p>\"Let's hope so,\" Vanez said. \"It could take ages to locate them all if they've split up. Can you find your way back to the Halls?\" he asked me.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said, \"but I want to come with you.\"</p><p>He shook his head. \"We brought you down to show us the cave. Now that you've done that, there's no place for you here. We can move more quickly without you. Return to the Halls and tell the others what we found. We'll be back when we find the vampaneze.\"</p><p>Seba met me at the gate of entry and escorted me up to the Hall of Princes. Many Generals had filed in to discuss the emergency, but apart from those with special permission to run errands, none had been allowed to leave the cave around the Hall, so a lot stood or sat outside, waiting for news to trickle through.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley and Harkat were inside. The vampire was talking with the Princes. Harkat was standing to one side with Madam Octa's cage. He presented it to me when I joined him. \"I thought... you'd be glad... to see her,\" he said.</p><p>I wasn't really, but I pretended I was. \"Great, Harkat.\" I smiled. \"Thanks for thinking of it. I missed her.\"</p><p>\"Harkat has been taking good care of your spider,\" Seba said. \"He offered to give her to me when you disappeared, but I told him to hang on to her. I said one never knew what lay around the corner - I had a feeling you might be back.\"</p><p>\"You may wind up with her yet,\" I said gloomily. \"I seem to have won back my honor, but there's still my failure in the Trials to deal with.\"</p><p>\"Surely they won't... punish you for... that now?\" Harkat said.</p><p>I glanced at Seba's face - it was stern, and he said nothing.</p><p>Vanez Blane returned a couple of hours later with good news - they'd discovered the location of the vampaneze. \"They're in a long, narrow cave, close to the exterior of the mountain,\" Vanez explained to the Princes, wasting no time on rituals or pleasantries. \"There's one way in and one way out. The exit tunnel runs straight to the outside, so they can make a quick getaway if they have to.\"</p><p>\"We'll position men outside to catch them if they do,\" Mika said.</p><p>\"That will be difficult,\" Vanez sighed. \"The ground is steep where the tunnel opens out, and I'm sure they'll have sentries posted. I doubt that we'll be able to sneak men up there. It will be better to take them inside if we can.\"</p><p>\"You think we cannot?\" Paris asked sharply, alerted by Vanez's worried tone.</p><p>\"It won't be easy, however we go about it,\" Vanez said. \"No matter how delicately we mask our approach, we won't be able to surprise them. Once they become aware of us closing in, they'll throw up a rear phalanx to delay us while the majority escape.\"</p><p>\"What if we block the tunnel from the outside?\" Arrow asked. \"Create an avalanche or something. Then they'd have to stand and fight.\"</p><p>\"That's a possibility,\" Vanez agreed, \"but blocking the tunnel may prove awkward. Besides, that would alert them to our presence and intentions, and they'd have time to prepare for us. I'd rather spring a trap.\"</p><p>\"You think they might beat us in a fair fight?\" Arrow snorted.</p><p>Vanez shook his head. \"No. We couldn't get close enough to make a full count, but I don't think there's more than forty vampaneze down there, probably less. I've no doubt that we'll beat them.\" The vampires cheered Vanez's claim. \"It's not the winning that bothers me,\" he shouted over their excited clamors. \"It's the losses we'll incur.\"</p>","<p>\"Damn the losses!\" Arrow growled. \"We've spilled blood before, dispatching vampaneze - who here will hesitate to spill it again?\" By the roars it was plain that nobody would.</p><p>\"That's easy to say,\" Vanez sighed when the cheers had died down. \"But if we charge in and take them on without some sort of a distraction, we're looking at the possible loss of thirty or forty vampires, maybe more. The vampaneze have nothing to lose and will fight to the bitter, bloody end. Do you want to take responsibility for those casualties, Arrow?\"</p><p>Much of the vampires' joy abated at Vanez's words. Even the eager, vampaneze-hating Arrow looked hesitant. \"You think we'll lose that many?\" he asked quietly.</p><p>\"We'd be lucky to just lose thirty or forty,\" Vanez replied bluntly. \"They've picked their position expertly. We won't be able to rush or overwhelm them. We'll have to advance a handful at a time, taking them on one-to-one. Our superior numbers will lead to eventual victory, but it won't be quick or easy. They'll hurt us - badly.?</p><p>The Vampire Princes shared an uncomfortable look. \"Those sorts of figures are unacceptable,\" Paris stated bleakly.</p><p>\"They are a bit on the high side,\" Mika reluctantly agreed.</p><p>\"Is it possible to create a diversion?\" Mr. Crepsley asked, joining in the discussion. \"Could we flood or smoke them out?\"</p><p>\"I've thought of that,\" Vanez said. \"I don't see any way of pumping enough water down there to trouble them. Fire would be ideal, but the cave's well ventilated. The ceiling's high and full of tiny cracks and holes. We'd have to get inside the cave and light a huge bonfire to create enough smoke to bother them.\"</p><p>\"Then it will have to be a full-frontal attack,\" Paris declared. \"We will send in our best spearists first, who should eliminate many of them before we go hand-to-hand. Our losses should not be as great that way.\"</p><p>\"They'll still be substantial,\" Vanez objected. \"Spearists won't have much room to operate. They might take out the guards by the entrance, but after that...\"</p><p>\"What option do we have?\" Arrow snapped. \"Would you rather we went down with a white flag and discussed peace terms?\"</p><p>\"Don't bellow at me in that tone!\" Vanez shouted.</p><p>\"I'm as anxious to get at them as any vampire here. But it will be a Pyrrhic victory if we fight one-to-one.\"</p><p>Paris sighed. \"If that is the only victory we can hope for, we must accept it.\"</p><p>In the short silence that followed, I asked Seba what a Pyrrhic victory was. \"That is when the price of winning is too high,\" he whispered. \"If we defeat the vampaneze, but lose sixty or seventy of our own troops doing so, it will be a worthless victory. The first rule of warfare is never to weaken yourself irreparably while destroying your enemies.\"</p><p>\"There is one alternative,\" Paris said hesitantly. \"We could run them off. If we made a lot of noise approaching, I am sure they would scatter rather than face us. The vampaneze are not cowards, but they aren't fools either. They will not stand and fight a battle they are sure to lose.\"</p><p>Angry mutters greeted this suggestion. Most vampires believed that would be dishonorable. They agreed that they'd rather confront the vampaneze.</p><p>\"It is not the most honorable of tactics,\" Paris shouted over the heated whispers, \"but we could pursue and fight them on the outside. Many would escape, but we would capture and kill enough of them to teach them a harsh lesson.\"</p><p>\"Paris has a point,\" Mika said, and the muttering stopped. \"I don't like it, but if it's a choice between letting most go or sacrificing forty or fifty of our own...?</p><p>Heads began nodding, slowly, unhappily. Paris asked Arrow what he thought of the suggestion. \"I think it stinks,\" he snarled. \"The vampaneze aren't bound by our laws - they can flit once outside. We'd catch virtually none of them.\" Flitting was the superquick speed vampires and vampaneze could run at. By tradition, vampires were not allowed to flit on the way to and from Vampire Mountain.</p><p>\"Were I a General,\" Arrow went on, \"I'd object most vehemently to letting them go. I'd rather fight and die than concede ground to the enemy in such a meek fashion.\" He sighed miserably. \"But, as a Prince, I must put the welfare of our people before the stirrings of my heart. Unless somebody can think of a plan to distract the vampaneze and clear the way for an attack, I will agree to running them off.\"</p><p>When nobody spoke up, the Princes called their leading Generals forward and discussed the best way to drive off the vampaneze and where they should place their men on the outside. An air of disappointment hung heavily over the Hall, and most vampires stood or sat with their heads bowed, disgusted.</p><p>\"They don't like this,\" I whispered to Seba.</p><p>\"Nor do I,\" he replied, \"but pride must be checked in the face of such aggressive odds. We could not allow our men to perish in horrifying numbers, all for the sake of honor. Reason must be obeyed, no matter how galling it might be.\"</p><p>I was as upset as the rest of the vampires. I wanted revenge for Gavner Purl. There was no satisfaction in letting the vampaneze wriggle off the hook. I'd spoiled their plans to invade the Hall of Princes, but that wasn't enough I could imagine the smirk on Kurda's face when he learned of our diplomatic decision.</p><p>As I stood, pouting, a tiny insect flew into Madam Octa's cage and got trapped in a small web she'd spun in a corner. The spider reacted quickly and advanced on the struggling captive, disposing of it. I watched, mildly interested, then stiffened as a crazy thought struck me.</p><p>Gazing at the feeding spider, I let my brain whirl wildly, and the plan formed within a matter of seconds. It was simple yet effective - the very best sort.</p><p>Standing on my tiptoes, I cleared my throat three times before I managed to attract Mr. Crepsley's attention. \"Yes, Darren?\" he asked wearily.</p><p>\"Excuse me,\" I called, \"but I think I know how to distract the vampaneze.\"</p><p>All conversation ceased, and every pair of eyes settled on me. I stepped forward unbidden and spoke nervously. As I outlined my proposals, the vampires started to smile. By the time I finished, most were laughing outright at the wicked, cunning scheme.</p><p>Voting was brief and unanimous. My plan was put to the vampires, and, as one, they roared their approval. Without any further ado, the Princes and Generals fell to organizing their attack forces, while Seba, Mr. Crepsley, and I slipped away to gather together our own army of troops and prepare for the first stage of what, in a war film, would probably have been called Operation Arachnid!</p><p>Chapter FIFTEEN</p><p>OUR First stop wasthe cave of Ba'Halen's spiders, where Seba had taken me when I was suffering after my Trial on the Path of Needles. The quartermaster went in by himself, carrying Madam Octa in the palm of his left hand. He was grim-looking and empty-handed when he emerged, eyes half-closed. \"Did it work?\" I asked. \"Were you able -\" He shushed me with a quick wave of a hand. Closing his eyes completely, he concentrated fiercely. Moments later, Madam Octa crept out of the cave, followed by a spider with light grey spots on its back. I recognized that spider - I'd seen it mooning after Madam Octa before.</p><p>Behind the grey-spotted spider came several more of the mildly poisonous mountain spiders. Others followed, and soon a thick stream of spiders was flowing out of the cave and gathering around us. Seba was directing them, communicating mentally with the wild eight-legged predators.</p><p>\"I am going to transfer control now,\" he told Mr. Crepsley and me when all the spiders were in place. \"Larten, take the spiders to my right. Darren, those to my left.\"</p><p>We nodded and faced the spiders. Mr. Crepsley was able to communicate without the use of aids, as Seba was, but I needed my familiar flute to focus my thoughts and transmit them. Raising it to my lips, I blew a few practice notes. It was awkward, because of my bent right thumb - which still hadn't straightened out - but I quickly learned to compensate for the damaged digit. Then I stood awaiting Seba's word.</p><p>\"Now,\" he said softly.</p><p>Gently, I played and sent a repeated mental message to the spiders. \"Stay where you are,\" I told them. \"Hold, my beauties, hold.\"</p><p>The body of spiders swayed uncertainly when Seba stopped transmitting his thoughts, before fixing on mine and Mr. Crepsley's. After a few confused seconds they clicked into sync with our brainwaves.</p><p>\"Excellent.\" Seba beamed, stepping forward, careful not to squash any of the spiders. \"I will leave you with them and go find others. Escort these to the meeting point and wait for me. If any start to drift away, send Madam Octa to rally them - they will obey her.\"</p><p>We let Seba exit, then turned toward each other. \"You need not play the flute continuously,\" Mr. Crepsley advised. \"A few whistles and commands once we get moving should be enough. They will fall into place behind us and advance naturally. Save the flute for stragglers or rebels.\"</p><p>\"Should we lead or take the rear?\" I asked, lowering my flute to wet my lips.</p><p>\"Lead,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"But keep an eye on them and be prepared to drop back if need be, ideally without interrupting the march of the others.\"</p><p>\"I'll try,\" I said, then faced forward and played.</p><p>Off I went, Mr. Crepsley beside me, the spiders scuttling along behind. When we reached the larger tunnels, we moved farther apart to form two separate lines.</p><p>It wasn't as difficult to command the spiders as I'd feared. A few gave me problems - they fought with others or tried to edge away - but a quick intervention on the part of Madam Octa was enough to knock them back into shape. She was enjoying her role and even started patrolling the ranks of her own accord, without prompting. She'd have made a great General if she'd been a vampire!</p><p>Finally, we pulled into the large cave we'd established as our base. We arranged the spiders around us in a circle, then sat in the middle of them and waited for Seba.</p><p>He was leading an army of spiders almost half again as large as ours when he arrived. \"Where'd you get them all?\" I asked as they encircled those already in the cave.</p><p>\"The mountain is full of spiders,\" he said. \"One simply needs to know where to look.\" He sat beside us and smiled. \"Having said that, I have never in my life seen such a concentration in one place at one time. It is enough to unnerve even a hardened handler such as myself!\"</p><p>\"I feel that way too,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed, then laughed. \"If they have such an effect on us, what sort of terror will they provoke in the unsuspecting vampaneze?\"</p><p>\"That is what we shall shortly discover,\" Seba chuckled.</p><p>While we waited to be contacted by the Princes, Mr. Crepsley took my flute from me and fiddled with it. When he handed it back, it no longer worked and thus couldn't alert the vampaneze. The fact that it had been muted didn't matter - the music itself made no difference to the spiders. I only used the flute out of habit, after years of performing with Madam Octa at the Cirque Du Freak.</p><p>After a long, uncomfortable wait, we spotted a platoon of vampires slipping by. Arrow soon appeared and advanced to the edge of the eight-legged sea. He gazed uneasily around at the spiders and came no closer. He was gripping two heavy, sharp-tipped boomerangs and had three more strapped to his waist. The boomerang was his weapon of choice. \"We're ready,\" he whispered. \"The vampaneze haven't left their cave. Our troops are in position. The sun shines brightly outside. It is time.\"</p><p>We nodded obediently and got to our feet.</p><p>\"You know what to do?\" Mr. Crepsley asked me.</p><p>\"I take my spiders out,\" I responded. \"I get close to the mouth of the tunnel, taking care not to be seen. You and Seba will guide your spiders forward, using the tiny cracks and holes in the walls and roof of the cave. You'll hold them there until I make the first move. I'll send my spiders against the guards in the tunnel opening. When you hear the commotion, you'll order yours in - then the fun begins!\"</p><p>\"Allow us a decent amount of time to position our spiders,\" Seba instructed me. \"They will be difficult to maneuver, since we cannot see where they are going. It will be a slow, painstaking process.\"</p><p>\"I'm in no hurry,\" I said. \"Will three hours be enough?\"</p><p>\"That should be plenty,\" Seba said, and Mr. Crepsley agreed.</p><p>We wished each other luck and shook hands, then I summoned my troops - the smallest of the three clusters of spiders, since they'd have the least to do - and set off for the outside.</p><p>The sun shone weakly in a mostly cloudless sky, which was helpful - the vampaneze guards would keep far away from the mouth of the tunnel to avoid the deadly rays of light.</p><p>I emerged about forty yards up from the tunnel. I held my position until all my spiders were out in the open around me, then urged them forward, slowly and carefully. We crept down the mountain until we were ten yards shy of the tunnel, sheltered by a large rock that jutted out of the mountain face, providing perfect cover. This was as close to the tunnel as I dared to get.</p><p>Once in place, I lay down and watched the sun cross the sky. I'd been chosen for the external leg of the operation partly because it provided fewer problems than the pair working within the mountain would have to deal with, but also because I was immune to the sun. It was vital that we attack by day - the vampaneze would be reluctant to leave their sanctuary and face the sun - but the vampires would have been restrained by the solar giant as much as their foes. Only I could move about outside as freely as I pleased.</p><p>When slightly more than three hours had passed, I blew mutely on my flute and ordered the spiders to spread out wide, before advancing. Only the spiders moved forward - I stayed where I was, hidden by the rock. The spiders formed a ring around the mouth of the tunnel. From the outside they looked harmless, but when they entered the cave, they'd assume a different dimension - they'd look more numerous and a lot more threatening. Cramped spaces have a way of magnifying one's fears. The vampaneze would hopefully feel they were under siege and panic accordingly.</p>","<p>A couple of minutes later the ranks were orderly. Then I gave the signal to enter. They slipped in silently, covering not just the floor of the tunnel, but also the walls and the roof. If everything went as planned, the vampaneze would think the tunnel was coming alive with spiders.</p><p>I was supposed to stay where I was, out of the way, but the temptation to sneak forward and observe the unfolding of my plan proved too great to resist. Lying flat on the rough face of the mountain, I slid down to the top of the tunnel and listened for the sounds of chaos within.</p><p>I could hear the heavy breathing of vampaneze, farther back from the entrance than I'd expected. For a while, that was all I could hear, calm and regular. I was starting to wonder if maybe the spiders had slipped through cracks and deserted back to their natural habitat. Then one of the vampaneze grunted, \"Hey! Is it my imagination, or are the walls moving?\"</p><p>His colleagues laughed. \"Don't be stu -,\" one began, then stopped. \"What in the name of the gods...?\" I heard him gasp.</p><p>\"What's happening?\" somebody shouted, alarmed. \"What are they?\"</p><p>\"They look like spiders,\" one of his less-agitated comrades answered.</p><p>\"There's millions of them!\" a vampaneze whimpered.</p><p>\"Are they poisonous?\" another asked.</p><p>\"Of course not,\" the unafraid vampaneze snorted. \"They're just ordinary mountain spiders. They can't do any -?</p><p>Blowing hard on my flute, I sent the order to the spiders: \"Now!\"</p><p>Inside the tunnel, screams erupted.</p><p>\"They're dropping!\" someone howled.</p><p>\"They're all over me! Get them off! Get them off! Get them -?</p><p>\"Calm down!\" the levelheaded vampaneze yelled. \"Just brush them off and - ahhhhh!\" he screamed as the spiders seized hold and sank their fangs in.</p><p>Individually, the spiders were harmless - their bites were only mildly irritating. But the simultaneous bites of hundreds of them... that was a different matter entirely!</p><p>As the vampaneze thrashed around the tunnel, slapping and stamping at the spiders, screaming with pain and fear, I heard others advance from within the cave to see what was wrong. Darting into the tunnel, I crouched down low and ordered the spiders to surge ahead. As they obeyed, panicking the newcomers and forcing them backward, the cave behind echoed with the screams and writhing of the vampaneze, as Mr. Crepsley and Seba's spiders slipped from the walls and roof and worked their fearsome charms.</p><p>The battle had truly begun.</p><p>Chapter SIXTEEN</p><p>Iwasn't supposed to join in the fighting, but the uproar of the terrified vampaneze excited me, and before I knew what I was doing, I'd sneaked forward to observe what was happening within the cave.</p><p>It was incredible to watch. Spiders covered the floor and walls and - most vitally - the rioting vampaneze. The purple-faced wretches were leaping around like cartoon figures, yelling and screeching, desperately trying to repel the attack. Some used swords and spears, which were no use against the tiny invaders, who easily ducked the wild blows and darted forward to sink their fangs into exposed patches of flesh. The vampaneze with the swords and spears were doing almost as much damage as the spiders. Lashing out blindly, they connected with their colleagues, wounding several, even killing a few.</p><p>Some of the wiser vampaneze were struggling to establish control, roaring at the others to form ranks against the spiders. But the pandemonium dwarfed their efforts. They were ignored, sometimes knocked out of the way when they tried to intervene.</p><p>In the midst of the panic, Streak and the two younger wolves bounded into the cave from the far entrance, yapping, howling, and snarling as loudly as possible. I don't think anybody had invited the wolves along - they simply came of their own accord, eager to be part of the victory!</p><p>When the vampaneze saw the wolves coming, several turned and bolted for the exit. They'd had enough - even the lethal sunlight seemed welcome in comparison to this! I thought about standing aside and letting them pass, but the battle lust was strong in me, and adrenaline was pumping through every cell of my body. I wanted to keep them here if I could so they would suffer along with the rest of their despicable tribe. At the time, revenge was all I could focus on. It was all that seemed to matter.</p><p>Looking around, I spotted a spear that one of the tunnel guards had dropped during the course of their hasty retreat. Picking it up, I wedged the end against a crack in the floor, then pointed the tip at the charging vampaneze. The lead vampaneze saw me and tried to veer out of the way of the spear, but those behind pushed him on unwittingly. Running right into the spear, he impaled himself without any help from me.</p><p>Standing, I roughly shoved the vampaneze off the spear, then bellowed at those behind him. They must have thought the way was blocked by a horde of savage vampires, because they immediately turned and retreated. I laughed triumphantly and started after them, meaning to add a few more scalps to my collection. Then I happened to glance at the vampaneze who'd run onto my spear, and I came to a sickened halt.</p><p>He was young, his face only a light shade of purple. He was crying and making soft whimpering noises. Unable to stop myself, I crouched beside him. \"It... hurts!\" he gasped, clutching at the deep, wide hole in his belly. His hands were red, and I knew his cause was hopeless.</p><p>\"It's OK,\" I lied. \"It's only a flesh wound. You'll be up on your -\" Before I could say more, he coughed. Blood pumped out of his mouth, a huge torrent of it. His eyes widened, then closed. He groaned softly, fell back, shuddered, then died.</p><p>I'd killed him.</p><p>The thought shook me to my very core. I'd never killed before. Even though I'd been looking forward to punishing the vampaneze for what they did to Gavner, it was only now that I considered the consequences of my actions. This vampaneze - this person - was dead. I had taken his life and could never restore it.</p><p>Maybe he deserved death. He might have been rotten to the core and in need of killing. Then again, maybe he'd been an ordinary guy, like me or any of the vampires, only here because he'd been following orders. Either way, deserving or not, who was I to decide? I didn't have the right to pass judgment on others and kill them. Yet I'd done it. Excited by the fear of the vampaneze, intent on revenge, letting my heart rule my head, I'd raised a weapon against this man and killed him.</p><p>I hated myself for what I'd done. I wanted to turn and run, get far away and pretend this never happened. I felt cheap, dirty, nasty. I tried consoling myself with the thought that I'd done the right thing, but how did one separate right from wrong where killing was concerned? I'm sure Kurda thought he was doing right when he stabbed Gavner. The vampaneze thought they were doing right when they drained people they fed upon. However I looked at it, I had the awful feeling that I was now no better than any other killer, one of a vicious, terrible, inhuman breed.</p><p>Only my sense of duty held me in place. I knew that vampires would be attacking at any moment. It was my job to keep the spiders active until they did, so that the vampaneze couldn't regroup and meet the assault head-on. If I deserted my post, vampires would perish in great numbers along with the vampaneze. I had to concentrate on the bigger picture, regardless of how I felt inside.</p><p>Sticking my flute back between my lips, I played and urged the spiders to swarm over the vampaneze. The scene looked so different in light of the life I'd taken. I no longer enjoyed watching the vampaneze shriek and lash out blindly, or saw them as evil villains on the receiving end of their just deserts. Instead I saw warriors, terrified and humiliated, stranded far from their homes and allies, about to be ruthlessly slaughtered.</p><p>At the height of the hysteria, the vampires attacked, led by a bellowing Arrow, who tossed his sharp-edged boomerangs at the vampaneze, one after the other, drawing blood with each. Spearists were beside and behind him, and their hurled weapons caused much damage and claimed many lives.</p><p>As vampires poured into the cave, the spiders withdrew, urged to retreat by the unseen Mr. Crepsley and Seba. I held my spiders in place awhile longer, keeping the panic alive at this end of the cave.</p><p>In less than a minute, the vampires had stormed the whole cave, those with swords and knives replacing the first wave of spearists. They hadn't come in great numbers - if too many had poured into the narrow chamber, they'd have been in each other's way - but the thirty who'd entered seemed to be far more in comparison with the stricken vampaneze. It seemed as though there were five vampires to every one of their foes.</p><p>Arrow was in the thick of the action, leading by example, as mercilessly efficient with his swords as he'd been with his boomerangs. Vanez Blane stood close by the Prince, knives flashing, backing him up. Alarmed as they were by the spiders and wolves, the vampaneze quickly realized where the real threat was, and they hurriedly backed away from the coldly murderous pair.</p><p>Arra Sails was also part of the first assault. She was in her element, attacking the vampaneze with a short sword in one hand, a spiked chain in the other, laughing brutally as they fell beneath her. I'd have cheered her display a few minutes earlier, but now I felt only dismay at the joy she and the other vampires were taking in the destruction.</p><p>\"This isn't right,\" I muttered to myself. Killing the vampaneze was one thing - it had to be done - but relishing their downfall was wrong. There was something deeply unsettling about seeing the vampires find so much ghoulish satisfaction in the massacre.</p><p>Confused as I was, I decided I'd better wade in and help. The sooner we finished off the vampaneze, the sooner I could turn my back on the horror. Taking a sharp dagger from the man I'd killed, I called off my spiders, then threw my flute away and stepped forward to join the press of battling vampires and vampaneze.</p><p>I kept to the edges of the fighting, jabbing at the feet or legs of vampaneze, distracting them, making it easier for the vampires they were facing to disarm and kill them. I took no pleasure from my success, only continued, determined to help bring things to a quick conclusion.</p><p>I saw Mr. Crepsley and Seba Nile entering the cave, their red robes billowing behind them, eager to be part of the bloodshed. I didn't hold their eagerness to kill against them. I didn't hold it against any of the vampires. I just thought it was misplaced and unseemly.</p><p>The fighting intensified shortly after Mr. Crepsley and Seba joined the fray. Only the toughest and most composed of the vampaneze had survived the first period of madness, and now they battled grimly to the finish, making their stands, some alone, some in pairs, taking as many vampires to the grave with them as they could.</p><p>I saw the first vampire casualties slump to the ground, bellies sliced open or heads bashed in, bleeding and sobbing, crying out loud with pain. On the floor, dying, covered in blood, they looked no different from the vampaneze.</p><p>As the front-runners of the second vampire wave trickled into the cave, Vanez slapped Arrow's back and told him to leave. \"Leave?\" the Prince snorted. \"It's just getting interesting!\"</p><p>\"You've got to go,\" Vanez roared, dragging Arrow away from the fighting. \"It's Mika's turn to bloody his blade. Go back to the Hall of Princes and relieve Paris, as you promised. You've had your fair share of the killing. Don't be greedy.\"</p><p>Arrow left reluctantly. On his way, he passed Mika, and the two clapped each other on the back, as though one was a substitute replacing the other in a game of football.</p><p>\"Not pleasant, is it?\" Vanez grunted, pulling up beside me. He was sweating freely and paused to dry his hands on his tunic as the fighting raged around us.</p><p>\"It's horrible,\" I muttered, gripping my knife before me like a cross.</p><p>\"You shouldn't be here,\" Vanez said. \"Larten wouldn't approve if he knew.\"</p><p>\"I'm not doing it for fun,\" I told him.</p><p>Looking deep into my eyes, Vanez sighed. \"So I see. You learn quickly, Darren.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I asked.</p><p>He gestured at the warring, whooping vampires. \"They think this is a great sport.\" He laughed bleakly. \"They forget that the vampaneze were once our brothers, that by destroying them, we destroy a part of ourselves. Most vampires never realize how pointless and savage war truly is. You were smart enough to see the truth. Don't ever forget it.\"</p><p>A dying vampaneze stumbled toward us. His eyes had been cut out, and he was moaning pitifully. Vanez caught him, lowered him to the floor, and finished him off quickly and mercifully. When he stood, his face was grim. \"But, painful as war is,\" he said, \"sometimes it can't be avoided. We didn't seek this confrontation. Remember that later, and don't hold our aggression against us. We were forced into this.\"</p><p>\"I know,\" I sighed. \"I just wish there'd been some other way to punish the vampaneze, short of tearing them to pieces.\"</p><p>\"You should leave,\" Vanez suggested. \"This is where the truly dirty work begins. Return to the Halls and drink yourself senseless.\"</p><p>\"I might do that,\" I agreed and turned away, leaving Vanez and the others to round up the final stubborn vampaneze. As I was departing, I spotted a familiar face among the crowd - a vampaneze with a dark red birthmark on his left cheek. It took me a moment to recall his name - Glalda, the one who'd spoken with Kurda in the tunnel when Gavner was killed. He'd wanted to kill me as well as Gavner. Hatred flared in my chest, and I had to resist the urge to dart back into the action.</p><p>Edging clear of the fighting, I would have slipped away, but a crowd of vampires was blocking my path. They'd surrounded a wounded vampaneze and were taunting him before they closed in for the kill. Disgusted by their antics, I looked for another way out. As I was doing that, Arra Sails stepped forward to meet the challenge of the vampaneze named Glalda. Two vampires lay dead at his feet, but Arra pushed on regardless.</p>","<p>\"Prepare to die, worm!\" she yelled, flicking at him with her chain.</p><p>Glalda brushed aside the length of chain and laughed. \"So the vampires send women to do their fighting now!\" he sneered.</p><p>\"Women are all the vampaneze are fit to face,\" Arra retorted. \"You are not worthy of facing men and dying with honor. Imagine the disgrace when word spreads that you perished at the hands of a woman!\"</p><p>\"That would be a disgrace,\" Glalda agreed, lunging with his sword. \"But it won't happen!\"</p><p>The two ceased trading words and started trading blows. I was surprised they'd exchanged as much banter as they had - most of the combatants were too concerned with the business of trying to stay alive to stand around like movie stars and trade verbal insults. Arra and the vampaneze circled each other warily, lashing out with their weapons, probing for weak points. Glalda might have been surprised to come face-to-face with a woman, but he treated her with wary respect. Arra, for her part, was more reckless. She'd mown down several of the panic-stricken vampaneze early in the encounter and had come to believe that all would fall as easily as her initial victims had. She left clumsy defensive gaps and took perilous, needless risks.</p><p>I wanted to escape the confines of the cave and put the fighting behind me, but I couldn't bring myself to leave until I'd seen Arra's encounter through to the end. She'd been a good friend and had come looking for me when I disappeared. I didn't want to slip away until I knew she was safe.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley also stopped to observe Arra's battle. He was quite a distance away, separated from her by a pack of scuffling vampires and vampaneze. \"Arra!\" he yelled. \"Do you need help?\"</p><p>\"Not I!\" she laughed, driving her chain at the face of the vampaneze. \"I'll finish this fool off before you can say -?</p><p>Whatever boast she was about to make was cut short. Ducking out of the way of her chain, Glalda brushed her defensive stroke aside, drove the tip of his sword deep into her belly, and twisted cruelly. Arra cried out with anguish and fell.</p><p>\"Now, woman\" the vampaneze sneered, straddling her and raising his sword. \"Watch closely - I'll show you how we dispose of your kind!\" Aiming the tip of his sword at her eyes, he brought it down slowly. Arra could do nothing but stare up at him hatefully and wait to die.</p><p>Chapter SEVENTEEN</p><p>Icouldn't stand by and let Glalda kill Arra. Darting forward, I threw myself against the vampaneze and knocked him off-balance. He swore, fell heavily, and turned to deal with me. But I was quicker with my light dagger than he was with his heavy sword. Diving on top of him, I stuck it into his chest and by luck pierced his heart.</p><p>This vampaneze didn't die quietly like the first one I'd killed. He shook and babbled madly, then rolled over, dragging me with him. He tried clambering to his feet. It was hopeless - it must have been clear to him that he was going to die - but he made the effort anyway.</p><p>When his legs gave out, he collapsed on top of me, almost spearing me with the handle of my own dagger. I gasped for breath beneath him as he convulsed and moaned, then managed to heave him off and slide out.</p><p>As I got to my knees, I saw his face relax and the life leave his body. I paused and studied him. His expression was much like Gavner's had been - surprised... annoyed... afraid.</p><p>Gently, I closed the dead warrior's eyelids, then made the death's touch sign by pressing my middle fingers to my forehead and eyes, and spreading my thumb and little finger wide. \"Even in death, may you be triumphant,\" I whispered.</p><p>Then I went to check on Arra. She was in a bad way. She tried getting up, but I held her down and made her press her hands over the wound in her belly to stop the flow of blood.</p><p>\"Will I... die?\" Arra gasped, her lips thin with pain.</p><p>\"Of course not,\" I said, only for her to grab my hands and glare at me.</p><p>\"Will I die?\" she barked.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" I answered honestly this time. \"Maybe.\"</p><p>She sighed and lay back. \"At least I will not die unavenged. You fight well, Darren Shan. You are a true vampire.\"</p><p>\"Thanks,\" I said hollowly.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley reached us and examined Arra worriedly. He rubbed spit around the edges of the cut to stop the bleeding, but his efforts didn't make much of a difference. \"Does it hurt?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Talk about asking... stupid questions!\" she gurgled.</p><p>\"You always said I had a talent for putting my foot in my mouth.\" He smiled, tenderly wiping blood away from the corners of her lips.</p><p>\"I'd ask you to kiss me,\" she said, \"only I'm not... in any shape... for it.\"</p><p>\"There'll be plenty of time for kissing later,\" he vowed.</p><p>\"Maybe,\" Arra sighed. \"Maybe.\"</p><p>While Mr. Crepsley tended to Arra, I sat back and watched numbly as the battle drew to its bloody conclusion. No more than six or seven vampaneze were left on their feet, and each was encircled by several vampires. They should have surrendered, but I knew they wouldn't. Vampires and vampaneze only knew how to win and how to die. For the proud legions of the undead, there was no in-between.</p><p>As I watched, two vampaneze who'd been fighting back-to-back made a break for the exit tunnel. A pack of vampires moved to intercept them, Vanez Blane among them. They prevented the escape, but one of the vampaneze threw his dagger in spiteful desperation before the vampires captured and killed him. It flew through the air like a guided missile at its helpless target - Vanez!</p><p>The games master whipped his head backward and almost avoided the dagger, but it was too swift, and the tip of the blade caught his one good eye. Blood spurted, Vanez screamed and covered his face with his hands, and Seba Nile hurried forward to lead him away to safety.</p><p>By the way he'd screamed, I knew in my gut that if Vanez survived, he would never again see the light of the moon or the twinkle of the stars. The vampaneze had finished the job that a lion had started. Vanez was now completely blind.</p><p>Glancing around miserably, I saw Streak chewing on the head of a still-living vampaneze. One of the younger wolves was helping him. I searched for the other hot-blooded wolf and found it lying dead by a wall, belly ripped open, fangs bared in a vicious death snarl.</p><p>Paris Skyle arrived and took Mika's place. The ancient Prince wielded a thick staff, both ends of which had been sharpened to stakelike points. He showed less taste for the fight than his younger brethren, but still fell in with the bloodshed and latched on to one of the last vampaneze. He made no calls for peace, nor did he tell his men to take these final hardy fighters alive. Perhaps it was best that he didn't. Those vampaneze who'd been taken intact - there were several - had only the Hall of Death to look forward to, where they'd be impaled on stakes in front of a crowd of jeering vampires. Given the choice, I was sure they'd rather die on their feet, with honor.</p><p>Finally, painfully, the fighting drew to a close. The last vampaneze was killed - he roared as he died, \"May the demons take you all!\" - and the clearing away of the bodies began. The vampires acted with mechanical efficiency. Generals who'd been swinging axes and swords moments before now picked up wounded vampires and led them away to be nursed, chuckling as they did so, discussing the battle and making light of the injured party's wounds. Others collected the dead, first the fallen vampires, then the vampaneze. They made mounds of the bodies, which were collected by the ghoulish Guardians of the Blood (they must have been waiting outside the cave during the battle), who carried them away to be readied for cremation.</p><p>It was all done in good spirits. It didn't bother the Generals that we'd lost nine or ten of our own (the actual death toll, by the time those with fatal injuries succumbed, was twelve). The battle had been won, the vampaneze had been destroyed, and the mountain was secure. They thought they'd come out of \"the scrap\" rather well.</p><p>A stretcher had to be brought for Arra - there was no way she could walk. She'd grown quieter while waiting and stared at the roof of the cave as though studying a painting. \"Darren,\" she whispered.</p><p>\"Yes?\"</p><p>\"Do you remember... when I beat you... on the bars?\"</p><p>\"Of course.\" I smiled.</p><p>\"You put up... a good fight.\"</p><p>\"Not good enough,\" I chuckled weakly.</p><p>Coughing, she faced Mr. Crepsley. \"Don't let them kill him, Larten!\" she said. \"I was one of those... who insisted on his... death when he failed... the Trials. But tell them I said he should... be spared. He's a... worthy vampire. He's earned a... reprieve. Tell them!\"</p><p>\"You can tell them yourself,\" Mr. Crepsley said, tears dripping down his cheeks, a display of emotion I never thought I'd see. \"You will recover. I will take you to the Hall of Princes. You can speak up for him.\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\" Arra sighed. \"But if I don't... you'll do it for me? You'll tell them... what I said? You'll protect him?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley nodded wordlessly.</p><p>The stretcher arrived, and Arra was loaded onto it by two vampires. Mr. Crepsley walked along beside her, holding her hand, trying to comfort her. She made a death's touch sign at me with her free hand as she left, then laughed - blood sprayed from her lips - and winked.</p><p>Later that day, shortly before the sun sank in the wintry sky, despite the best efforts of the medics, Arra Sails closed her eyes, made her peace with the gods of the vampires, breathed her last... and died.</p><p>Chapter EIGHTEEN</p><p>Hours later, when wordreached me of Arra's death, I returned to the cave to try to make sense of it all inside my head. The vampires had departed. The dead bodies had been cleared away by the morbid Guardians of the Blood. Even the many trampled spiders had been removed. Only the blood remained, great ugly pools of it, seeping through the cracks in the floor, drying on the walls, dripping from the roof.</p><p>I scratched my cheeks - caked in dust, dried blood, and tears - and studied the random patterns of blood on the floor and walls, thinking back over the fighting and the lives I'd taken. As I listened to the echoes of the dripping blood, I found myself reliving the screams of the vampaneze and vampires, the moans of the dying, Seba leading the blind Vanez away, the relish with which the battle had been fought, Glalda's expression when I killed him, Arra and the way she'd winked at me.</p><p>\"Mind if I join you?\" someone asked.</p><p>Glancing up, I saw it was the aged quartermaster of Vampire Mountain, Seba Nile, limping badly from a wound he'd sustained during the fighting. \"Be my guest,\" I said hollowly, and he sat down beside me.</p><p>For a few minutes we stared around the crimson-splashed cave in silence. Finally, I asked Seba if he'd heard about Arra's death.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he said softly. He laid a hand on my knee. \"You must not mourn too grievously for her, Darren. She died proudly, as she would have wished.\"</p><p>\"She died stupidly!\" I snapped.</p><p>\"You should not say that,\" Seba scolded me gently.</p><p>\"Why not?\" I shouted. \"It's the truth! This was a stupid fight, fought by stupid people.\"</p><p>\"Arra did not think so,\" Seba said. \"She gave her life for this 'stupid fight. Others gave theirs too.\"</p><p>\"That's what makes it stupid,\" I groaned. \"We could have driven them off. We didn't have to come down here and cut them to pieces.\"</p><p>\"If I remember correctly,\" Seba said, \"it was your novel idea regarding the spiders which paved the way for our attack.\"</p><p>\"Thanks for reminding me,\" I said bitterly, lapsing back into silence.</p><p>\"You must not take it to heart,\" Seba said. \"Fighting is our way. It is how we judge ourselves. To the uninitiated this might look like a barbaric bloodbath, but our cause was just. The vampaneze were plotting our downfall. It was us or them. You know that better than anybody - you were there when they killed Gavner Purl.\"</p><p>\"I know,\" I sighed. \"I'm not saying they didn't deserve it. But why were they here? Why did they invade?\"</p><p>Seba shrugged. \"Doubtless we will unearth the truth once we have had a chance to interrogate the survivors.\"</p><p>\"You mean torture,\" I snorted.</p><p>\"If that is what you want to call it,\" he replied bleakly.</p><p>\"OK,\" I said. \"We'll torture them and maybe learn that they attacked just for the hell of it, to knock us out of shape and take over the mountain. Everything will be fine then. We can walk around proudly and slap ourselves on the back.</p><p>\"But what if that wasn't why they attacked?\" I pressed. \"What if there was a different reason?\"</p><p>\"Such as?\" Seba asked.</p><p>\"I don't know. I've no idea how the vampaneze think or why they do what they do. The point is, neither do you or the other vampires. This attack came as a surprise to everyone, didn't it?\"</p><p>\"It was unexpected,\" Seba agreed. \"The vampaneze have never attacked us this aggressively before. Even when they split from us, they cared only about establishing their own society, not undermining ours.\"</p><p>\"So why did they do it?\" I asked again. \"Do you know?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Seba said.</p><p>\"There!\" I exclaimed. \"You don't know, I don't know, the Princes don't know.\" I got to my knees and locked eyes with him. \"Don't you think somebody should have asked? We stormed down here and tore them apart, and not once did any of us stop to question their motives. We reacted like wild animals.\"</p><p>\"There was no time for questions,\" Seba insisted, but I could tell he was troubled by my words.</p><p>\"Maybe there wasn't,\" I said. \"Not now. But what about six months ago? A year? Ten years? A hundred? Kurda was the only one who contacted the vampaneze and tried to understand them. Why didn't others help him? Why weren't attempts made to befriend them, to prevent something like this from ever happening?\"</p>","<p>\"You are commending Kurda Smahlt?\" Seba asked distastefully.</p><p>\"No. Kurda betrayed us. There's no defending what he did. What I'm saying is - if we'd made the effort to get to know the vampaneze, perhaps there would have been no need for him to betray us. Maybe we somehow forced his hand.\"</p><p>\"Your way of thinking puzzles me,\" Seba said. \"You are more human than vampire, I suppose. In time you will learn to see things our way and -?</p><p>\"No!\" I shouted, jumping up. \"I don't want to see things your way. Your way is the wrong way. I admire the strength, honesty, and loyalty of the vampires and want to fit in as one. But not if it means abandoning myself to stupidity, not if it means turning a blind eye to wisdom and common sense, not if it means enduring bloody messes like this just because my leaders are too proud to sit down with the vampaneze and work out their differences.\"</p><p>\"It might have been impossible to work out their differences,\" Seba noted.</p><p>\"But the effort should have been made. The Princes should have tried.?</p><p>Seba shook his head wearily. \"Perhaps you are right. I am old and stuck in the past. I remember when vampires had no choices, when it was kill or be killed, fight or perish. From where I stand, today's battle was savage, but no worse than a hundred others I have witnessed over the course of my centuries.</p><p>\"Having said that, I must admit that the world has changed. Perhaps it is time for us to change too.\" He smiled. \"But who will lead us out of the darkness of the past? Kurda was the face of our future. He, perhaps, could have altered our ways of thinking and living. Now that he has shamed himself, who will dare speak up for the new world and its ways?\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" I said. \"But somebody should. If they don't, nothing will change, and today's disaster will be repeated, over and over, until the vampires wipe the vampaneze out, or vice versa.\"</p><p>\"Heavy thoughts,\" Seba sighed, then stood and massaged his injured left thigh. \"However, I did not come to discuss the future. We have a more immediate and less troubling decision to make.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I asked.</p><p>He pointed to the floor, and I realized that Madam Octa and the spider with light grey spots on his back were squatting behind us. \"Many of our eight-legged friends were crushed in the fighting,\" Seba said. \"These were among the survivors. They could have slipped away with the rest, but they remained, as though awaiting further orders.\"</p><p>\"Do you think that guy's sweet on her?\" I asked, pointing to the grey-spotted spider, momentarily forgetting my darker concerns.</p><p>\"Most certainly.\" Seba grinned. \"I do not think spiders know love as we do. But he remained by her side throughout the fighting and did not leave when she decided to stay. I think they wish to couple.\"</p><p>I smiled at the absurd notion of Madam Octa walking down an aisle in a tiny white dress, Mr. Crepsley waiting at the end to give her away. \"You think I should put him in her cage?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Actually, I was thinking along the lines of freeing her, so that she could make her home with him. I am opposed to the captivity of wild creatures, except where strictly necessary.\"</p><p>\"You want me to let her go?\" I chewed my lower lip and thought it over. \"What if she bites someone?\"</p><p>\"I do not think she will,\" he said. \"With all the mountain tunnels to pick from, it is unlikely that she will choose to set up home where people might intrude.\"</p><p>\"What about offspring? If she breeds, she could give rise to an army of poisonous spiders.\"</p><p>\"I doubt it.\" Seba smiled. \"Even if she could breed with Ba'Halen's spiders, her offspring would probably be no more poisonous than their fathers.\"</p><p>I considered it awhile longer. Seba had suggested letting Madam Octa go before, and I had disagreed. But after all she'd been through, it seemed fitting to release her now. \"OK,\" I said. \"You've convinced me.\"</p><p>\"You do not want to check with Larten?\" Seba asked.</p><p>\"I think he's got bigger things to worry about,\" I said, referring to Arra.</p><p>\"Very well,\" Seba agreed. \"Do you want to tell her the good news, or shall I?\"</p><p>\"I'll do it,\" I said. \"Wait a minute - I'll fetch my flute.\"</p><p>Finding the flute where I'd dropped it, I hurried back, pressed it between my lips, blew soundlessly, and sent the thought to Madam Octa: \"Go. You're free. Leave.\"</p><p>The spider hesitated, then crawled away, the grey-spotted mountain spider in close attendance. Seba and I watched them until they slipped from sight through a crack in the wall. I'd never have fallen in with Mr. Crepsley if not for Madam Octa. She'd played a key part in deciding my ultimate destiny. Though I'd never liked the spider since she bit my best friend, Steve Leopard, now that she'd slid out of my life forever, I felt strangely lonely, as though I'd lost a dear companion.</p><p>Shrugging off my peculiar mood, I laid my flute down - I wouldn't be needing it any longer - and told Seba I'd like to return to the Halls. Side by side, silent as a pair of ghosts, we turned our backs on the scene of the battle and departed, leaving the pools of blood to settle and thicken as they may.</p><p>Chapter NINETEEN</p><p>Upon reaching my cellI fell into my hammock, fully clothed, still stained with the blood of the cave. After sleeping rough for so long, it felt heavenly, and I drifted off to sleep almost immediately. I slept right through the night, and it was early morning when I awoke. The tunnels were quiet outside. Harkat was awake and waiting for me to get up.</p><p>\"I heard... you killed... two vampaneze,\" he said, handing me a bucket of cold water, a towel, and a batch of fresh clothes. I grunted in reply, undressed, and washed off the dried, flaky blood.</p><p>\"The vampires... would not let me... join in. I was glad... in a way. I do not... enjoy the thought... of killing.\"</p><p>\"There's little about it to enjoy,\" I agreed.</p><p>\"Was it... awful?\" he asked.</p><p>\"I don't want to talk about it,\" I said.</p><p>\"Very well. I will not... ask again.\"</p><p>I smiled gratefully, dunked my bald head in the bucket, shook off the water when I came up, scrubbed behind my ears, then asked about Mr. Crepsley. The green light in Harkat's round eyes dimmed slightly. \"He is still... with Arra. He is refusing... to leave her side. Seba is with... him, trying to... comfort him.\"</p><p>\"Do you think I should go and have a word?\"</p><p>Harkat shook his head. \"Not at the... moment. Later, he will... need you. For now, let him... grieve alone.\"</p><p>Drying myself off, I asked about Vanez and the other vampires, but Harkat wasn't able to tell me much. He knew at least ten vampires had died and more were seriously injured, but word of who they were hadn't reached him.</p><p>Once dressed, I accompanied Harkat to the Hall of Khledon Lurt for a quick meal, then we wandered back to our cell and stayed there for the rest of the day. We could have mixed with the vampires in the Hall - they'd cheered loudly when they saw me coming in - but I didn't want to sit listening to them spinning wild tales about the battle and how we'd wiped out the vampaneze.</p><p>Finally, toward dusk, Mr. Crepsley staggered into our cell. His face was paler than usual as he slumped into my hammock, lowered his head into his hands, and groaned. \"You heard the news?\" he whispered.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said. Then, after a brief pause, I added weakly, \"Sorry.\"</p><p>\"I thought she was going to make it,\" he sighed. \"I knew the wound was fatal, but she lasted such a long time, defying the odds, I began to believe she would live.\"</p><p>\"Has she\" - I cleared my throat - \"has she been cremated yet?\"</p><p>He shook his head. \"Nobody has. The Guardians of the Blood are holding the bodies aside for at least two days and nights, as is our custom. The vampaneze, on the other hand...\" He lowered his hands and his expression was genuinely frightening. \"They are being fed to the flames at this very moment. We took them from the Guardians and cut them up into tiny pieces, so their souls cannot escape the pull of the Earth - they will never make it to Paradise. I hope they rot here for all eternity.\"</p><p>I sensed this wasn't the right time to speak of the disgust I'd felt in the cave, or my belief that vampires needed to learn compassion, so I held my tongue and nodded quickly.</p><p>\"What about... Kurda and the... other survivors?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"They will be dealt with later,\" Mr. Crepsley said, eyes narrowing. \"They will be questioned first, then executed. I will be there when they are. Do either of you wish to attend?\"</p><p>\"The questioning, yes,\" I said. \"I'm not so sure about the executions.\"</p><p>\"I will skip... both,\" Harkat said. \"I don't feel... it's my place... to watch. This is a... matter for vampires.\"</p><p>\"As you wish,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"What about the funerals? Do you want to bid farewell to Arra?\"</p><p>\"Of course,\" I answered quietly.</p><p>\"I would like... that,\" Harkat agreed.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley's expression had softened as he mentioned Arra's name. \"She did not say much once she left the cave,\" he whispered, more to himself than to Harkat or me. \"Speaking was painful. She conserved her energy. Fought hard. She clung to life as long as she could.</p><p>\"The medics expected her to die. Every time her breath caught in her throat, they rushed forward, eager to clear the way for other wounded vampires. But she hung on. They got so accustomed to the false alarms that when she did eventually die, they did not realize it, and she lay there twenty minutes, serene in my embrace, smiling blankly at me.\"</p><p>His eyes had filled with tears. I handed him a scrap of cloth as they began to drip, but he didn't use it. \"I couldn't hear her last words,\" he croaked. \"She spoke too softly. I think she was making some kind of reference to her defeat on the bars.\"</p><p>\"Have you had any sleep?\" I asked, beginning to cry too.</p><p>\"How can I sleep?\" he sighed. \"There are the inquisitions to prepare for. I will not miss Kurda's sentencing, not if I have to forsake sleep forever.\"</p><p>\"Don't be silly,\" I gently chided him. \"When does the questioning start?\"</p><p>\"Midnight,\" he said with a sniff.</p><p>\"Then you've plenty of time. Get some sleep. I'll wake you before it starts, and we'll go together.\"</p><p>\"Promise?\" he asked.</p><p>\"I wouldn't lie to you about something this important,\" I replied.</p><p>He nodded, rose, and started for his cell. In the doorway, he paused and looked back. \"You did well in the cave, Darren. You fought bravely. I was proud of you.\"</p><p>\"Thanks,\" I said, choking on my tears, which were flowing freely now.</p><p>\"Proud,\" he muttered again, then faced the corridor and shuffled off to his cell, carrying himself like an old, tired, broken man.</p><p>Later that night, Kurda Smahlt's trial began.</p><p>The Hall of Princes was packed with furious, bitter vampires, as was the cave outside. Virtually every vampire in the mountain wanted to be there to jeer at the traitor, spit at him, and cheer his sentence when it was announced. I'd come with Mr. Crepsley and Seba Nile. We were seated in the front row. We hadn't thought we'd get so close - we arrived late - but I soon discovered that I was the flavor of the moment. The vampires attributed much of their victory over the vampaneze to my efforts. They roared with rough delight when they saw me, then ushered me forward, pushing Mr. Crepsley and Seba along with me, insisting I take pride of place. I'd have rather hung back and viewed the proceedings from afar, but Mr. Crepsley was anxious to get as close to the platform as possible, and I didn't have the heart to disappoint him, not after what he'd been through with Arra.</p><p>The conspirators were going to be brought forward one by one, for separate questioning and sentencing. If they spoke openly, and the Princes were satisfied with their answers, they'd be taken straight to the Hall of Death and executed. If they refused to cooperate, they'd be led away and tortured in the hope that they'd spill their secrets (but vampaneze, like vampires, could deal with enormous amounts of pain and were almost impossible to break).</p><p>The first to face trial was Kurda. The disgraced General was dragged forward in chains, past the ranks of hissing and screaming vampires. Some brushed his guards aside and struck or kicked him. A few pulled at his blond hair and yanked fistfuls of it out by the roots. By the time he reached the platform, he was in a sorry state, his white robes ripped, his body bruised and bleeding. Yet still he held his head high, reacting to none of the abuse.</p><p>The Princes were waiting for him on the platform, flanked by four guards with long, sharp spears. He was placed before the trio, each of whom spat contemptuously on him. Then he was led to one side and turned around to face the assembled vampires. At first I couldn't bring myself to look him in the eye, but when I finally worked up the courage, I found he was staring down at me, smiling sadly.</p><p>\"Order!\" Mika Ver Leth shouted, silencing the booing vampires. \"We have a long night ahead of us. We want to settle each case as quickly and effortlessly as possible. I know feelings are running high, but anyone who interrupts our interrogation of Kurda Smahlt - or the others - will be thrown out immediately. Have I made myself clear?\"</p><p>The vampires muttered sullenly and settled back in their seats. When peace had been restored, Paris Skyle rose and addressed the congregation. \"We know why we are here,\" he spoke softly. \"We have been betrayed and besieged. I am as eager as any to see the vile mongrels suffer for their crimes, but first we must learn why they attacked and if we can expect further assaults.\" Turning to Kurda, his features hardened. \"Were you in league with the vampaneze we killed yesterday?\" he asked.</p>","<p>There was a long pause. Then Kurda nodded and said, \"I was.\"</p><p>Several vampires screamed bloody murder and were swiftly escorted out of the Hall. The others sat white-faced and trembling, glaring hatefully at Kurda.</p><p>\"Upon whose orders were you acting?\" Paris asked.</p><p>\"My own,\" Kurda said.</p><p>\"Liar!\" Arrow barked. \"Tell us who put you up to this, or so help me, I'll -?</p><p>\"I know what you'll do,\" Kurda interrupted. \"Don't worry - I have no wish to be subjected to the rougher questioning of your professional torturers. I will speak the truth here.\"</p><p>\"You'd better,\" Arrow grumbled, sinking back on his throne.</p><p>\"Upon whose orders were you acting?\" Paris asked again.</p><p>\"My own,\" Kurda repeated. \"The plan was mine. The vampaneze were here at my bidding. Torture me all you wish - my answer won't change because it can't change. It's the truth.\"</p><p>\" You dreamt up this outrage?\" Mika asked incredulously.</p><p>\"I did.\" Kurda nodded. \"I arranged for the vampaneze to come. I provided them with copies of my maps, so they could slip in undetected. I -?</p><p>\"Traitor!\" a vampire howled, trying to rush the platform. He was caught by a couple of guards and hauled away, kicking and screaming for all his worth.</p><p>\"I could reach him,\" Mr. Crepsley whispered in the midst of the commotion, his eyes pinned on Kurda. \"I could leap forward now and make an end of him before anyone could stop me.\"</p><p>\"Peace, Larten,\" Seba whispered, laying a soothing hand on the vampire's trembling shoulders. \"Kurda is going nowhere. His death will come soon enough. Let us hear him out.\"</p><p>As soon as the screams of the irate protestor had subsided, Paris resumed the questioning. \"Is it true that you planned to slip the vampaneze into the Hall of Princes once you had been invested, to seize control of the Stone of Blood?\"</p><p>\"It is,\" Kurda answered directly. \"We would have waited for the Ceremony of Conclusion. Then, while you were drinking yourselves stupid, reminiscing about this Council and looking forward to the next, I'd have sneaked them up through secret tunnels, eliminated those who stood on guard, and taken over the Hall.\"</p><p>\"But you could not have held it,\" Paris objected. \"Surely you knew that Mika, Arrow, and I would force open the doors and overwhelm you.\"</p><p>\"That would not have happened,\" Kurda disagreed. \"You wouldn't have been alive to force open the doors. I was going to poison the three of you. I had six bottles of a very rare wine set aside especially for the occasion, each spiked with a particularly lethal concoction. I would have presented them to the three of you in advance of the Ceremony. You'd have toasted my good health, died an hour or two later, and the Hall would have been mine.\"</p><p>\"And then you would have set about getting rid of the rest of our kind,\" Arrow growled.</p><p>\"No,\" Kurda said. \"I would have set about saving them.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" Paris asked, surprised.</p><p>\"Has nobody wondered why I chose such an inopportune moment to instigate an attack?\" Kurda asked, addressing the question to the entire Hall. \"Doesn't it seem strange that I opted to sneak in a horde of vampaneze during Council, while these Halls and tunnels were packed with vampires, when the chance of their being discovered was far greater than if they'd come in a few months' time?\"</p><p>Paris looked confused. \"I assumed you wanted to strike while we were all gathered together,\" he muttered.</p><p>\"Why?\" Kurda challenged him. \"The plan was to sneak into the Hall and seize the Stone of Blood, not to engage the vampire forces. The more vampires in the mountain, the more difficult our task.\"</p><p>\"You wanted to rub it in,\" Arrow snorted. \"You wanted to show off and be able to say you took the Halls in the middle of Council.\"</p><p>\"You think I'm that vain?\" Kurda laughed. \"You think I'd have risked my life just to look stylish? You forget - I'm not like most vampires. I act for the sake of results, not appearances. I'm a cold conspirator, not a hotheaded braggart. I was only interested in success, not showmanship.\"</p><p>\"So why did you attack now?\" Mika asked, exasperated.</p><p>\"Because we'd run out of time,\" Kurda sighed. \"It was now or never. As I said, I meant to save our race, not vanquish it. Our only hope lay in an immediate, preemptive strike. Now that it has failed, I fear we are doomed.\"</p><p>\"What's this nonsense about preemptive strikes?\" Arrow snapped. \"We had no intention of attacking the vampaneze.\"</p><p>\"It was not an attack by the vampires on the vampaneze I sought to halt,\" Kurda explained. \"It was an attack by the vampaneze on the vampires.\"</p><p>\"He talks in riddles!\" Arrow exploded angrily. \"He attacked with the vampaneze to prevent an attack by the vampaneze?\"</p><p>\"Perhaps he's mad,\" Mika murmured seriously. \"Ludicrous,\" Kurda chuckled darkly. \"This is getting us nowhere,\" Arrow growled. \"I say we take him below and drain the truth out of him, drop by bloody drop. He's playing us for fools. We should -?</p><p>\"Mr. Tiny has visited the vampaneze,\" Kurda said, and though he didn't raise his voice, it was as though he'd roared. Arrow and the rest of the vampires lapsed into a sudden, nervous silence and waited for him to continue. \"He came three years ago,\" Kurda said in that same quiet but foreboding tone. \"He told them that the Vampaneze Lord walked the lands and that they should search for him. When word reached me, I dedicated myself to the task of reuniting the vampires with the vampaneze. I hoped that if we bonded before they discovered their mythical leader, we could avoid the terrible consequences of Mr. Tiny's prophecy.\"</p><p>\"I thought you did not believe the myth of the Vampaneze Lord,\" Paris noted.</p><p>\"I didn't,\" Kurda agreed, \"until I saw how seriously the vampaneze were taking it. They'd never been interested in war with us, but since Mr. Tiny's visit, they've been strengthening their arsenals and recruiting vigorously, preparing for their fabled leader's coming.</p><p>\"And now he has come.\" A physical shock ran through the Hall. The vampires recoiled in their seats as though struck, and their faces became ashen. \"Six months ago, the Vampaneze Lord was discovered,\" Kurda said, dropping his gaze. \"He hasn't been blooded, but he's taken his place among them and is learning their ways. My act of treachery was the last desperate roll of the dice. If I'd gained control of the Stone of Blood, I might have been able to win the vampaneze over - not all of our blood-cousins are eager to engage in a war with us. Now that I've failed, the way is open for him. He'll be blooded, take control of the vampaneze, and lead them against us. And he'll win.\"</p><p>Lowering his voice, Kurda muttered bitterly, \"Congratulations, gentlemen. After today's great victory, nothing stands between your good selves and a futile war with the vampaneze. You've cleared the way for Mr. Tiny's prophecy to come to pass.</p><p>\"Enjoy your celebrations. This may be the last chance you get to bang your drums and brag about your valor. As of tonight, the clock is ticking. When it stops, our time is finished. Every vampire in this Hall - in this world - is damned.?</p><p>Smiling bitterly, Kurda snapped loose the chains around his right hand, brought his fingers to his forehead and eyes, and made the death's touch sign at the Princes. Then he looked at me and repeated the gesture. \"Even in death, may you be triumphant,\" he croaked sarcastically as angry, desolate tears glittered in the corners of his sad blue eyes.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY</p><p>The awful hush that followedKurda's proclamation seemed to last an eternity. Finally, Seba Nile rose slowly, pointed a trembling finger at Kurda, and spat, \"You lie!\"</p><p>Kurda shook his head stubbornly. \"I don't.\"</p><p>\"You have seen this Vampaneze Lord?\" Seba asked.</p><p>\"No,\" Kurda said. \"I would have killed him if I had.\"</p><p>\"Then how do you know he exists?\"</p><p>Kurda shrugged in response.</p><p>\"Answer him!\" Paris thundered.</p><p>\"The vampaneze have a unique coffin,\" Kurda said. \"They call it the Coffin of Fire. Mr. Tiny bestowed it upon them many centuries ago, around the same time that he gave us this magical dome in which we stand. Ever since, it has been guarded by a troop of vampaneze who call themselves the Carriers of Destiny.</p><p>\"The coffin is like any other - until someone lies down in it and the lid is put in place. Then the coffin fills with a terrible fire. If the person is destined to lead the vampaneze, he will emerge unscathed. Otherwise, he perishes in the flames.</p><p>\"Over the decades, many vampaneze have braved the Coffin of Fire - and died. But six months ago a human lay down in it, faced the flames, and came out whole. He is the Lord of the Vampaneze, and once he has been blooded, every member of the clan will obey and follow him - to the death, if required.\"</p><p>The Princes stared at Kurda uncertainly, fearfully, until Paris asked in a whisper, \"Were you there when this human was tested?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Kurda replied. \"Only the Carriers of Destiny were present.\"</p><p>\"Then this might be only a rumor,\" Paris said hopefully. \"A tall tale.\"</p><p>\"Vampaneze never lie,\" Kurda reminded him. \"Perhaps they've changed,\" Mika mused. \"The Stone of Blood would be worth a few lies. They could have tricked you, Kurda.\"</p><p>Again Kurda shook his head. \"Many vampaneze are as troubled by the coming of their Lord as we are. They don't seek a war. They fear the losses such a struggle would incur. That's why thirty-eight agreed to accompany me on this mission. They hoped to prevent total, all-out conflict, sparing their colleagues and friends.\"</p><p>\"You keep talking about preventing a war and saving us,\" Paris noted. \"I do not see how you thought betraying our cause could be of any help.\"</p><p>\"I intended to force a union,\" Kurda explained. \"When I heard that the Vampaneze Lord had been unearthed, I knew it was too late to put in place a fair peace agreement. Weighing my options - which were few - I decided to chance a coup. Had I succeeded, vampires everywhere would have been at the mercy of the vampaneze. Those in the Hall of Princes could have communicated with their kin and, via the Stone of Blood, fed them the exact location of most living vampires. Our people would have had no choice but to agree to my terms.\"</p><p>\"And what would they have been?\" Paris asked contemptuously.</p><p>\"That we join the ranks of the vampaneze,\" Kurda answered. \"I'd hoped for an equal union, where vampires and vampaneze each made concessions. Given the change of circumstances, that was impossible. We'd have had to adopt the vampaneze ways and customs. But that would have been preferable to annihilation.\"</p><p>\"Not for me,\" Arrow growled. \"I'd have rather died.\"</p><p>\"I'm sure others would too,\" Kurda agreed. \"But I believe most would have seen sense. Even if they hadn't, and you all chose to fight to the death, at least I'd have tried.\"</p><p>\"What was in it for you, Kurda?\" Mika asked. \"Did the vampaneze promise you a title? Are there to be Princes in the new regime?\"</p><p>\"The vampaneze made no offers,\" Kurda replied shortly. \"Many wish to avoid a war, so a few dozen volunteers - brave men, who you killed like vermin - agreed to risk their lives and assist me. We had no ulterior motives. We did it for your sakes, not our own.\"</p><p>\"Very noble of you, Kurda,\" Mika sneered.</p><p>\"Nobler than you imagine!\" Kurda snapped, losing his cool. \"Have you no brains? Don't you see the sacrifice I made?\"</p><p>\"What sacrifice?\" Mika asked, taken aback.</p><p>\"Win or lose,\" Kurda said, \"my reward would have been death. The vampaneze despise traitors even more than we do. Had everything worked out, I'd have remained within the Hall of Princes to oversee the merging of the clans. Then, when our people's future was assured, I'd have offered myself for sentencing and suffered the very same fate which awaits me now.\"</p><p>\"You expect us to believe the vampaneze would have killed the man who presented their archenemies to them?\" Mika laughed.</p><p>\"You'll believe it because it's true,\" Kurda said. \"Neither the vampires nor vampaneze will suffer a traitor to live. That law is written in the hearts of each and every member of the clans. The vampaneze who came with me would have been heroes - they'd broken none of their own laws, except trespassing on vampire turf - but me, a man who'd betrayed his own?\" Kurda shook his head. \"There was nothing 'in it' for me, Mika, and you're a fool if you believe any different.\"</p><p>Kurda's words disturbed the vampires. I saw them gazing around at one another, ominous questions in their eyes and on their tongues. \"Perhaps he wants us to reward him instead of dropping him on the stakes,\" someone cackled, but no one laughed.</p><p>\"I expect and ask for no mercy,\" Kurda responded. \"My only wish is that you remember what I tried to do in the difficult years to come. I had only the best interests of the clan at heart. I hope one night you see that and acknowledge it.\"</p><p>\"If all you have said is true,\" Paris Skyle commented, \"why did you not come to us? If we had known about the Vampaneze Lord, we could have taken steps to stamp him out.\"</p><p>\"By killing every living vampaneze?\" Kurda asked bitterly.</p><p>\"If we had to.\" Paris nodded.</p><p>\"That was not my wish,\" Kurda sighed. \"I sought to save lives, not take them. Fighting won't save the vampires, not if Mr. Tiny's prophecy is valid. But a union - before the threat could come to pass - might have saved us.</p>","<p>\"I can't say I was right,\" Kurda continued. \"For all I know, my actions will provide the spark which leads to war and destruction. But I had to try. I believed it was in my hands to divert the course of fate. Right or wrong, I couldn't willingly surrender my people to Mr. Tiny's grim prophecy.\"</p><p>Kurda trained his gaze on me. \"I have few regrets,\" he said. \"I took a chance, and it didn't pan out - that's life. My one real source of sorrow is that I had to kill Gavner Purl. It was not my wish to shed blood. But the plan came first. The future of our people as a whole outweighed that of any individual. I'd have killed a dozen more like Gavner if I had to - even a hundred, if it meant safeguarding the lives of the rest.\"</p><p>With that, Kurda drew his case to a close and refused to say any more about his betrayal. The Princes asked him if he knew where the Vampaneze Lord was, or what the vampaneze were planning, but in answer he just shook his head.</p><p>The Princes opened the questioning to the floor, but none of the vampires accepted the invitation to address the fallen General. They looked downcast and ashamed of themselves now. None of them liked Kurda or approved of what he'd done, but they had come to respect him and regretted the way they'd treated him earlier.</p><p>When a suitable period of silence had elapsed, Paris nodded at the guards on the platform to position Kurda before the Princes. When he was standing in front of them, Paris reflected inwardly for a few minutes, gathering his thoughts. When ready, he spoke. \"I am troubled by what you have said. I would rather you had been a nefarious traitor, out for profit and personal gain. That way I could sentence you to death with a clear conscience and no hesitation.</p><p>\"I believe you acted in good faith. It may even be as you say, that by thwarting your plans, we have condemned ourselves to defeat at the hands of the vampaneze. Maybe it would have been for the best if Darren had not chanced upon your colleagues in the cave, or survived to carry news of them back.</p><p>\"But you were discovered, you were revealed, and the vampaneze were dispatched by all bloody means possible. There is no way to change these things, even if we wished to. The future may be bleak, but we shall face it on our feet, as vampires, with firm hearts and wills, as is our way.</p><p>\"I have sympathy for you, Kurda,\" he continued. \"You acted as you thought you must, without consideration for yourself, and for that you are to be commended. However, you also acted without consideration for our laws and ways, and for that you must be punished. There is only one fitting punishment for the crime you have committed, and it is absolute - execution.?</p><p>A heavy collective sigh swept through the Hall. \"Had I a choice,\" Paris went on, \"I would grant you the right to die on your feet, as a vampire, with pride. You do not deserve to die ignominiously, bound and blindfolded, impaled on stakes from behind. I would let you embark on a series of harsh tests, one after the other, until you perished honorably. And I would drink a toast to your name as you were being cremated whole.</p><p>\"But, as a Prince, I have no choice. Whatever your reasons, you betrayed us, and that harsh fact of life overrules my own wishes.\" Rising, Paris pointed at Kurda and said, \"I vote that he be taken to the Hall of Death and summarily executed. After that, he should be dismembered before cremation, so that his soul may never know Paradise.\"</p><p>After a brief pause, Mika Ver Leth stood and pointed as Paris was pointing. \"I don't know if it's just or not,\" he sighed, \"but we must obey the customs that guide and maintain us. I too vote for the Hall of Death and shameful cremation.\"</p><p>Arrow stood and pointed. \"The Hall of Death,\" he said simply.</p><p>\"Does anyone care to speak on behalf of the traitor?\" Paris asked. There was complete silence. \"We may be persuaded to reconsider our judgment if there is opposition,\" he said. Still no one spoke.</p><p>I stared at the pitiful figure in front of me and thought of how he'd made me feel at home when I arrived at Vampire Mountain, how he'd treated me like a friend, joked with me, and shared his knowledge and years of experience. I remembered when he knocked Arra Sails off the bars, and how he'd offered his hand to her, the look of hurt on his face when she refused to take it. I recalled how he'd saved my life and gone out on a limb for my sake, risking even the success of his mission to help me out of a jam. I wouldn't be here now, alive, if not for Kurda Smahlt.</p><p>I started to rise, to speak up for him and request a less horrible form of retribution. Then Gavner's face flashed through my mind, and Arra's, and I stopped to think what he'd have done if Mr. Crepsley, Seba, or any others had gotten in his way. He would have killed all of them if he'd had to. He wouldn't have taken pleasure in it, but he wouldn't have stopped either. He'd have done what he felt needed to be done, the same as any true-hearted vampire.</p><p>Sinking back, I shook my head miserably and held my tongue. This was too big. It wasn't for me to decide. Kurda had fashioned his own downfall. He must stand alone to face it. I felt lousy, not sticking up for him, but I'd have felt just as lousy if I had.</p><p>When it became apparent that the judgment of the Princes was not going to be called into question, Paris signaled the guards on the platform, who surrounded Kurda and stripped him bare. Kurda said nothing as they robbed him of his clothes and pride, just gazed up at the roof of the Hall.</p><p>When Kurda was na**d, Paris held his fingers together tight, dipped them in a bowl of snake's blood that had been hidden behind his throne, and ran his hand over Kurda's chest. Mika and Arrow followed suit, leaving three ugly red marks - the sign among the vampires for a traitor or one of bad standing.</p><p>Once Kurda had been marked, his guards led him away. Nobody spoke or made a sound. He kept his head bowed low as he exited, but I saw tears dripping down his cheeks as he passed. He was lonely and scared. I wanted to comfort him, but it was too late for that. Better to let him pass without delay.</p><p>This time, as he was guided past the assembled vampires, nobody jeered or tried to harm him. There was a brief pause when he reached the open doors, to clear the way through the vampires packed beyond, then he was escorted out of the Hall and down through the tunnels to the Hall of Death, where he was caged, blindfolded, raised above the pit of stakes, then brutally and painfully executed. And that was the end of the traitor... my friend... Kurda Smahlt.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-ONE</p><p>Ididn't go to watch Kurda being killed. Nor did I stick around for the trials of the vampaneze. Instead, I returned to my cell, where I remained until it was time, late the next night, for the funerals of Arra Sails, Gavner Purl, and the others who'd died fighting to protect Vampire Mountain. Gavner's body had been recovered after the battle. Kurda told his guards where to find it, and a search party soon located it, stuffed into a deep crack far down the mountain.</p><p>Streak and his fellow wolf had returned to the pack. They slipped away without a fuss, not long after the fighting had finished, leaving their dead companion behind. I never had a chance to say good-bye or thank them.</p><p>I wondered if I'd ever run with the pack again. It seemed unlikely, even if my life was spared by the Princes. Now that Council was coming to an end, the wolves would be dispersing, to return to their usual hunting grounds. I'd probably seen the last of Streak, Rudi, and the rest.</p><p>I spent the time between the trials and the funerals working on my diary. I hadn't touched it since coming to Vampire Mountain. I read back over my earlier entries, then described all that had happened to me since I left the Cirque Du Freak and set out for the mountain with Mr. Crepsley. I managed to lose myself in the diary, so time flew by. I normally didn't enjoy writing - too much like homework - but once I started telling the story, the words tumbled out with hardly any effort. My pen only paused a couple of times, when I slipped away to eat and caught an hour or two of sleep.</p><p>I hoped the writing would help me get things straight in my head, especially with regards to Kurda, but I was just as confused by the end as I'd been at the beginning. No matter how I looked at it, I couldn't help feeling that Kurda had been both a hero and a villain. Things would be simpler if he was one or the other, but I couldn't pigeonhole him. It was just too complicated.</p><p>Kurda had wanted to prevent the destruction of the vampires. To that end, he'd betrayed them. Was he evil for doing so? Or would it have been worse to act nobly and let his people perish? Should you stay true to your friends, whatever the consequences? I found it impossible to decide. Part of me hated Kurda and believed he deserved to be killed; another part remembered his good intentions and amiable manner and wished there'd been some other way of punishing him, short of execution.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley came to fetch Harkat and me before I finished writing. I'd gotten most of the story down, but there was a bit left, so I stuck my pen between a couple of pages to mark my place, set it aside, and accompanied the sorrowful vampire to the Hall of Cremation to bid farewell to our dear departed friends and allies.</p><p>Gavner Purl was the first to be cremated, since he was the first who'd fallen. He'd been dressed in a simple white robe and placed on a thin stretcher in the cremation pit. He looked peaceful lying there, eyes closed, short brown hair carefully combed, lips worked into a smile by the Guardians of the Blood who'd prepared his body. Though I knew the Guardians had removed all of Gavner's blood, along with most of his internal organs and brain, there were no visible signs of their handiwork.</p><p>I started to tell Mr. Crepsley what Gavner's final words had been, but as I did, I burst into tears. Mr. Crepsley wrapped his arms around me and let me sob into his chest, patting me comfortingly. \"Do you want to leave?\" he asked.</p><p>\"No,\" I moaned. \"I want to stay. It's just... hard, you know?\"</p><p>\"I know,\" Mr. Crepsley said, and by the tears in his own eyes, I knew he meant it.</p><p>A large crowd had gathered to see Gavner off. Usually, only someone's closest friends or colleagues attended a funeral. Vampires were different from humans - they didn't believe in showing up in large numbers to pay their condolences. But Gavner had been popular and had died to save others, so the cave was full. Even Paris Skyle and Arrow were present. Mika would have been there too, except someone had to stay behind to guard the Hall of Princes.</p><p>There was no such thing as a vampire priest. Though vampires had their own gods and beliefs, they had no organized religion. Paris, as the oldest vampire in the chamber, led the brief, simple ceremonies. \"His name was Gavner Purl,\" he chanted, and everyone repeated the Prince's words. \"He died with honor.\" Again we followed. \"May his spirit find Paradise,\" he finished, and once we'd echoed his sentiments, the twigs and leaves beneath Gavner were lit by two Guardians, who made peculiar signs over his body, then moved back out of the way.</p><p>It didn't take the flames long to consume the General. The Guardians knew their business and had arranged things so the fire grew quickly and made short work of Gavner. I'd never been to a cremation before. To my surprise, I found it wasn't as upsetting as I'd thought it would be. There was something strangely comforting in watching the flames engulf Gavner, the smoke rising and slipping through the cracks in the ceiling, almost as if it were Gavner's spirit departing.</p><p>I was glad that I'd come, though I was grateful that we were ushered out of the Hall when it was time to extract Gavner's bones from the ashes and grind them to dust in the bowls that surrounded the pit. I don't think I could have stood by and watched the Guardians doing that.</p><p>Three more vampires were going to be cremated before it was Arra Sails's turn. While Mr. Crepsley, Harkat, and I waited outside during the ceremonies, Seba Nile and Vanez Blane appeared, the limping quartermaster leading the blind games master. The pair greeted us and stopped to chat. They apologized for missing Gavner's cremation, but Vanez had been undergoing treatment and couldn't leave until the dressing on his bad eye had been changed.</p><p>\"How is the eye?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"Ruined,\" Vanez said cheerfully, as though it was no big thing. \"I'm blind as a bat now.\"</p><p>\"I thought, since you were having it treated...?</p><p>\"The treatment will stop infection from setting in and spreading to my brain,\" Vanez explained.</p><p>\"You don't sound too upset,\" I noted, staring at the large patch over his right eye, thinking how awful it must be to lose one's sight.</p><p>Vanez shrugged. \"I'd rather have kept it, but it's not the end of the world. I can still hear, smell, and feel my way around. It will take a while to get used to, but I learned to adapt when I lost the first eye. I'm sure I'll be able to cope without the second.\"</p><p>\"Will you leave Vampire Mountain?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"No,\" Vanez said. \"Any other time, I'd have gone out into the world and stumbled around until I met with a noble end, as is a blind vampire's way. But the coming of the Vampaneze Lord has changed all that. Paris asked me to stay. I can make myself useful, even if it's only helping out in the stores or kitchens. Right now, every vampire's needed. My remaining will allow some younger, fitter vampire to focus his energies elsewhere and carry the fight to the vampaneze.\"</p><p>\"I too shall be staying,\" Seba announced. \"My retirement has been put on hold. The world and its adventures will have to wait. The old and infirm must play their part now, selflessly. This is no time for putting one's own best interests before those of the clan.\"</p><p>That phrase gave me a jolt. Kurda had expressed similar sentiments earlier during my stay. He thought it was wrong that crippled or old vampires were discarded by their colleagues. It was horribly ironic that his betrayal and death should serve as the spur to win over other vampires to his way of thinking.</p><p>\"Does that mean the offer of a job no longer stands?\" Mr. Crepsley asked Seba - he'd been earmarked to take over as quartermaster when Seba retired.</p>","<p>\"It does,\" Seba said, \"but I am sure the Princes will find some use for you.\" He smiled briefly. \"A sweeper of floors, perhaps?\"</p><p>\"Perhaps.\" Mr. Crepsley also managed a fleeting smile. \"Mika has already asked me about staying and perhaps resuming my official General duties, but I told him I did not wish to consider such things at the moment. I will decide later, when I have had time to mull the situation over.\"</p><p>\"What about Darren?\" Vanez asked. \"Have the Princes declared his fate yet?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Mika promised to reopen the debate first thing after the funeral ceremonies. I am sure he will be pardoned.\"</p><p>\"I hope so,\" Vanez said, but he sounded unsure. \"You do know that a death penalty has never been revoked? The Princes would have to alter the laws in order to spare Darren's life.\"</p><p>\"Then alter them they shall!\" Mr. Crepsley growled, taking a step forward in anger.</p><p>\"Peace, Larten,\" Seba interceded. \"Vanez means no harm. This is an unusual case, and it will require much thought before a final decision can be made, one way or the other.\"</p><p>\"There is no 'one way or the other,\" Mr. Crepsley insisted. \"I promised Arra I would not let Darren be killed. She said he had earned the right to life, and anyone who would argue with her dying wish will have me to deal with. We have endured enough death. I will not stand for any more.\"</p><p>\"Hopefully, there will be none,\" Seba sighed. \"I believe the Princes will be sympathetic. They may not wish to bend the laws, but in this case I think they will.\"</p><p>\"They had better,\" Mr. Crepsley said, and he would have said more, except at that moment Arra was brought forward on a stretcher and carried into the Hall of Cremation. Mr. Crepsley stiffened and stared after her longingly. I put an arm around him and so did Seba.</p><p>\"Be brave, Larten,\" Seba said. \"She would not have wanted emotional outbursts.\"</p><p>\"I will conduct myself with all due decorum,\" Mr. Crepsley said pompously, then added beneath his breath, \"but I miss her. With all my heart and soul, I miss her.\"</p><p>Once Arra's body had been placed, the doors were opened and we entered, Mr. Crepsley in front, Seba, Vanez, Harkat, and I just behind, to say our farewells. Mr. Crepsley was every bit as composed as he'd sworn he would be. He didn't even shed a tear when the funeral litter was set alight. It was only later, when he was alone in his cell, that he wept loudly, and his cries echoed through the corridors and tunnels of Vampire Mountain, far into the cold, lonely dawn.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-TWO</p><p>The long wait betweenthe cremations and my trial was awful. Though Mr. Crepsley kept saying I would be pardoned for failing my Trials of Initiation and forgiven for running away, I wasn't so sure. Working on my diary kept my mind off the upcoming trial, but once I'd brought it up-to-date and checked to make sure I hadn't left anything out, there was nothing to do but sit back and twiddle my thumbs.</p><p>Finally, two guards appeared and told me the Princes were ready to receive me. I asked for a few minutes to compose myself. They stood outside the door of my cell while I faced Harkat. \"Here,\" I said, handing him a bag (which used to belong to a friend of mine - Sam Grest) with my diary and some personal items. \"If they decide to execute me, I want you to have these.\"</p><p>Harkat nodded solemnly, then followed as I exited the cell and let the guards guide me to the Hall of Princes. Mr. Crepsley also fell in behind, having been notified by a third mountain guard.</p><p>We paused outside the doors of the Hall. My belly was rumbling with fear, and I was trembling all over. \"Be brave,\" Mr. Crepsley whispered. \"The Princes will treat you fairly. In the event that they do not, I shall come to your aid.\"</p><p>\"Me too,\" Harkat said. \"I won't let... them do anything... crazy to you.\"</p><p>\"Thanks,\" I said with a smile, \"but I don't want either of you to get involved. Things are bad enough as they are. No point all three of us winding up in the Hall of Death!\"</p><p>The doors opened and we entered.</p><p>The vampires within looked solemn and their heavy gazes did nothing to ease my discomfort. Nobody spoke as we marched to the platform where the Princes sat waiting, stern, arms crossed. The air seemed thin, and I had to gasp deeply for breath.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley and Harkat sat at the base of the platform, next to Seba Nile and Vanez Blane. I was led up onto it, where I stood facing the Vampire Princes. After a short period of silence, Paris Skyle spoke. \"These are strange times,\" he sighed. \"For centuries, we vampires have stuck by our old ways and traditions and looked on, amused, as humanity changed and evolved, growing ever more fractured. While the humans of this planet have lost their sense of direction and purpose, our belief in ourselves has never wavered - until recently.</p><p>\"It is a sign of the times that one vampire would raise his hand against his brothers, regardless of his good intentions. Treachery is nothing new to mankind, but this is our first real taste of it, and it has left a sour taste in our mouths. It would be easy to turn a blind eye to the traitors and dismiss them from our thoughts. But that would be to ignore the root of our problem and leave the way open for further acts of treason. The truth is that the changing world has made its mark upon us at last, and we must change if we are to survive within it.</p><p>\"While we have no plans to abandon our ways outright, we must face the future and adapt as required. We have been living in a world of absolutes, but this is no longer the case. We must open our eyes, ears, and hearts to new ways of thinking and living.</p><p>\"That is why we have gathered here tonight. In the normal course of things, there would have been no call for a meeting to decide Darren Shan's fate. He failed the Trials of Initiation - the penalty for which is death. He then fled from sentencing, a crime punishable in only one way - death. In the past, he would have been put to the stakes, and none would have intervened on his behalf.</p><p>\"But times have changed, and Darren has played an instrumental part in opening our eyes to the need for change. He has endured great pain and sacrificed his freedom for the good of the clan. He has fought bravely and proven his worth. Previously, his reward would have been a noble death. Now, however, pleas have been submitted, arguing for his right to live.\"</p><p>Paris cleared his throat and sipped from a glass of blood. The air in the Hall was alive with tension. I couldn't see the faces of the vampires behind me, but I could feel their eyes boring into my back.</p><p>\"We have argued your case at great length,\" Paris continued. \"In the world of humans, I imagine it would have been easy to reach a conclusion, and you would have been openly pardoned. But we view justice differently. To clear your name and free you would mean altering the very fabric of our laws.</p><p>\"Some have claimed that it is time to fine-tune the laws. They put forward a convincing case on your behalf. They said laws were made to be broken, a sentiment I do not agree with, but which I am beginning to understand. Others wanted the laws pertaining to the Trials of Initiation temporarily waived. In that case, you would have been cleared, then the laws would have been reinstated. A few called for permanent, outright changes. They felt the laws were unfair and - keeping in mind the threat posed by the coming of the Vampaneze Lord - senseless, in that they might work to rob us of new recruits and weaken our hand.\"</p><p>Paris hesitated and ran his fingers through his long grey beard. \"After lengthy debate, much of it heated, we decided against altering our laws. There may come a time when we will have to, but -?</p><p>\"Charna's guts!\" Mr. Crepsley roared, and the next thing I knew, he'd jumped onto the platform and was standing in front of me, fists raised. Moments later, Harkat had joined him, and the two faced the Princes and glared. \"I will not stand for this!\" Mr. Crepsley shouted. \"Darren risked his life for you, and now you would sentence him to death? Never! I will not tolerate such bloody-minded ingratitude. Anyone wishing to lay hands on my assistant will first have to lay hands on me, and I swear by all that is sacred, I will fight them to my last savage breath!\"</p><p>\"The same goes... for me,\" Harkat growled, tearing loose the mask from around his mouth, his scarred grey face even more fearsome-looking than usual.</p><p>\"I expected more self-control, Larten,\" Paris tutted, not in the least disturbed. \"This is most unlike you.\"</p><p>\"Desperate times call for desperate measures,\" Mr. Crepsley retorted. \"There is a time for tradition, and there is a time to exercise common sense. I will not let you -?</p><p>\"Larten,\" Seba called from the crowd. Mr. Crepsley half-turned at the sound of his mentor's voice. \"You should hear Paris out,\" Seba suggested.</p><p>\"You agree with them?\" Mr. Crepsley howled.</p><p>\"Actually,\" Seba replied, \"I argued for change. But when the motion was defeated, I accepted it, as any loyal vampire would.\"</p><p>\"The hell with loyalty!\" Mr. Crepsley barked. \"If this is the price of loyalty, perhaps Kurda was right. Maybe it would have been for the best to turn this place over to the vampaneze!\"</p><p>\"You do not mean that.\" Seba smiled. \"Step down, take your seat, and let Paris finish. You are making a fool of yourself.\"</p><p>\"But -\" Mr. Crepsley began.</p><p>\"Larten,\" Seba snapped impatiently. \"Down!\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley's head dropped. \"Very well,\" he sighed. \"I shall bow to your will and hear Paris out. But I am not leaving Darren's side, and anyone who tries to force me from this platform shall live to regret it.\"</p><p>\"It is all right, Seba,\" Paris said as the quartermaster opened his mouth to argue. \"Larten and the Little Person may remain.\" Once that had been settled, Paris continued with his speech. \"As I said, we opted not to alter our laws. There may come a time when we have to, but we would rather not rush headlong into such a course of action. Change should be gradual. We must avoid panic and anarchy.</p><p>\"Having agreed upon the need to be true to our laws, we searched for a loophole that Darren could take advantage of. Nobody in this Hall wished for his death. Even those most strenuously opposed to changes in the laws racked their brains in the hope that an escape clause would present itself.</p><p>\"We considered the possibility of letting Darren 'escape' a second time, of relaxing the guard and allowing him to slip away with our unofficial blessing. But there would have been no honor in such a strategy. Darren would have been shamed; you, Larten, would have been shamed; and we who agreed to the compromise would also have been shamed.</p><p>\"We decided against it.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley bristled, then addressed the Princes in a whisper. \"Arra made me promise, on her deathbed, that I would not let Darren die. I beg you - do not force me to choose between loyalty to you and my vow to her.\"</p><p>\"There will be no need to choose,\" Paris said. \"There is no conflict of interests, as will become apparent as soon as you shut up and let me finish.\" He smiled as he said this. Then, raising his voice, he again addressed the Hall. \"As those who were present during the debate know, Arrow was the first to suggest an honorable way out of our dilemma.\"</p><p>\"I don't know how I thought of it,\" Arrow grunted, running a hand over his bald head, grimacing. \"I've never been known as a great thinker. Normally, I act first and think later - if at all! - but a thought was swimming like a fish, deep within the ocean of my brain, and eventually it surfaced.\"</p><p>\"The solution,\" Paris said, \"is simplicity itself. We do not need to bend or change the laws to suit Darren's purposes. Instead, we need only place him above them.\"</p><p>\"I do not understand.\" Mr. Crepsley frowned.</p><p>\"Think, Larten,\" Paris urged. \"Who among us are immune to punishment? Who could fail the Trials of Initiation a dozen times and walk away untouched?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley's eyes widened. \"You cannot mean...?\" he gasped.</p><p>\"We do,\" Paris smirked.</p><p>\"But... it is incomprehensible! He is too young! He is not a General! He is not even a full-vampire!\"</p><p>\"Who cares?\" Mika Ver Leth chipped in, making a wry face. \"We're not interested in the fine print. He's earned the right to bear the title. More than any of us here, perhaps, he is worthy.\"</p><p>\"This is insane,\" Mr. Crepsley said, but he was beginning to smile.</p><p>\"Possibly,\" Paris agreed. \"But it was put to a vote, and all voted in favor of it.\"</p><p>\"All?\" Mr. Crepsley blinked.</p><p>\"Every single vampire in the Hall.\" Mika nodded.</p><p>\"Excuse me,\" I whispered to Mr. Crepsley, \"but what's going on? What are you talking about?\"</p><p>\"Be quiet,\" he hushed me. \"I will explain presently.\" He thought over the Princes' proposition - whatever it was - and his smile grew wider. \"It makes sense, in a mad sort of way,\" he muttered. \"But surely the title would be honorary? He knows so little of our ways, and he is so young and inexperienced.\"</p><p>\"We would not expect him to engage in regular duties,\" Paris said. \"He has much to learn, and we will not rush his development. We will not even make a full-vampire of him - though we must share our blood, we will limit the amount, so he remains a half-vampire. But the appointment will be valid. He will not be a figurehead. He will hold all the responsibilities and powers of the post.\"</p><p>\"Look,\" I grumbled, \"tell me what's going on, or -\" Mr. Crepsley bent and whispered something in my ear. \"What?\" I snapped, and he whispered some more. \"You can't be serious!\" I yelped, feeling the blood rush from my face. \"You're pulling my leg!\"</p><p>\"It is the only honorable way,\" he said.</p>","<p>\"But... I couldn't... I'm not... I never...\" I shook my head and stared around at the vampires packing the Hall of Princes. They were all smiling now and nodding at me. Seba looked especially pleased. \"That group agreed to it?\" I asked weakly.</p><p>\"Every one of them,\" Paris said. \"They respect you, Darren. They also admire you. What you have done for us shall never be forgotten as long as vampires walk the Earth. We wish to show our appreciation, and this is the only way we know.\"</p><p>\"I'm amazed,\" I mumbled. \"I don't know what to say.\"</p><p>\"Say yes,\" Arrow laughed, \"or we'll have to take you down to the Hall of Death and punch a few holes in you!\"</p><p>Looking up at Mr. Crepsley, I squinted, then smiled. \"You'd have to obey me if I went along with this, wouldn't you?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Of course.\" He grinned. \"I and all others.\"</p><p>\"You'd have to do whatever I said?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" He lowered his voice. \"But do not think you could push me around. I will respect your standing, but I will not let your head swell unchecked. You will still be my assistant, and I will keep you in your rightful place!\"</p><p>\"I bet you will,\" I chuckled, then faced Paris and drew myself up straight. I stood on the verge of a monumental decision that would change my life forever. I'd have liked a few nights to think about it, but there was no time. It was this or the Hall of Death - and anything was preferable to being dropped on the vicious stakes! \"What do I have to do?\" I asked.</p><p>\"There is a lengthy, involved ceremony,\" Paris said, \"but that can be postponed until later. Right now all you need to do is accept our blood and offer some of your own to the Stone of Blood. Once you have been recognized by the Stone, the deed is done, and it can never be reversed.\"</p><p>\"OK,\" I said nervously.</p><p>\"Step forward then,\" Paris said, \"and let the pact be sealed.\"</p><p>As I advanced, Mr. Crepsley told Harkat what was going on, and I heard him exclaim, \"No way!\" I found it impossible to hide my grin during the ceremony, even though everybody else in the Hall remained solemn-faced.</p><p>First, I removed my shirt. Then Arrow, Mika, and I gathered around the Stone of Blood (only two Princes were required for the ceremony). Using my sharp nails, I cut into the fleshy tips of my ten fingers, drawing blood. Arrow and Mika did the same. When we were ready, Arrow pressed the bloody fingertips of one of his hands to mine, and Mika did the same on the other side. Then the pair laid their free hands on the Stone of Blood, which glowed red and emitted a low thrumming noise.</p><p>I could feel the blood of the Princes flowing into me and mine into them. It was an unpleasant sensation, but it wasn't as painful as it had been when Mr. Crepsley first blooded me all those years ago.</p><p>The Stone of Blood glowed brighter the longer we remained joined to it, and the outer rim became transparent, so that I was able to see inside it and watch as my blood was added to that of thousands of other creatures of the night.</p><p>Stray thoughts zipped frenziedly through my mind. I remembered the night when Mr. Crepsley blooded me. My first real drink of blood, when Sam Grest lay dying in my arms. The vampaneze I'd killed in the cave. The mad vampaneze - Murlough. Steve Leopard - my best friend when I was a human, who'd sworn to track me down and kill me when he grew up. Debbie Hemlock and the softness of her lips when we kissed. Gavner - laughing. Mr. Tall directing his performers at the Cirque Du Freak. Harkat telling me his name after we'd killed the rabid bear. Truska (the bearded lady) dressing me up in a pirate costume. Arra - winking. Mr. Tiny with his heart-shaped watch and loveless eyes. Kurda facing the hall of vampires. Annie and how she used to tease me. Sticking stamps into albums with Mom. Pulling weeds in the garden with Dad. Gavner, Arra, Sam Grest - dying.</p><p>I grew faint and would have fallen, but Paris darted behind me and propped me up. The blood was flowing rapidly now, and so were the images. Faces from the past, friends and enemies, moving as fast as the frames of a movie, then faster. Just when I thought I couldn't stand it anymore, Arrow and Mika removed their hands from the Stone of Blood, then broke contact with me, signaling the end of the ceremony. As I slumped backward, Paris quickly rubbed spit onto the tips of my fingers to stop the bleeding. \"How do you feel?\" he asked, checking my eyes.</p><p>\"Weak,\" I muttered.</p><p>\"Give it a few hours,\" he said. \"Once the blood kicks in, you will feel like a panther!\"</p><p>The sound of cheering reached my ears, and I realized all the vampires in the hall were hollering their heads off. \"What are they shouting about?\" I asked.</p><p>\"They want to see you,\" Paris said, smiling. \"They wish to grant their approval.\"</p><p>\"Can't they wait?\" I asked. \"I'm exhausted.\"</p><p>\"We shall carry you,\" Paris said. \"It would not do to keep your subjects waiting... sire.\"</p><p>\"'Sire,\" I repeated and grinned, liking the sound of it.</p><p>The three Princes lifted me up and placed me on their shoulders. I laughed and stared at the ceiling as they carried me forward, marveling at this bizarre twist of fate, wondering what the future would hold and if anything could ever compare with this.</p><p>As they put me down so that I could take the applause of the vampires on my feet, I gazed around and noted the beaming faces of Mr. Crepsley, Harkat, Seba Nile, Vanez Blane, and the others. At the back of the hall, I thought I spotted the ghostly shades of Gavner and Arra and - just behind them - Kurda, applauding silently. But that must have been an effect of the dizziness caused by the addition of the Princes' blood.</p><p>Then the faces blurred, and I was staring out at a sea of yelling vampires, one the same as the next. Letting my eyes close, I stood there, shaky on my feet, rocking from the vibrations of their roars, proud as a peacock, listening numbly as they chanted my name and cheered for me - me...</p>"]},{"title":"Hunters of the Dusk","pages":["<p>PROLOGUE</p><p>IT WAS an age of tragic mistakes. For me, the tragedy began fourteen years earlier when, mesmerized by a vampire's amazing performing tarantula, I stole it from him. After an initially successful theft, everything went to hell, and I paid for my crime with my humanity. Faking my own death, I left my family and home, and travelled the world with the Cirque Du Freak, as the assistant to a blood-drinking creature of the night.</p><p>My name's Darren Shan. I'm a half-vampire.</p><p>I'm also - through a series of events so astounding I still have trouble believing they really happened - a Vampire Prince. The Princes are the leaders of the vampire clan, respected and obeyed by all. There are only five of them - the others are Paris Skyle, Mika Ver Leth, Arrow and Vancha March.</p><p>I'd been a Prince for six years, living within the Halls of Vampire Mountain (the stronghold of the clan), learning the customs and traditions of my people, and how to be a vampire of good standing. I'd also been learning the ways of warfare, and how to use weapons. The rules of battle were essential components of any vampire's education, but now more so than ever - because we were at war.</p><p>Our opponents were the vampaneze, our purple-skinned blood-cousins. They're a lot like vampires in many ways, but alien to us in one key area - they kill whenever they drink blood. Vampires don't harm those they feed from - we simply take a small amount of blood from each human we target - but vampaneze believe it's shameful to feed without draining their victims dry.</p><p>Though there was no love lost between the vampires and vampaneze, for hundreds of years an uneasy truce had existed between the two clans. That changed six years ago when a group of vampaneze - aided by a vampire traitor called Kurda Smahlt - stormed Vampire Mountain in an attempt to seize control of the Hall of Princes. We defeated them (thanks largely to my discovery of the plot prior to their assault), then interrogated the survivors, baffled by why they should choose to attack.</p><p>Unlike vampires, vampaneze had no leaders - they were entirely democratic - but when they split from the vampires six hundred years ago, a mysterious, powerful magician known as Mr. Tiny paid them a visit and placed the Coffin of Fire in their possession. This coffin burnt alive anyone who lay within it - but Mr. Tiny said that one night a man would lie down in it and step out unharmed, and that man would lead them into a victorious war with the vampires, establishing the vampaneze as the unopposed rulers of the night.</p><p>During the interrogation, we learnt to our horror that the Lord of the Vampaneze had finally arisen, and vampaneze across the world were preparing for the violent, bloody war to come.</p><p>Once our assailants had been put to a painful death, word spread from Vampire Mountain like wildfire: \"We're at war with the vampaneze!\" And we'd been locked in combat with them ever since, fighting grimly, desperate to disprove Mr. Tiny's dark prophecy - that we were destined to lose the war and be wiped from the face of the earth...</p><p>Chapter ONE</p><p>IT WAS another long, tiring night in the Hall of Princes. A Vampire General called Staffen Irve was reporting to me and Paris Skyle. Paris was the oldest living vampire, with more than eight hundred years under his belt. He had flowing white hair, a long, grey beard, and had lost his right ear in a fight many decades ago.</p><p>Staffen Irve had been active in the field for three years, and had been giving us a quick rundown of his experiences in the War of the Scars, as it had come to be known (a reference to the scars on our fingertips, the common mark of a vampire or vampaneze). It was a strange war. There were no big battles and neither side used missile-firing weapons - vampires and vampaneze fight only with hand to hand weapons like swords, clubs and spears. The war was a series of isolated skirmishes, three or four vampires at a time pitting themselves against a similar number of vampaneze, fighting to the death.</p><p>\"There was four of us 'gainst three of them,\" Staffen Irve said, telling us about one of his more recent encounters. \"But my lads was dry behind the tonsils, while the vampaneze was battle-hardy. I killed one of 'em but the others got away, leaving two of my lads dead and the third with a useless arm.</p><p>\"Have any of the vampaneze spoken of their Lord?\" Paris asked.</p><p>\"No, Sire. Those I take alive only laugh at my questions, even under torture.\"</p><p>In the six years that we'd been hunting for their Lord, there'd been no sign of him. We knew he hadn't been blooded - various vampaneze had told us that he was learning their ways before becoming one of them - and the general opinion was that if we were to have any chance of thwarting Mr. Tiny's predictions, we had to find and kill their Lord before he assumed full control of the clan.</p><p>A cluster of Generals was waiting to speak with Paris. They moved forward as Staffen Irve departed, but I signalled them back. Picking up a mug of warm blood, I passed it to the one-eared Prince. He smiled and drank deeply, then wiped red stains from around his mouth with the back of a trembling hand - the responsibility of running the war council was taking its toll on the ancient vampire.</p><p>\"Do you want to call it a night?\" I asked, worried about Paris's health.</p><p>He shook his head. \"The night is young,\" he muttered.</p><p>\"But you are not,\" said a familiar voice behind me - Mr. Crepsley. The vampire in the red cloak spent most of his time by my side, advising and encouraging me. He was in a peculiar position. As an ordinary vampire, he held no recognizable rank, and could be commanded by the lowliest of Generals. Yet as my guardian he wielded the unofficial powers of a Prince (since I followed his advice practically all the time). The reality was that Mr. Crepsley was second in charge only to Paris Skyle, yet nobody openly acknowledged this. Vampire protocol - go figure!</p><p>\"You should rest,\" Mr. Crepsley said to Paris, laying a hand on the Prince's shoulder. \"This war will run a long time. You must not exhaust yourself too early. We will have need of you later.\"</p><p>\"Rot!\" Paris laughed. \"You and Darren are the future. I am the past, Larten. I will not live to see the end of this war if it drags on as long as we fear. If I do not make my mark now, I never will.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley started to object, but Paris silenced him with the crooking of a finger. \"An old owl hates to be told how young and virile he is. I am on my last legs, and anyone who says otherwise is a fool, a liar, or both.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley tilted his head obediently. \"Very well. I will not argue with you.\"</p><p>\"I should hope not,\" Paris sniffed, then shifted tiredly on his throne. \"But this has been a taxing night. I will talk with these Generals, then crawl off to my coffin to sleep. Will Darren be able to manage without me?\"</p>","<p>\"Darren will manage,\" Mr. Crepsley said confidently, and stood slightly behind me as the Generals advanced, ready to advise when required.</p><p>Paris didn't make his coffin by dawn. The Generals had much to argue about - by studying reports on the movements of the vampaneze they were trying to pinpoint the possible hiding place of their Lord - and it was close to midday before the ancient Prince slipped away.</p><p>I treated myself to a short break, grabbed some food, then heard from three of the Mountain's fighting tutors, who were training the latest batch of Generals. After that I had to send two new Generals out into the field for their first taste of combat. I quickly went through the small ceremony - I had to daub their foreheads with vampire blood and mutter an ancient war prayer over them - then wished them luck and sent them off to kill vampaneze - or die.</p><p>Then it was time for vampires to approach me with a wide range of problems and queries. As a Prince I was expected to deal with every sort of subject under the moon. I was only a young, inexperienced half-vampire, who'd become a Prince more by default than merit, but the members of the clan placed their trust completely in their Princes, and I was afforded the same degree of respect as Paris or any of the others.</p><p>When the last vampire had departed, I snatched about three hours of sleep, in a hammock which I'd strung up at the rear of the Hall. When I woke, I ate some half-cooked, salted boar meat, washed down with water and followed by a small mug of blood. Then it was back to my throne for more planning, plotting and reports.</p><p>Chapter TWO</p><p>I SNAPPED out of sleep to the sound of screaming.</p><p>Jerking awake, I fell out of my hammock, on to the hard, cold floor of my rocky cell. My hand automatically darted for the short sword which I kept strapped by my side at all times. Then the fog of sleep cleared and I realized it was only Harkat, having a nightmare.</p><p>Harkat Mulds was a Little Person, a short creature who wore blue robes and worked for Mr. Tiny. He'd been human once, though he didn't remember who he used to be, or when or where he lived. When he died, his soul remained trapped on Earth, until Mr. Tiny brought him back to life in a new, stunted body.</p><p>\"Harkat,\" I mumbled, shaking him roughly. \"Wake up. You're dreaming again.\"</p><p>Harkat had no eyelids, but his large green eyes dimmed when he was asleep. Now the light in them flared and he moaned loudly, rolling out of his hammock, as I had moments before. \"Dragons!\" he screamed, voice muffled by the mask he always wore - he wasn't able to breathe normal air for more than ten or twelve hours, and without the mask he'd die. \"Dragons!\"</p><p>\"No,\" I sighed. \"You've been dreaming.\"</p><p>Harkat stared at me with his unnatural green eyes, then relaxed and tugged his mask down, revealing a wide, grey, jagged gash of a mouth. \"Sorry, Darren. Did I wake... you?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I lied. \"I was up already.\"</p><p>I swung back on to my hammock and sat gazing at Harkat. There was no denying he was an ugly build of a creature. Short and squat, with dead, grey skin, no visible ears or a nose - he had ears stitched beneath the skin of his scalp, but was without a sense of smell or taste. He'd no hair, round, green eyes, sharp little teeth and a dark grey tongue. His face had been stitched together, like Frankenstein's monster.</p><p>Of course, I was no model myself - few vampires were! My face, body and limbs were laced with scars and burn marks, many picked up during my Trials of Initiation (which I'd passed at my second attempt, two years ago). I was also as bald as a baby, as a result of my first set of Trials, when I'd been badly burnt.</p><p>Harkat was one of my closest friends. He'd saved my life twice, when I was attacked by a wild bear on the trail to Vampire Mountain, then in a fight with savage boars during my first, failed Trials of Initiation. It bothered me to see him so disturbed by the nightmares which had been plaguing him for the last few years.</p><p>\"Was this nightmare the same as the others?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he nodded. \"I was wandering in a vast wasteland. The sky was red. I was searching for something but I didn't... know what. There were pits full of stakes. A dragon attacked. I fought it off but... another appeared. Then another. Then...\" He sighed miserably.</p><p>Harkat's speech had improved greatly since he'd first started speaking. In the beginning he'd had to pause for breath after every two or three words, but he'd learnt to control his breathing technique and now only stalled during long sentences.</p><p>\"Were the shadow men there?\" I asked. Sometimes he dreamt of shadowy figures who chased and tormented him.</p><p>\"Not this time,\" he said, \"though I think they'd have appeared if you... hadn't woken me up.\" Harkat was sweating - his sweat was a pale green colour - and his shoulders shook slightly. He suffered greatly in his sleep, and stayed awake as long as he could, only sleeping four or five hours out of every seventy-two.</p><p>\"Want something to eat or drink?\" I asked.</p><p>\"No,\" he said. \"Not hungry.\" He stood and stretched his burly arms. He was only wearing a cloth around his waist, so I could see his smooth stomach and chest - Harkat had no nipples or belly button.</p><p>\"It's good to see you,\" he said, pulling on his blue robes, which he'd never grown out of the habit of wearing. \"It's been ages since... we got together.\"</p><p>\"I know,\" I groaned. \"This war business is killing me, but I can't leave Paris to deal with it alone. He needs me.\"</p><p>\"How is Sire Skyle?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"Bearing up. But it's hard. So many decisions to make, so many troops to organize, so many vampires to send to their death.\"</p><p>We were silent a while, thinking about the War of the Scars and the vampires - including some very good friends of ours - who'd perished in it.</p><p>\"How've you been?\" I asked Harkat, shrugging off the morbid thoughts.</p><p>\"Busy,\" he said. \"Seba's working me harder all the time.\" After a few months of milling around Vampire Mountain, Harkat had gone to work for the quartermaster - Seba Nile - who was in charge of stocking and maintaining the Mountain's stores of food, clothes and weapons. Harkat started out moving crates and sacks around, but he'd learnt quickly about supplies and how to keep up with the needs of the vampires, and now served as Seba's senior assistant.</p><p>\"Do you have to return to the Hall of Princes soon?\" Harkat asked. \"Seba would like to see you. He wants to show you... some spiders.\" The mountain was home to thousands of arachnids, known as Ba'Halen's spiders.</p>","<p>\"I have to go back,\" I said regretfully, \"but I'll try to drop by soon.\"</p><p>\"Do,\" Harkat said seriously. \"You look exhausted. Paris is not the only one who... needs rest.\"</p><p>Harkat had to leave shortly afterwards to prepare for the arrival of a group of Generals. I lay in my hammock and stared at the dark rock ceiling, unable to get back to sleep. This was the cell Harkat and me had first shared when we came to Vampire Mountain. I liked this tiny cubbyhole - it was the closest thing I had to a bedroom - but rarely got to see much of it. Most of my nights were spent in the Hall of Princes, and the few free hours I had by day were normally passed eating or exercising.</p><p>I ran a hand over my bald head while I was resting and thought back over my Trials of Initiation. I'd sailed through them the second time. I didn't have to take them - as a Prince, I was under no obligation - but I wouldn't have felt right if I hadn't. By passing the Trials, I'd proved myself worthy of being a vampire.</p><p>Apart from the scars and burns, I hadn't changed much in the last six years. As a half-vampire, I only aged one year for every five that passed. I was a bit taller than when I left the Cirque Du Freak with Mr. Crepsley, and my features had thickened and matured slightly. But I wasn't a full-vampire and wouldn't change vastly until I became one. As a full-vampire I'd be much stronger. I'd also be able to heal cuts with my spit, breathe out a gas which could knock people unconscious, and communicate telepathically with other vampires. Plus I'd be able to flit, which is a super-fast speed vampires can attain. On the down side, I'd be vulnerable to sunlight and couldn't move about during the day.</p><p>But all that lay far ahead. Mr. Crepsley hadn't said anything about when I'd be fully blooded, but I gathered it wouldn't happen until I was an adult. That was ten or fifteen years away - my body was still that of a teenager - so I had loads of time to enjoy (or endure) my extended childhood.</p><p>I lay relaxing for another half hour, then got up and dressed. I'd taken to wearing light blue clothes, trousers and a tunic, covered by a long, regal-looking robe. My right thumb snagged on the arm of the tunic as I was pulling it on, as it often did - I'd broken the thumb six years ago and it still stuck out at an awkward angle.</p><p>Taking care not to rip the fabric on my extra tough nails - which could gouge holes in soft rock - I freed my thumb and finished dressing. I pulled on a pair of light shoes and ran a hand over my head to make sure I hadn't been bitten by ticks. They'd popped up all over the mountain recently, annoying everyone. Then I made my way back to the Hall of Princes for another long night of tactics and debate.</p><p>Chapter THREE</p><p>THE DOORS to the Hall of Princes could only be opened by a Prince, by laying a hand on the doors or touching a panel on the thrones inside the Hall. Nothing could breach the walls of the Hall, which had been built by Mr. Tiny and his Little People centuries before.</p><p>The Stone of Blood was housed in the Hall, and was of vital importance. It was a magical artefact. Any vampire who came to the mountain (most of the three thousand vampires in the world had made the trek at least once) laid their hands on the Stone and let it absorb some of their blood. The Stone could then be used to track that vampire down. So, if Mr. Crepsley wanted to know where Arrow was, he had only to lay his hands on the Stone and think about him, and within seconds he'd have a fix on the Prince. Or, if he thought of an area, the Stone would tell him how many vampires were there.</p><p>I couldn't use the Stone of Blood to search for others - only full-vampires were able to do that - but I could be traced through it, since it had taken blood from me when I became a Prince.</p><p>If the Stone ever fell into the hands of the vampaneze, they could use it to track down all the vampires who'd bonded with it. Hiding from them would be impossible. They'd annihilate us. Because of this danger, some vampires wanted to destroy the Stone of Blood - but there was a legend that it could save us in our hour of greatest need.</p><p>I was thinking about all this while Paris used the Stone of Blood to manoeuvre troops in the field. As reports reached us of vampaneze positions, Paris used the Stone to check where his Generals were, then communicated telepathically with them, giving them orders to move from place to place. It was this which drained him so deeply. Others could have used the Stone, but as a Prince, Paris's word was law, and it was quicker for him to deliver the orders himself.</p><p>While Paris focused on the Stone, Mr. Crepsley and me spent much of our time putting field reports together and building up a clear picture of the movements of the vampaneze. Many other Generals were also doing this, but it was our job to take their findings, sort through them, pick out the more important nuggets, and make suggestions to Paris. We had loads of maps, with pins stuck in to mark the positions of vampires and vampaneze.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley had been intently studying a map for ten minutes, and he looked worried. \"Have you seen this?\" he asked eventually, summoning me over.</p><p>I stared at the map. There were three yellow flags and two red flags stuck close together around a city. We used five main colours to keep track of things. Blue flags for vampires. Yellow for vampaneze. Green for vampaneze strongholds - cities and towns which they defended like bases. White flags were stuck in places where we'd won fights. Red flags where we'd lost.</p><p>\"What am I looking for?\" I asked, staring at the yellow and red flags. My eyes were bleary from lack of sleep and too much concentrating on maps and poorly scrawled reports.</p><p>\"The name of the city,\" Mr. Crepsley said, running a fingernail over it.</p><p>The name meant nothing to me at first. Then my head cleared. \"That's your original home,\" I muttered. It was the city where Mr. Crepsley had lived when he was human. Twelve years ago, he'd returned, taking me and Evra Von - a snake-boy from the Cirque Du Freak - with him, to stop a mad vampaneze called Murlough, who'd gone on a killing spree.</p><p>\"Find the reports,\" Mr. Crepsley said. There was a number on each flag, linking it to reports in our files, so we knew exactly what each flag represented. After a few minutes, I found the relevant sheets of paper and quickly scanned them.</p><p>\"Of the vampaneze seen there,\" I muttered, \"two were heading into the city. The other was leaving. The first red flag's from a year ago - four Generals were killed in a large clash with several vampaneze.\"</p><p>\"And the second red flag marks the spot where Staffen Irve lost two of his men,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"It was when I was adding this flag to the map that I noticed the degree of activity around the city.\"</p>","<p>\"Do you think it means anything?\" I asked. It was unusual for so many vampaneze to be sighted in one location.</p><p>\"I am not sure,\" he said. \"The vampaneze may have made a base there, but I do not see why - it is out of the way of their other strongholds.\"</p><p>\"We could send someone to check,\" I suggested.</p><p>He considered that, then shook his head. \"We have already lost too many Generals there. It is not a strategically important site. Best to leave it alone.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley rubbed the long scar which divided the flesh on the left side of his face and went on staring at the map. He'd cut his orange crop of hair tighter than usual - most vampires were cutting their hair short, because of the ticks - and he looked almost bald in the strong light of the Hall.</p><p>\"It bothers you, doesn't it?\" I noted.</p><p>He nodded. \"If they have set up a base, they must be feeding on the humans. I still consider it home, and I do not like to think of my spiritual neighbours and relations suffering at the hands of the vampaneze.\"</p><p>\"We could send in a team to flush them out.\"</p><p>He sighed. \"That would not be fitting. I would be putting personal considerations before the welfare of the clan. If I ever get out in the field, I shall check on the situation myself, but there is no need to send others.\"</p><p>\"What are the odds on you and me ever getting out of here?\" I asked wryly. I didn't enjoy fighting, but after six years cooped up inside the mountain, I'd have given my fingernails for a few nights out in the open, even if it meant taking on a dozen vampaneze single-handed.</p><p>\"The way things stand - poor,\" Mr. Crepsley admitted. \"I think we will be stuck here until the end of the war. If one of the other Princes suffers a serious injury and withdraws from battle, we might have to replace him. Otherwise...\" He drummed his fingers on the map and grimaced.</p><p>\"You don't have to stay,\" I said quietly. \"There are plenty of others who could guide me.\"</p><p>He barked a laugh. \"There are plenty who would steer you,\" he agreed, \"but how many would clip you around the ear if you made an error?\"</p><p>\"Not many,\" I chuckled.</p><p>\"They think of you as a Prince,\" he said, \"whereas I still think of you first and foremost as a meddlesome little brat with a penchant for stealing spiders.\"</p><p>\"Charming!\" I huffed. I knew he was kidding - Mr. Crepsley always treated me with the respect my position deserved - but there was some truth to his teasing. There was a special bond between Mr. Crepsley and me, like between a father and son. He could say things to me that no other vampire would dare. I'd be lost without him.</p><p>Placing the map of Mr. Crepsley's former home to one side, we returned to the more important business of the night, little dreaming of the events which would eventually lead us back to the city of Mr. Crepsley's youth, or the awful confrontation with evil that awaited us there.</p><p>Chapter FOUR</p><p>THE HALLS and tunnels of Vampire Mountain were buzzing with excitement - Mika Ver Leth had returned after an absence of five years, and the rumour was that he had news of the Vampaneze Lord! I was in my cell, resting, when word broke. Wasting no time, I pulled on my clothes and hurried to the Hall of Princes at the top of the mountain, to check if the stories were true.</p><p>Mika was talking with Paris and Mr. Crepsley when I arrived, surrounded by a pack of Generals eager for news. He was clad entirely in black, as was his custom, and his hawklike eyes seemed darker and grimmer than ever. He raised one gloved hand in salute when he saw me pushing my way forward. I stood to attention and saluted back. \"How's the cub Prince?\" he asked with a quick, tight grin.</p><p>\"Not bad,\" I replied, studying him for signs of injury - many who returned to Vampire Mountain carried the scars of battle. But although Mika looked tired, he hadn't been visibly wounded. \"What about the Vampaneze Lord?\" I asked directly. \"According to the gossip, you know where he is.\"</p><p>Mika grimaced. \"If only!\" Looking around, he said, \"Shall we assemble? I have news, but I'd rather announce it to the Hall in general.\" Everyone present made straight for their seats. Mika settled on his throne and sighed contentedly. \"It's good to be back,\" he said, patting the arms of the hard chair. \"Has Seba been taking good care of my coffin?\"</p><p>\"To the vampaneze with your coffin!\" a General shouted, momentarily forgetting his place. \"What news of the Vampaneze Lord?\"</p><p>Mika ran a hand through his jet-black hair. \"First, let's make it clear - I don't know where he is.\" A groan spread through the Hall. \"But I've had word of him,\" Mika added, and all ears pricked up at that.</p><p>\"Before I begin,\" Mika said, \"do you know about the latest vampaneze recruits?\" Everybody looked blank. \"The vampaneze have been adding to their ranks since the start of the war, blooding more humans than usual, to drive their numbers up.\"</p><p>\"This is old news,\" Paris murmured. \"There are far fewer vampaneze than vampires in the world. We expected them to blood recklessly. It is nothing to worry about - we still outnumber them greatly.\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Mika said. \"But now they're also using unblooded humans. They call them 'vampets'. Apparently the Vampaneze Lord himself came up with the name. Like him, they're learning the rules of vampaneze life and warfare as humans, before being blooded. He plans to build an army of human helpers.\"</p><p>\"We can deal with humans,\" a General snarled, and there were shouts of agreement.</p><p>\"Normally,\" Mika agreed. \"But we must be wary of these vampets. While they lack the powers of the vampaneze, they're learning to fight like them. Also, since they aren't blooded, they don't have to abide by the more restrictive vampaneze laws. They aren't honour bound to tell the truth, they don't have to follow ancient customs - and they don't have to limit themselves to hand to hand weapons.\"</p><p>Angry mutters swept through the Hall.</p><p>\"The vampaneze are using guns?\" Paris asked, shocked. The vampaneze were even stricter than vampires where weapons were involved. We could use boomerangs and spears, but most vampaneze wouldn't touch them.</p><p>\"The vampets aren't vampaneze,\" Mika grunted. \"There's no reason why a non-blooded vampet shouldn't use a gun. I don't think all their masters approve, but under orders from their Lord, they allow it.</p>","<p>\"But the vampets are a problem for another night,\" Mika continued. \"I only mention them now because it's relevant to how I found out about their Lord. A vampaneze would die screaming before betraying his clan, but the vampets aren't so hardened. I captured one a few months ago and squeezed some interesting details out of him. Foremost of which is - the Vampaneze Lord doesn't have a base. He's travelling the world with a small band of guards, moving among the various fighting units, keeping up morale.\"</p><p>The Generals received the news with great excitement - if the Vampaneze Lord was mobile and lightly protected, he was more vulnerable to attack.</p><p>\"Did this vampet know where the Vampaneze Lord was?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"No,\" Mika said. \"He'd seen him, but that had been more than a year ago. Only those who accompany him know of his travel patterns.\"</p><p>\"What else did he tell you?\" Paris enquired.</p><p>\"That their Lord still hasn't been blooded. And that despite his efforts, morale is low. Vampaneze losses are high, and many don't believe they can win the war. There has been talk of a peace treaty - even outright surrender.\"</p><p>Loud cheering broke out. Some Generals were so elated by Mika's words that a group swept forward, picked him up, and carried him from the Hall. They could be heard singing and shouting as they headed for the crates of ale and wine stored below. The other, more sober-headed Generals looked to Paris for guidance.</p><p>\"Go on,\" the elderly Prince smiled. \"It would be impolite to let Mika and his over-eager companions drink alone.\"</p><p>The remaining Generals applauded the announcement and hurried away, leaving only a few Hall attendants, myself, Mr. Crepsley and Paris behind.</p><p>\"This is foolish,\" Mr. Crepsley grumbled. \"If the vampaneze are truly considering surrender, we should push hard after them, not waste time-\"</p><p>\"Larten,\" Paris interrupted. \"Follow the others, find the largest barrel of ale you can, and get good and steaming drunk.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley stared at the Prince, his mouth wide open. \"Paris!\" he gasped.</p><p>\"You have been caged in here too long,\" Paris said. \"Go and unwind, and do not return without a hangover.\"</p><p>\"But-\" Mr. Crepsley began.</p><p>\"That is an order, Larten,\" Paris growled.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley looked as though he'd swallowed a live eel, but he was never one to disobey an order from a superior, so he clicked his heels together, muttered, \"Aye, Sire,\" and stormed off to the store-rooms in a huff.</p><p>\"I've never seen Mr. Crepsley with a hangover,\" I laughed. \"What's he like?\"</p><p>\"Like a... what do the humans say? A gorilla with a sore head?\" Paris coughed into a fist - he'd been coughing a lot lately - then smiled. \"But it will do him good. Larten takes life too seriously sometimes.\"</p><p>\"What about you?\" I asked. \"Do you want to go?\"</p><p>Paris pulled a sour face. \"A mug of ale would prove the end of me. I shall take advantage of the break by lying in my coffin at the back of the Hall and getting a full day's sleep.\"</p><p>\"Are you sure? I can stay if you want.\"</p><p>\"No. Go and enjoy yourself. I will be fine.\"</p><p>\"OK.\" I hopped off my throne and made for the door.</p><p>\"Darren,\" Paris called me back. \"An excessive amount of alcohol is as bad for the young as for the old. If you are wise, you will drink in moderation.\"</p><p>\"Remember what you told me about wisdom a few years ago, Paris?\" I replied.</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"You said the only way to get wise was to get experienced.\" Winking, I rushed out of the Hall and was soon sharing a barrel of ale with a grumpy, orange-haired vampire. Mr. Crepsley gradually cheered up as the night progressed, and was singing loudly by the time he reeled back to his coffin late the following morning.</p><p>Chapter FIVE</p><p>I COULDN'T understand why there were two moons in the sky when I awoke, or why they were green. Groaning, I rubbed the back of a hand over my eyes, then looked again. I realized I was lying on the floor, staring up at the green eyes of a chuckling Harkat Mulds. \"Have fun last night?\" he asked.</p><p>\"I've been poisoned,\" I moaned, rolling over on to my stomach, feeling as though I was on the deck of a ship during a fierce storm.</p><p>\"You won't be wanting boar guts and... bat broth then?\"</p><p>\"Don't!\" I winced, weak at the very thought of food.</p><p>\"You and the others must have drained... half the mountain's supply of ale last night,\" Harkat remarked, helping me to my feet.</p><p>\"Is there an earthquake?\" I asked as he let go of me.</p><p>\"No,\" he said, puzzled.</p><p>\"Then why's the floor shaking?\"</p><p>He laughed and steered me to my hammock. I'd been sleeping inside the door of our cell. I had vague memories of falling off the hammock every time I tried to get on. \"I'll just sit on the floor a while,\" I said.</p><p>\"As you wish,\" Harkat chortled. \"Would you like some ale?\"</p><p>\"Go away or I'll hit you,\" I growled.</p><p>\"Is ale no longer to your liking?\"</p><p>\"No!\"</p><p>\"That's funny. You were singing about how much you... loved it earlier. 'Ale, ale, I drink like a whale, I am the... Prince, the Prince of ale'.\"</p><p>\"I could have you tortured,\" I warned him.</p><p>\"Never mind,\" Harkat said. \"The whole clan went crazy... last night. It takes a lot to get a vampire drunk, but... most managed. I've seen some wandering the tunnels, looking lik-\"</p><p>\"Please,\" I begged, \"don't describe them.\" Harkat laughed again, pulled me to my feet and led me out of the cell, into the maze of tunnels. \"Where are we going?\" I asked.</p><p>\"The Hall of Perta Vin Grahl. I asked Seba about cures... for hangovers - I had a feeling you'd have one - and he said... a shower usually did the trick.\"</p><p>\"No!\" I moaned. \"Not the showers! Have mercy!\"</p><p>Harkat took no notice of my pleas, and soon he was shoving me under the icy cold waters of the internal waterfalls in the Hall of Perta Vin Grahl. I thought my head was going to explode when the water first struck, but after a few minutes the worst of my headache had passed and my stomach had settled. By the time I was towelling myself dry, I felt a hundred times better.</p><p>We passed a green-faced Mr. Crepsley on our way back to our cell. I bid him a good evening, but he only snarled in reply.</p>","<p>\"I'll never understand the appeal of... alcohol,\" Harkat said as I was dressing.</p><p>\"Haven't you ever got drunk?\" I replied.</p><p>\"Perhaps in my past life, but not since... becoming a Little Person. I don't have taste buds, and alcohol doesn't... affect me.\"</p><p>\"Lucky you,\" I muttered sourly.</p><p>Once I'd dressed, we strolled up to the Hall of Princes to see if Paris needed me, but it was largely deserted and Paris was still in his coffin.</p><p>\"Let's go on a tour of the tunnels... beneath the Halls,\" Harkat suggested. We'd done a lot of exploring when we first came to the mountain, but it had been two or three years since we'd last gone off on an adventure.</p><p>\"Don't you have work to do?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Yes, but...\" He frowned. It took a while to get used to Harkat's expressions - it was hard to know whether someone without eyelids and a nose was frowning or grinning - but I'd learnt to read them. \"It will hold. I feel strange. I need to be on the move.\"</p><p>\"OK,\" I said. \"Let's go walkabout.\"</p><p>We started in the Hall of Corza Jarn, where trainee Generals were taught how to fight. I'd spent many hours here, mastering the use of swords, knives, axes and spears. Most of the weapons were designed for adults, and were too large and cumbersome for me to master, but I'd picked up the basics.</p><p>The highest ranking tutor was a blind vampire called Vanez Blane. He'd been my Trials Master during both my Trials of Initiation. He'd lost his left eye in a fight with a lion many decades before, and lost the second six years ago in a fight with the vampaneze.</p><p>Vanez was wrestling with three young Generals. Though he was blind, he'd lost none of his sharpness, and the trio ended up flat on their backs in short order at the hands of the ginger-haired games master. \"You'll have to learn to do better than that,\" he told them. Then, with his back to us, he said, \"Hello, Darren. Greetings, Harkat Mulds.\"</p><p>\"Hi, Vanez,\" we replied, not surprised that he knew who we were - vampires have very keen senses of smell and hearing.</p><p>\"I heard you singing last night, Darren,\" Vanez said, leaving his three students to recover and regroup.</p><p>\"No!\" I gasped, crestfallen. I'd thought Harkat was joking about that.</p><p>\"Very enlightening,\" Vanez smiled.</p><p>\"I didn't!\" I groaned. \"Tell me I didn't!\"</p><p>Vanez's smile spread. \"I shouldn't worry. Plenty of others made asses of themselves too.\"</p><p>\"Ale should be banned,\" I growled.</p><p>\"Nothing wrong with ale,\" Vanez disagreed. \"It's the ale- drinkers who need to be controlled.\"</p><p>We told Vanez we were going on a tour of the lower tunnels and asked if he'd like to tag along. \"Not much point,\" he said. \"I can't see anything. Besides...\" Lowering his voice, he told us the three Generals he was training were due to be sent into action soon. \"Between ourselves, they're as poor a trio as I've ever passed fit for duty,\" he sighed. Many vampires were being rushed into the field, to replace casualties in the War of the Scars. It was a contentious point among the clan - it usually took a minimum of twenty years to be declared a General of good standing - but Paris said that desperate times called for desperate measures.</p><p>Leaving Vanez, we made for the store-rooms to see Mr. Crepsley's old mentor, Seba Nile. At seven hundred, Seba was the second oldest vampire. He dressed in red like Mr. Crepsley, and spoke in the same precise way. He was wrinkled and shrunken with age, and limped badly - like Harkat - from a wound to his left leg gained in the same fight that had claimed Vanez's eye.</p><p>Seba was delighted to see us. When he heard we were going exploring, he insisted on coming with us. \"There is something I wish to show you,\" he said.</p><p>As we left the Halls and entered the vast warren of lower connecting tunnels, I scratched my bald head with my fingernails.</p><p>\"Ticks?\" Seba asked.</p><p>\"No,\" I said. \"My head's been itching like mad lately. My arms and legs too, and my armpits. I think I have an allergy.\"</p><p>\"Allergies are rare among vampires,\" Seba said. \"Let me examine you.\" Luminous lichen grew along many of the walls and he was able to study me by the light of a thick patch. \"Hmmm.\" He smiled briefly, then released me.</p><p>\"What is it?\" I asked.</p><p>\"You are coming of age, Master Shan.\"</p><p>\"What's that got to do with itching?\"</p><p>\"You will find out,\" he said mysteriously.</p><p>Seba kept stopping at webs to check on spiders. The old quartermaster was uncommonly fond of the eight-legged predators. He didn't keep them as pets, but he spent a lot of time studying their habits and patterns. He was able to communicate with them using his thoughts. Mr. Crepsley could too, and so could I.</p><p>\"Ah!\" he said eventually, stopping at a large cobweb. \"Here we are.\" Putting his lips together, he whistled softly, and moments later a big grey spider with curious green spots scuttled down the cobweb and on to Seba's upturned hand.</p><p>\"Where did that come from?\" I asked, stepping forward for a closer look. It was larger than the normal mountain spiders, and different in colour.</p><p>\"Do you like it?\" Seba asked. \"I call them Ba'Shan's spiders. I hope you do not object - the name seemed appropriate.\"</p><p>\"Ba'Shan's spiders?\" I repeated. \"Why would-\"</p><p>I stopped. Fourteen years ago, I'd stolen a poisonous spider from Mr. Crepsley - Madam Octa. Eight years later, I'd released her - on Seba's advice - to make a new home with the mountain spiders. Seba said she wouldn't be able to mate with the others. I hadn't seen her since I set her free, and had almost forgotten about her. But now the memory snapped into place, and I knew where this new spider had come from.</p><p>\"It's one of Madam Octa's, isn't it?\" I groaned.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Seba said. \"She mated with Ba'Halen's spiders. I noticed this new strain three years ago, although it is only this last year that they have multiplied. They are taking over. I think they will become the dominant mountain spider, perhaps within ten or fifteen years.\"</p><p>\"Seba!\" I snapped. \"I only released Madam Octa because you told me she couldn't have offspring. Are they poisonous?\"</p><p>The quartermaster shrugged. \"Yes, but not as deadly as their mother. If four or five attacked together, they could kill, but not one by itself.\"</p>","<p>\"What if they go on a rampage?\" I yelled.</p><p>\"They will not,\" Seba said stiffly.</p><p>\"How do you know?\"</p><p>\"I have asked them not to. They are incredibly intelligent, like Madam Octa. They have almost the same mental abilities as rats. I am thinking of training them.\"</p><p>\"To do what?\" I laughed.</p><p>\"Fight,\" he said darkly. \"Imagine if we could send armies of trained spiders out into the world, with orders to find vampaneze and kill them.\"</p><p>I turned appealingly to Harkat. \"Tell him he's crazy. Make him see sense.\"</p><p>Harkat smiled. \"It sounds like a good idea... to me,\" he said.</p><p>\"Ridiculous!\" I snorted. \"I'll tell Mika. He hates spiders. He'll send troops down here to stamp them out.\"</p><p>\"Please do not,\" Seba said quietly. \"Even if they cannot be trained, I enjoy watching them develop. Please do not rid me of one of my few remaining pleasures.\"</p><p>I sighed and cast my eyes to the ceiling. \"OK. I won't tell Mika.\"</p><p>\"Nor the others,\" he pressed. \"I would be highly unpopular if word leaked.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\"</p><p>Seba cleared his throat guiltily. \"The ticks,\" he muttered. \"The new spiders have been feeding on ticks, so they have moved upwards to escape.\"</p><p>\"Oh,\" I said, thinking of all the vampires who'd had to cut their hair and beards and shave under their arms because of the deluge of ticks. I grinned.</p><p>\"Eventually the spiders will pursue the ticks to the top of the mountain and the epidemic will pass,\" Seba continued, \"but until then I would rather nobody knew what was causing it.\"</p><p>I laughed. \"You'd be strung up if this got out!\"</p><p>\"I know,\" he grimaced.</p><p>I promised to keep word of the spiders to myself. Then Seba headed back for the Halls - the short trip had tired him - and Harkat and me continued down the tunnels. The further we progressed, the quieter Harkat got. He seemed uneasy, but when I asked him what was wrong, he said he didn't know.</p><p>Eventually we found a tunnel which led outside. We followed it to where it opened on to the steep mountain face, and sat staring up at the evening sky. It had been months since I'd stuck my head out in the open, and more than two years since I'd slept outdoors. The air tasted fresh and welcome, but strange.</p><p>\"It's cold,\" I noted, rubbing my hands up and down my bare arms.</p><p>\"Is it?\" Harkat asked. His dead grey skin only registered extreme degrees of heat or cold.</p><p>\"It must be late autumn or early winter.\" It was hard keeping track of the seasons when you lived inside a mountain.</p><p>Harkat wasn't listening. He was scanning the forests and valleys below, as if he expected to find someone there.</p><p>I walked a short bit down the mountain. Harkat followed, then overtook me and picked up speed. \"Careful,\" I called, but he paid no attention. Soon he was running, and I was left behind, wondering what he was playing at. \"Harkat!\" I yelled. \"You'll trip and crack your skull if you-\"</p><p>I stopped. He hadn't heard a word. Cursing, I slipped off my shoes, flexed my toes, then started after him. I tried to control my speed, but that wasn't an option on such a steep decline, and soon I was hurtling down the mountain, sending pebbles and dust scattering, yelling at the top of my lungs with excitement and terror.</p><p>Somehow we kept on our feet and reached the bottom of the mountain intact. Harkat kept running until he came to a small circle of trees, where he finally stopped and stood as though frozen. I jogged after him and came to a halt. \"What... was that... about?\" I gasped.</p><p>Raising his left hand, Harkat pointed towards the trees.</p><p>\"What?\" I asked, seeing nothing but trunks, branches and leaves.</p><p>\"He's coming,\" Harkat hissed.</p><p>\"Who?\"</p><p>\"The dragon master.\"</p><p>I stared at Harkat oddly. He looked as though he was awake, but perhaps he'd dozed off and was sleepwalking. \"I think we should get you back inside,\" I said, taking his outstretched arm. \"We'll find a fire and-\"</p><p>\"Hello, boys!\" somebody yelled from within the circle of trees. \"Are you the welcoming committee?\"</p><p>Letting go of Harkat's arm, I stood beside him - now as stiff as he was - and stared again into the cluster of trees. I thought I recognized that voice - though I hoped I was wrong!</p><p>Moments later, three figures emerged from the gloom. Two were Little People, who looked almost exactly like Harkat, except they had their hoods up and moved with a stiffness which Harkat had worked out of his system during his years among the vampires. The third was a small, smiling, white-haired man, who struck more fear in me than a band of marauding vampaneze.</p><p>Mr. Tiny!</p><p>After more than six hundred years, Desmond Tiny had returned to Vampire Mountain, and I knew as he strode towards us, beaming like a rat-catcher in league with the Pied Piper of Hamlin, that his reappearance heralded nothing but trouble.</p><p>Chapter SIX</p><p>MR. TINY paused briefly when he reached us. The short, plump man was wearing a shabby yellow suit - a thin jacket, no overcoat - with childish-looking green Wellington boots and a chunky pair of glasses. The heart-shaped watch he always carried hung by a chain from the front of his jacket. Some said Mr. Tiny was an agent of fate - his first name was Desmond, and if you shortened it and put the two names together, you got Mr. Destiny.</p><p>\"You've grown, young Shan,\" he said, running an eye over me. \"And you, Harkat...\" He smiled at the Little Person, whose green eyes seemed wider and rounder than ever. \"You have changed beyond recognition. Wearing your hood down, working for vampires - and talking!\"</p><p>\"You knew... I could talk,\" Harkat muttered, slipping back into his old broken speech habits. \"You always... knew.\"</p><p>Mr. Tiny nodded, then started forward. \"Enough of the chit-chat, boys. I have work to do and I must be quick. Time is precious. A volcano's due to erupt on a small tropical island tomorrow. Everybody within a ten-kilometre radius will be roasted alive. I want to be there - it sounds like great fun.\"</p><p>He wasn't joking. That's why everyone feared him - he took pleasure in tragedies which left anyone halfway human shaken to their very core.</p><p>We followed Mr. Tiny up the mountain, trailed by the two Little People. Harkat looked back often at his 'brothers'. I think he was communicating with them - the Little People can read each others thoughts - but he said nothing to me about it.</p>","<p>Mr. Tiny entered the mountain by a different tunnel to the one we'd used. It was a tunnel I'd never been in, higher, wider and drier than most. There were no twists or side tunnels leading off it. It rose straight and steady up the spine of the mountain. Mr. Tiny spotted me staring at the walls of the unfamiliar tunnel. \"This is one of my short cuts,\" he said. \"I've short cuts all over the world, in places you wouldn't dream of. Saves time.\"</p><p>As we progressed, we passed groups of very pale-skinned humans in rags, lining the sides of the tunnel, bowing low to Mr. Tiny. These were the Guardians of the Blood, people who lived within Vampire Mountain and donated their blood to the vampires. In return, they were allowed to extract a vampire's internal organs and brain when he died - which they ate at special ceremonies!</p><p>I felt nervous walking past the ranks of Guardians - I'd never seen so many of them gathered together before - but Mr. Tiny only smiled and waved at them, and didn't stop to exchange any words.</p><p>Within a quarter of an hour we were at the gate which opened on to the Halls of Vampire Mountain. The guard on duty swung the door wide open when we knocked but stopped when he saw Mr. Tiny and half closed it again. \"Who are you?\" he snapped defensively, hand snaking to the sword on his belt.</p><p>\"You know who I am, Perlat Cheil,\" Mr. Tiny said, brushing past the startled guard.</p><p>\"How do you know my-?\" Perlat Cheil began, then stopped and gazed after the departing figure. He was trembling and his hand had fallen away from his sword. \"Is that who I think it is?\" he asked as I passed with Harkat and the Little People.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said simply.</p><p>\"Charna's guts!\" he gasped, and made the death's touch sign by pressing the middle finger of his right hand to his forehead, and the two fingers next to that over his eyelids. It was a sign vampires made when they thought death was close.</p><p>Through the tunnels we marched, silencing conversations and causing jaws to drop. Even those who'd never met Mr. Tiny recognized him, stopped what they were doing and fell in behind us, following wordlessly, as though trailing a hearse.</p><p>There was only one tunnel leading to the Hall of Princes - I'd found another six years ago, but that had since been blocked off - and it was protected by the Mountain's finest guards. They were supposed to stop and search anyone seeking entry to the Hall, but when Mr. Tiny approached, they gawped at him, lowered their weapons, then let him - and the rest of the procession - pass unobstructed.</p><p>Mr. Tiny finally stopped at the doors of the Hall and glanced at the domed building which he'd built six centuries earlier. \"It's stood the test of time quite well, hasn't it?\" he remarked to no one in particular. Then, laying a hand on the doors, he opened them and entered. Only Princes were supposed to be able to open the doors, but it didn't surprise me that Mr. Tiny had the power to control them too.</p><p>Mika and Paris were within the Hall, discussing the war with a gaggle of Generals. There were a lot of sore heads and bleary eyes, but everyone snapped to attention when they saw Mr. Tiny striding in.</p><p>\"By the teeth of the gods!\" Paris gasped, his face whitening. He cringed as Mr. Tiny set foot on the platform of thrones, then drew himself straight and forced a tight smile. \"Desmond,\" he said, \"it is good to see you.\"</p><p>\"You too, Paris,\" Mr. Tiny responded.</p><p>\"To what do we owe this unexpected pleasure?\" Paris enquired with strained politeness.</p><p>\"Wait a minute and I'll tell you,\" Mr. Tiny replied, then plopped himself down on a throne - mine! - crossed his legs and made himself comfortable. \"Get the gang in,\" he said, crooking a finger at Mika. \"I've something to say and it's for everybody's ears.\"</p><p>Within a few minutes, almost every vampire in the mountain had crowded into the Hall of Princes, and stood nervously by the walls - as far away from Mr. Tiny as possible - waiting for the mysterious visitor to speak.</p><p>Mr. Tiny had been checking his nails and rubbing them up and down the front of his jacket. The Little People were standing behind the throne. Harkat stood to their left, looking uncertain. I sensed he didn't know whether to stand with his brothers-of-nature or with his brothers-of-choice - the vampires.</p><p>\"All present and correct?\" Mr. Tiny asked. He got to his feet and waddled to the front of the platform. \"Then I'll come straight to the point. The Lord of the Vampaneze has been blooded.\" He paused, anticipating gasps, groans and cries of terror. But we all just stared at him, too shocked to react. \"Six hundred years ago,\" he continued, \"I told your forebears that the Vampaneze Lord would lead the vampaneze into a war against you and wipe you out. That was a truth - but not the truth. The future is both open and closed. There's only one 'will be' but there are often hundreds of 'can be's'. Which means the Vampaneze Lord and his followers can be defeated.\"</p><p>Breath caught in every vampires throat and you could feel hope forming in the air around us, like a cloud.</p><p>\"The Vampaneze Lord is only a half-vampaneze at the moment,\" Mr. Tiny said. \"If you find and kill him before he's fully blooded, victory will be yours.\"</p><p>At that, a huge roar went up, and suddenly vampires were clapping each other on the back and cheering. A few didn't join in the hooting and hollering. Those with first-hand knowledge of Mr. Tiny - myself, Paris, Mr. Crepsley - sensed he hadn't finished, and guessed there must be a catch. Mr. Tiny wasn't the kind to smile broadly when delivering good news. He only grinned like that when he knew there was going to be suffering and misery.</p><p>When the wave of excitement had died down, Mr. Tiny raised his right hand. He clutched his heart-shaped watch with his left hand. The watch glowed a dark red colour, and suddenly his right hand glowed as well. All eyes settled on the five crimson fingers and the Hall went eerily quiet.</p><p>\"When the Vampaneze Lord was discovered seven years ago,\" Mr. Tiny said, his face illuminated by the glow of his fingers, \"I studied the strings connecting the present to the future, and saw that there were five chances to avert the course of destiny. One of those has already come and gone.\"</p><p>The red glow faded from his thumb, which he tucked down into his palm. \"That chance was Kurda Smahlt,\" he said. Kurda was the vampire who led the vampaneze against us, in a bid to seize control of the Stone of Blood. \"If Kurda had succeeded, most vampires would have been absorbed by the vampaneze and the War of the Scars - as you've termed it - would have been averted.\"</p>","<p>\"But you killed him, destroying what was probably your best hope of survival in the process.\" He shook his head and tutted. \"That was silly.\"</p><p>\"Kurda Smahlt was a traitor,\" Mika growled. \"Nothing good comes of treachery. I'd rather die honourably than owe my life to a turncoat.\"</p><p>\"More fool you,\" Mr. Tiny chortled, then wiggled his glowing little finger. \"This represents your last chance, if all others fail. It will not fall for some time yet - if at all - so we shall ignore it.\" He tucked the glowing finger down, leaving the three middle fingers standing.</p><p>\"Which brings us to my reason for coming. If I left you to your own devices, these chances would slip by unnoticed. You'd carry on as you have been, the windows of opportunity would pass, and before you knew it...\" He made a soft popping sound.</p><p>\"Within the next twelve months,\" he said softly but clearly, \"there may be three encounters between certain vampires and the Vampaneze Lord - assuming you heed my advice. Three times he will be at your mercy. If you seize one of these chances and kill him, the war will be yours. If you fail, there'll be one final, all-deciding confrontation, upon which the fate of every living vampire will hang.\" He paused teasingly. \"To be honest, I hope it goes down to the wire - I love big, dramatic conclusions!\"</p><p>He turned his back on the Hall and one of his Little People handed him a flask, from which he drank deeply. Furious whispers and conversations swept through the assembled vampires while he was drinking, and when he next faced the crowd, Paris Skyle was waiting. \"You have been very generous with your information, Desmond,\" he said. \"On behalf of all here, I thank you.\"</p><p>\"Don't mention it,\" Mr. Tiny said. His fingers had stopped glowing, he'd let go of his watch, and his hands now rested in his lap.</p><p>\"Will you extend your generosity and tell us which vampires are destined to encounter the Vampaneze Lord?\" Paris asked.</p><p>\"I will,\" Mr. Tiny said smugly. \"But let me make one thing clear - the encounters will only occur if the vampires choose to hunt the Lord of the Vampaneze. The three I name don't have to accept the challenge of hunting him down, or take responsibility for the future of the vampire clan. But if they don't, you're doomed, for in these three alone lies the ability to change that which is destined to be.\"</p><p>He slowly looked around the Hall, meeting the eyes of every vampire present, searching for signs of weakness and fear. Not one of us looked away or wilted in the face of such a dire charge. \"Very well,\" he grunted. \"One of the hunters is absent, so I'll not name him. If the other two head for the cave of Lady Evanna, they'll probably run into him along the way. If not, his chance to play an active part in the future will pass, and it will boil down to that lone pair.\"</p><p>\"And they are...?\" Paris asked tensely.</p><p>Mr. Tiny glanced over at me, and with a horrible sinking feeling in my gut, I guessed what was coming next. \"The hunters must be Larten Crepsley and his assistant, Darren Shan,\" Mr. Tiny said simply, and as all eyes in the Hall turned to seek us out, I had the sense of invisible tumblers clicking into place, and knew my years of quiet security inside Vampire Mountain had come to an end.</p><p>Chapter SEVEN</p><p>THE POSSIBILITY of refusing the challenge never entered my thoughts. Six years of living among vampires had filled me with their values and beliefs. Any vampire would lay down his life for the good of the clan. Of course, this wasn't as simple as giving one's life - I had a mission to fulfill, and if I failed, all would suffer - but the principle was the same. I'd been chosen, and a vampire who's been chosen does not say 'no'.</p><p>There was a short debate, in which Paris told Mr. Crepsley and me that this was not official duty and we didn't have to agree to represent the clan - no shame would befall us if we refused to co-operate with Mr. Tiny. At the end of the debate, Mr. Crepsley stepped forward, red cloak snapping behind him like wings, and said, \"I relish the chance to hunt down the Vampaneze Lord.\"</p><p>I stepped up after him, sorry I wasn't wearing my impressive blue cloak, and said in what I hoped was a brave tone, \"Me too.\"</p><p>\"The boy knows how to keep it short,\" Mr. Tiny murmured, winking at Harkat.</p><p>\"What about the rest of us?\" Mika asked. \"I've spent five years hunting for that accursed Lord. I wish to accompany them.\"</p><p>\"Aye! Me too!\" a General in the crowd shouted, and soon everyone was bellowing at Mr. Tiny, seeking permission to join us in the hunt.</p><p>Mr. Tiny shook his head. \"Three hunters must seek - no more, no less. Non-vampires may assist them, but if any of their kinsmen tag along, they shall fail.\"</p><p>Angry mutters greeted that statement.</p><p>\"Why should we believe you?\" Mika asked. \"Surely ten stand a better chance than three, and twenty more than ten, and thirty-\"</p><p>Mr. Tiny clicked his fingers. There was a sharp, snapping sound and dust fell from overhead. Looking up, I saw long jagged cracks appear in the ceiling of the Hall of Princes. Other vampires saw them too and cried out, alarmed.</p><p>\"Would you, who has not seen three centuries, dare to tell me, who measures time in continental drifts, about the mechanisms of fate?\" Mr. Tiny asked menacingly. He clicked his fingers again and the cracks spread. Chunks of the ceiling crumbled inwards. \"A thousand vampaneze couldn't chip the walls of this Hall, yet I, by clicking my fingers, can bring it tumbling down.\" He lifted his fingers to click them again.</p><p>\"No!\" Mika shouted. \"I apologize! I didn't mean to offend you!\"</p><p>Mr. Tiny lowered his hand. \"Think of this before crossing me again, Mika Ver Leth,\" he growled, then nodded at the Little People he'd brought with him, who headed for the doors of the Hall. \"They'll patch the roof up before we leave,\" Mr. Tiny said. \"But next time you anger me, I'll reduce this Hall to rubble, leaving you and your precious Stone of Blood to the whim of the vampaneze.\"</p><p>Blowing dust off his heart-shaped watch, Mr. Tiny beamed around the Hall again. \"I take it we're decided - three it shall be?\"</p><p>\"Three,\" Paris agreed.</p><p>\"Three,\" Mika muttered bleakly.</p><p>\"As I said, non-vampires may - indeed, must - play a part, but for the next year no vampire should seek out any of the hunters, unless for reasons which have nothing to do with the search for the Vampaneze Lord. Alone they must stand and alone they must succeed or fail.\"</p>","<p>With that, he brought the meeting to a close. Dismissing Paris and Mika with an arrogant wave of his hand, he beckoned Mr. Crepsley and me forward, and grinned at us as he lay back on my throne. He kicked off one of his wellies while he was talking. He wasn't wearing socks, and I was shocked to see he had no toes - his feet were webbed at the ends, with six tiny claws jutting out like a cat's.</p><p>\"Frightened, Master Shan?\" he asked, eyes twinkling mischievously.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said, \"but I'm proud to be able to help.\"</p><p>\"What if you aren't any help?\" he jeered. \"What if you fail and damn the vampires to extinction?\"</p><p>I shrugged. \"What comes, we take,\" I said, echoing a saying which was common among the creatures of the night.</p><p>Mr. Tiny's smile faded. \"I preferred you when you were less clever,\" he grumbled, then looked to Mr. Crepsley. \"What about you? Scared by the weight of your responsibilities?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Mr. Crepsley answered.</p><p>\"Think you might break beneath it?\"</p><p>\"I might,\" Mr. Crepsley said evenly.</p><p>Mr. Tiny pulled a face. \"You two are no fun. It's impossible to get a rise out of you. Harkat!\" he bellowed. Harkat approached automatically. \"What do you think of this? Does the fate of the vampires bother you?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Harkat replied. \"It does.\"</p><p>\"You care for them?\" Harkat nodded. \"Hmmm.\" Mr. Tiny rubbed his watch, which glowed briefly, then touched the left side of Harkat's head. Harkat gasped and fell to his knees. \"You've been having nightmares,\" Mr. Tiny noted, fingers still at Harkat's temple.</p><p>\"Yes!\" Harkat groaned.</p><p>\"You want them to stop?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>Mr. Tiny let go of Harkat, who cried out, then gritted his sharp teeth and stood up straight. Small green tears of pain trickled from the corners of his eyes.</p><p>\"It's time for you to learn the truth about yourself,\" Mr. Tiny said. \"If you come with me, I'll reveal it and the nightmares will stop. If you don't, they'll continue and worsen, and within a year you'll be a screaming wreck.\"</p><p>Harkat trembled at that, but didn't rush to Mr. Tiny's side. \"If I wait,\" he said, \"will I have... another chance to learn... the truth?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Mr. Tiny said, \"but you'll suffer much in the meantime, and I can't guarantee your safety. If you die before learning who you really are, your soul will be lost forever.\"</p><p>Harkat frowned uncertainly. \"I have a feeling,\" he mumbled. \"Something whispers to me-\" he touched the left side of his chest \"- here. I feel that I should go with Darren... and Larten.\"</p><p>\"If you do, it will improve their chances of defeating the Vampaneze Lord,\" Mr. Tiny said. \"Your participation isn't instrumental, but it could be important.\"</p><p>\"Harkat,\" I said softly, \"you don't owe us. You've already saved my life twice. Go with Mr. Tiny and learn the truth about yourself.\"</p><p>Harkat frowned. \"I think that if I... leave you to learn the truth, the person I was... won't like what I've done.\" The Little Person spent a few more difficult seconds brooding about it, then squared up to Mr. Tiny. \"I'll go with them. Right or wrong, I feel my place is... with the vampires. All else must wait.\"</p><p>\"So be it,\" Mr. Tiny sniffed. \"If you survive, our paths will cross again. If not...\" His smile was withering.</p><p>\"What of our search?\" Mr. Crepsley asked. \"You mentioned Lady Evanna. Do we start with her?\"</p><p>\"If you wish,\" Mr. Tiny said. \"I can't and won't direct you, but that's where I would start. After that, follow your heart. Forget about the quest and go where you feel you belong. Fate will direct you as it pleases.\"</p><p>That was the end of our conversation. Mr. Tiny slipped away without a farewell, taking his Little People (they'd completed their repair work while he was talking), no doubt anxious to make that fatal volcano of his the next day.</p><p>Vampire Mountain was in uproar that night. Mr. Tiny's visit and prophecy were debated and dissected at length. The vampires agreed that Mr. Crepsley and me had to leave on our own, to link up with the third hunter - whoever he might be - but were divided as to what the rest of them should do. Some thought that since the clan's future rested with three lone hunters, they should forget the war with the vampaneze, since it no longer seemed to serve any purpose. Most disagreed and said it would be crazy to stop fighting.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley led Harkat and me from the Hall shortly before dawn, leaving the arguing Princes and Generals behind, saying we needed to get a good day's rest. It was hard to sleep with Mr. Tiny's words echoing round my brain, but I managed to squeeze in a few hours.</p><p>We woke about three hours before sunset, ate a short meal and packed our meagre belongings (I took a spare set of clothes, some bottles of blood, and my diary). We said private goodbyes to Vanez and Seba - the old quartermaster was especially sad to see us go - then met Paris Skyle at the gate leading out of the Halls. He told us Mika was staying on to assist with the night-to-night running of the war. He looked very poorly as I shook his hand, and I had a feeling that he hadn't many years left - if our search kept us away from Vampire Mountain for a long period, this might be the last time I saw him.</p><p>\"I'll miss you, Paris,\" I said, hugging him roughly after we'd shaken hands.</p><p>\"I will miss you too, young Prince,\" he said, then squeezed me tight and hissed in my ear: \"Find and kill him, Darren. There is a cold chill in my bones, and it is not the chill of old age. Mr. Tiny has spoken the truth - if the Vampaneze Lord comes into his full powers, I am sure we all shall perish.\"</p><p>\"I'll find him,\" I vowed, locking gazes with the ancient Prince. \"And if the chance falls to me to kill him, my aim will be true.\"</p><p>\"Then may the luck of the vampires be with you,\" he said.</p><p>I joined Mr. Crepsley and Harkat. We saluted to those who'd gathered to see us off, then faced down the tunnels and set off. We moved quickly and surely, and within two hours had left the mountain and were jogging over open ground, beneath a clear night sky.</p><p>Our hunt for the Lord of the Vampaneze had begun!</p><p>Chapter EIGHT</p><p>IT WAS great to be back on the road. We might be walking into the heart of an inferno, and our companions would suffer immeasurably if we failed, but those were worries for the future. In those first few weeks all I could think about was how refreshing it was to stretch my legs and breathe clean air, not caged in with dozens of sweaty, smelly vampires.</p>","<p>I was in high spirits as we cut a path through the mountains by night. Harkat was very quiet and spent a lot of time mulling over what Mr. Tiny had said. Mr. Crepsley seemed as glum as ever, though I knew that underneath the gloomy facade he was as pleased to be out in the open as I was.</p><p>We struck a firm pace and kept to it, covering many kilometres over the course of each night, sleeping deeply by day beneath trees and bushes, or in caves. The cold was fierce when we set off, but as we wound our way down through the mountain range, the biting chill lessened. By the time we reached the lowlands we were as comfortable as a human would have been on a blustery autumn day.</p><p>We carried spare bottles of human blood, and fed on wild animals. It had been a long time since I hunted, and I was rusty to begin with, but I soon got back into the swing of it.</p><p>\"This is the life, isn't it?\" I noted one morning as we chewed on the roasted carcass of a deer. We didn't light a fire most days - we ate our meat raw - but it was nice to relax around a mound of blazing logs every once in a while.</p><p>\"It is,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed.</p><p>\"I wish we could go on like this forever.\"</p><p>The vampire smiled. \"You are not in a hurry to return to Vampire Mountain?\"</p><p>I pulled a face. \"Being a Prince is a great honour, but it's not much fun.\"</p><p>\"You have had a rough initiation,\" he said sympathetically. \"Were we not at war, there would have been time for adventure. Most Princes wander the world for decades before settling down to royal duty. Your timing was unfortunate.\"</p><p>\"Still, I can't complain,\" I said cheerfully. \"I'm free now.\"</p><p>Harkat stirred up the fire and edged closer towards us. He hadn't said a lot since leaving Vampire Mountain, but now he lowered his mask and spoke. \"I loved Vampire Mountain. It felt like home. I never felt so at ease before, even when I... was with the Cirque Du Freak. When this is over, if I have... the choice, I'll return.\"</p><p>\"There is vampire blood in you,\" Mr. Crepsley said. He was joking, but Harkat took the statement seriously.</p><p>\"There might be,\" he said. \"I've often wondered if I was a vampire in... my previous life. That might explain why I was sent to Vampire Mountain... and why I fitted in so well. It could also explain the stakes... in my dreams.\"</p><p>Harkat's dreams often involved stakes. The ground would give way in his nightmares and he'd fall into a pit of stakes, or be chased by shadow men who carried stakes and drove them through his heart.</p><p>\"Any fresh clues as to who you might have been?\" I asked. \"Did meeting Mr. Tiny jog your memory?\"</p><p>Harkat shook his chunky, neckless head. \"No further insights,\" he sighed.</p><p>\"Why did Mr. Tiny not tell you the truth about yourself if it was time for you to learn?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"I don't think it's as... simple as that,\" Harkat said. \"I have to earn the truth. It's part of the... deal we made.\"</p><p>\"Wouldn't it be weird if Harkat had been a vampire?\" I remarked. \"What if he'd been a Prince - would he still be able to open the doors of the Hall of Princes?\"</p><p>\"I don't think I was a Prince,\" Harkat chuckled, the corners of his wide mouth lifting in a gaping smile.</p><p>\"Hey,\" I said, \"if I can become a Prince, anyone can.\"</p><p>\"True,\" Mr. Crepsley muttered, then ducked swiftly as I tossed a leg of deer at him.</p><p>Once clear of the mountains, we headed south-east and soon reached the outskirts of civilization. It was strange to see electric lights, cars and planes again. I felt as though I'd been living in the past and had stepped out of a time machine.</p><p>\"It's so noisy,\" I commented one night as we passed through a busy town. We'd entered it to draw blood from humans, slicing them in their sleep with our nails, taking a small amount of blood, closing the cuts with Mr. Crepsley's healing spit, leaving them oblivious to the fact that they'd been fed upon. \"So much music and laughter and shouting.\" My ears were ringing from the noise.</p><p>\"Humans always chatter like monkeys,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"It is their way.\"</p><p>I used to object when he said things like that, but not any more. When I became Mr. Crepsley's assistant, I'd clung to the hope of returning to my old life. I'd dreamt of regaining my humanity and going home to my family and friends. No longer. My years in Vampire Mountain had rid me of my human desires. I was a creature of the night now - and content to be so.</p><p>The itching was getting worse. Before leaving town, I found a pharmacy and bought several anti-itching powders and lotions, which I rubbed into my flesh. The powders and lotions brought no relief. Nothing stopped the itching, and I scratched myself irritably as we journeyed to the cave of Lady Evanna.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley wouldn't say much about the woman we were going to meet, where she lived, whether she was a vampire or human, and why we were going to see her.</p><p>\"You should tell me these things,\" I grumbled one morning as we made camp. \"What if something happens to you? How would Harkat and me find her?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley stroked the long scar running down the left side of his face - after all our years together, I still didn't know how he got it - and nodded thoughtfully. \"You are right. I will draw a map before nightfall.\"</p><p>\"And tell us who she is?\"</p><p>He hesitated. \"That is harder to explain. It might be best coming from her own lips. Evanna tells different people different things. She might not object to you knowing the truth - but then again, she might.\"</p><p>\"Is she an inventor?\" I pressed. Mr. Crepsley owned a collection of pots and pans which folded up into tiny bundles, making them easier to carry. He'd told me that Evanna had made them.</p><p>\"She sometimes invents,\" he said. \"She is a woman of many talents. Much of her time is spent breeding frogs.\"</p><p>\"Excuse me?\" I blinked.</p><p>\"It is her hobby. Some people breed horses, dogs or cats. Evanna breeds frogs.\"</p><p>\"How can she breed frogs?\" I snorted sceptically.</p><p>\"You will find out.\" Then he leant forward and tapped my knee. \"Whatever you say, do not call her a witch.\"</p><p>\"Why would I call her a witch?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Because she is one - sort of.\"</p><p>\"We're going to meet a witch!\" Harkat snapped worriedly.</p><p>\"That troubles you?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p>","<p>\"Sometimes in my dreams... there's a witch. I've never seen her face - not clearly - and I'm not sure... if she's good or bad. There are times when I run to her for help, and times... when I run away, afraid.\"</p><p>\"You haven't mentioned that before,\" I said.</p><p>Harkat's smile was shaky. \"With all the dragons, stakes and shadow men... what's one little witch?\"</p><p>The mention of dragons reminded me of something he'd said when we met Mr. Tiny. He'd called him 'the dragon master'. I asked Harkat about this but he couldn't remember saying it. \"Although,\" he mused, \"I sometimes see Mr. Tiny in my dreams, riding the... backs of dragons. Once he tore the brain out of one and... tossed it at me. I reached to catch it but... woke before I could.\"</p><p>We thought about that image a long time. Vampires place a lot of importance on dreams. Many believe that dreams act as links to the past or future, and that much can be learnt from them. But Harkat's dreams didn't seem to have any bearing on reality, and in the end Mr. Crepsley and me dismissed them, rolled over and slept. Harkat didn't - he stayed awake, green eyes glowing faintly, putting off sleep as long as he could, avoiding the dragons, stakes, witches and other perils of his troubled nightmares.</p><p>Chapter NINE</p><p>ONE DUSK I awoke with a feeling of absolute comfort. As I stared up at a red, darkening sky, I tried putting my finger on why I felt so good. Then I realized - the itching had stopped. I lay still a few minutes, afraid it would return if I moved, but when I finally got to my feet, there wasn't the slightest prickling sensation. Grinning, I headed for a small pond we'd camped by, to wet my throat.</p><p>I lowered my face into the cool, clear water of the pond and drank deeply. As I was rising, I noticed an unfamiliar face in the reflecting surface of the water - a long-haired, bearded man. It was directly in front of me, which meant he must be standing right behind me - but I hadn't heard anyone approach.</p><p>Swivelling swiftly, my hand shot to the sword which I'd brought from Vampire Mountain. I had it halfway out of its scabbard before stopping, confused.</p><p>There was no one there.</p><p>I looked around for the shabby, bearded man, but he was nowhere to be seen. There were no nearby trees or rocks he could have ducked behind, and not even a vampire could have moved quickly enough to disappear so swiftly.</p><p>I turned back towards the pond and looked into the water again. There he was! As clear and hairy as before, scowling up at me.</p><p>I gave a yelp and jumped back from the water's edge. Was the bearded man in the pond? If so, how was he breathing?</p><p>Stepping forward, I locked gazes with the hairy man - he looked like a caveman - for the third time and smiled. He smiled back. \"Hello,\" I said. His lips moved when mine did, but silently. \"My name's Darren Shan.\" Again his lips moved in time with mine. I was getting annoyed - was he mocking me? - when realization struck - it was me!</p><p>I could see my eyes and the shape of my mouth now that I looked closely, and the small triangular scar just above my right eye, which had become as much a part of me as my nose or ears. It was my face, no doubt about that - but where had all the hair come from?</p><p>I felt around my chin and discovered a thick bushy beard. Running my right hand over my head - which should have been smooth - I was stunned to feel long, thick locks of hair. My thumb, which stuck out at an angle, caught in several of the strands, and I winced as I tugged it free, pulling some hair out with it.</p><p>What in Khledon Lurt's name had happened to me?</p><p>I checked further. Ripping off my T-shirt revealed a chest and stomach covered in hair. Huge balls of hair had also formed under my armpits and over my shoulders. I was hairy all over!</p><p>\"Charna's guts!\" I roared, then ran to wake my friends.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley and Harkat were breaking camp when I rushed up, panting and shouting. The vampire took one look at my hairy figure, whipped out a knife and roared at me to stop. Harkat stepped up beside him, a grim expression on his face. As I halted, gasping for breath, I saw they didn't recognize me. Raising my hands to show they were empty, I croaked, \"Don't... attack! It's... me!\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley's eyes widened. \"Darren!\"</p><p>\"It can't be,\" Harkat growled. \"This is an impostor.\"</p><p>\"No!\" I moaned. \"I woke up, went to the pond to drink, and found... found...\" I shook my hairy arms at them.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley stepped forward, sheathed his knife, and studied my face incredulously. Then he groaned. \"The purge!\" he muttered.</p><p>\"The what?\" I shouted.</p><p>\"Sit down, Darren,\" Mr. Crepsley said seriously. \"We have a lot of talking to do. Harkat - go fill our canteens and fix a new fire.\"</p><p>When Mr. Crepsley had gathered his thoughts, he explained to Harkat and me what was happening. \"You know that half-vampires become full-vampires when more vampire blood is pumped into them. What we have never discussed - since I did not anticipate it so soon - is the other way in which one's blood can turn.</p><p>\"Basically, if one remains a half-vampire for an extremely long period of time - the average is forty years - one's vampire cells eventually attack the human cells and convert them, resulting in full-vampirism. We call this the purge.\"</p><p>\"You mean I've become a full-vampire?\" I asked quietly, both intrigued and frightened by the notion. Intrigued because it would mean extra strength, the ability to flit and communicate telepathically. Frightened because it would also mean a total retreat from daylight and the world of humanity.</p><p>\"Not yet,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"The hair is simply the first stage. We shall shave it off presently, and though it will grow back, it will stop after a month or so. You will undergo other changes during that time - you will grow, and experience headaches and sharp bursts of energy - but these too will cease. At the end of the changes, your vampiric blood may have replaced your human blood entirely, but it probably will not, and you will return to normal - for a few months or a couple of years. But sometime within the next few years, your blood will turn completely. You have entered the final stages of half-vampirism. There is no turning back.\"</p><p>We spent most of the rest of the night discussing the purge. Mr. Crepsley said it was rare for a half-vampire to undergo the purge after less than twenty years, but it was probably linked to when I'd become a Vampire Prince - more vampiric blood had been added to my veins during the ceremony, and that must have speeded up the process.</p>","<p>I recalled Seba studying me in the tunnels of Vampire Mountain, and told Mr. Crepsley about it. \"He must have known about the purge,\" I said. \"Why didn't he warn me?\"</p><p>\"It was not his place,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"As your mentor, I am responsible for informing you. I am sure he would have told me about it, so that I could have sat down with you and explained it, but there was no time - Mr. Tiny arrived and we had to leave the Mountain.\"</p><p>\"You said Darren would grow during... the purge,\" Harkat said. \"How much?\"</p><p>\"There is no telling,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Potentially, he could mature to adulthood in the space of a few months - but that is unlikely. He shall age a few years, but probably no more.\"</p><p>\"You mean I'll finally hit my teens?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I would imagine so.\"</p><p>I thought about that for a while, then grinned. \"Cool!\"</p><p>But the purge was far from cool - it was a curse! Shaving off all the hair was bad enough - Mr. Crepsley used a long, sharp blade, which scraped my skin raw - but the changes my body was undergoing were much worse. Bones were lengthening and fusing. My nails and teeth grew - I had to bite my nails and grind my teeth together while I walked at night to keep them in shape - and my feet and hands got longer. Within weeks I was five centimetres taller, aching all over from growth pains.</p><p>My senses were in a state of disarray. Slight sounds were magnified - the snapping of a twig was like a house collapsing. The dullest of smells set my nose tingling. My sense of taste deserted me completely. Everything tasted like cardboard. I began to understand what life must be like for Harkat and made a resolution never to tease him about his lack of taste buds again.</p><p>Even dim lights were blinding to my ultra-sensitive eye. The moon was like a fierce spotlight in the sky, and if I opened my eyes during the day, I might as well have been sticking two fiery pins into them - the inside of my head would flare with a metallic pain.</p><p>\"Is this what sunlight is like for full-vampires?\" I asked Mr. Crepsley one day, as I shivered beneath a thick blanket, eyes shut tight against the painful rays of the sun.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he said. \"That is why we avoid even short periods of exposure to daylight. The pain of sunburn is not especially great - not for the first ten or fifteen minutes - but the glare of the sun is instantly unbearable.\"</p><p>I suffered with immense headaches during the purge, a result of my out-of-control senses. There were times when I thought my head was going to explode, and I'd weep helplessly from the pain.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley helped me fight the dizzying effects. He bound light strips of cloth across my eyes - I could still see pretty well - and stuffed balls of grass into my ears and up my nostrils. That was uncomfortable, and I felt ridiculous - Harkat's howls of laughter didn't help - but the headaches lessened.</p><p>Another side-effect was a fierce surge of energy. I felt as if I was operating on batteries. I had to run ahead of Mr. Crepsley and Harkat at night, then double back to meet them, just to tire myself out. I exercised like crazy every time we stopped - push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups - and usually woke long before Mr. Crepsley, unable to sleep more than a couple of hours at a time. I climbed trees and cliffs, and swam across rivers and lakes, all in an effort to use up my unnatural store of energy. I'd have wrestled an elephant if I'd found one!</p><p>Finally, after six weeks, the turmoil ceased. I stopped growing. I didn't have to shave any more (though the hair on my head remained - I was no longer bald!). I removed the cloth and grass balls, and my taste returned, although patchily to begin with.</p><p>I was about seven centimetres taller than I'd been when the purge hit me, and noticeably broader. The skin on my face had hardened, giving me a slightly older appearance - I looked like a fifteen- or sixteen-year-old now.</p><p>Most importantly - I was still a half-vampire. The purge hadn't eliminated my human blood cells. The downside of that was I'd have to undergo the discomfort of the purge again in the future. On the plus side I could continue to enjoy sunlight for the time being, before having to abandon it forever in favour of the night.</p><p>Although I was keen to become a full-vampire, I'd miss the daytime world. Once my blood turned, there was no going back. I accepted that, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous. This way, I had months - perhaps a year or two - to prepare myself for the change.</p><p>I'd outgrown my clothes and shoes, so I had to stock up at a small human outpost (we were leaving civilization behind again). In an army surplus shop, I chose gear similar to my old stuff, adding a couple of purple shirts to my blue ones, and a dark green pair of trousers. As I was paying for the clothes, a tall, lean man entered. He was wearing a brown shirt, black trousers and a baseball cap. \"I need supplies,\" he grunted at the man serving behind the counter, tossing a list at him.</p><p>\"You'll need a licence for the guns,\" the shopkeeper said, running an eye over the scrap of paper.</p><p>\"I've got one.\" The man was reaching into a shirt pocket when he caught sight of my hands and stiffened. I was holding my new clothes across my chest, and the scars on my fingertips - where I'd been blooded by Mr. Crepsley - were clear.</p><p>The man relaxed instantly and turned away - but I was sure he'd recognized the scars and knew what I was. Hurrying from the shop, I found Mr. Crepsley and Harkat on the edge of town and told them what had happened.</p><p>\"Was he nervous?\" Mr. Crepsley asked. \"Did he follow when you left?\"</p><p>\"No. He just went stiff when he saw the marks, then acted as though he hadn't seen them. But he knew what the marks meant - I'm certain of it.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley rubbed his scar thoughtfully. \"Humans who know the truth about vampire marks are uncommon, but some exist. In all probability he is an ordinary person who has simply heard tales of vampires and their fingertips.\"</p><p>\"But he might be a vampire hunter,\" I said quietly.</p><p>\"Vampire hunters are rare - but real.\" Mr. Crepsley thought it over, then decided. \"We will proceed as planned, but keep our eyes open, and you or Harkat will remain on watch by day. If an attack comes, we shall be ready.\" He smiled tightly and touched the handle of his knife. \"And waiting.\"</p><p>Chapter TEN</p><p>BY DAWN we knew we had a fight on our hands. We were being followed, not just by one person, but three or four. They'd picked up our trail a few kilometres outside the town and had been tracking us ever since. They moved with admirable stealth, and if we hadn't been anticipating trouble, we might not have known anything was amiss. But when a vampire is alert to danger, not even the most fleet-footed human can sneak up on him.</p>","<p>\"What's the plan?\" Harkat asked as we were making camp in the middle of a small forest, sheltered from the sun beneath the intertwining branches and leaves.</p><p>\"They will wait for full daylight to attack,\" Mr. Crepsley said, keeping his voice low. \"We will act as though all is normal and pretend to sleep. When they come, we deal with them.\"</p><p>\"Will you be OK in the sun?\" I asked. Though we were sheltered where we were, a battle might draw us out of the shade.</p><p>\"The rays will not harm me during the short time it will take to deal with this threat,\" Mr. Crepsley replied. \"And I will protect my eyes with cloth, as you did during your purge.\"</p><p>Making beds amid the moss and leaves on the ground, we wrapped ourselves in our cloaks and settled down. \"Of course, they might just be curious,\" Harkat muttered. \"They could simply want to see... what a real-life vampire looks like.\"</p><p>\"They move too keenly for that,\" Mr. Crepsley disagreed. \"They are here on business.\"</p><p>\"I just remembered,\" I hissed. \"The guy in the shop was buying guns!\"</p><p>\"Most vampire hunters come properly armed,\" Mr. Crepsley grunted. \"Gone are the nights when the fools toted only a hammer and wooden stake.\"</p><p>There was no more talk after that. We lay still, eyes closed (except for Harkat, who covered his lidless eyes with his cloak), breathing evenly, feigning sleep.</p><p>Seconds passed slowly, taking an age to become minutes, and an eternity to become hours. It had been six years since my last taste of vicious combat. My limbs felt unnaturally cold, and stiff, icy snakes of fear coiled and uncoiled inside the walls of my stomach. I kept flexing my fingers beneath the folds of my cloak, never far from my sword, ready to draw.</p><p>Shortly after midday - when the sun would be most harmful to a vampire - the humans moved in for the kill. There were three of them, spread out in a semicircle. At first I could only hear the rustling of leaves as they approached, and the occasional snap of a twig. But as they closed upon us, I became aware of their heavy breathing, the creak of their tense bones, the pacy, panicked pounding of their hearts.</p><p>They came to a standstill ten or twelve metres away, tucked behind trees, preparing themselves to attack. There was a long, nervous pause - then the sound of a gun being slowly cocked.</p><p>\"Now!\" Mr. Crepsley roared, springing to his feet, launching himself at the human nearest him.</p><p>While Mr. Crepsley closed in on his assailant at incredible speed, Harkat and me targeted the others. The one I'd set my sights on cursed loudly, stepped out from behind his tree, brought his rifle up and got a snap shot off. A bullet whizzed past, missing me by several centimetres. Before he could fire again, I was upon him.</p><p>I wrenched the rifle from the human's hands and tossed it away. A gun went off behind me, but there was no time to check on my friends. The man in front of me had already drawn a long hunting knife, so I quickly slid my sword out.</p><p>The man's eyes widened when he saw the sword - he'd painted the area around his eyes with red circles of what looked like blood - then narrowed. \"You're just a kid,\" he snarled, slashing at me with his knife.</p><p>\"No,\" I disagreed, stepping out of range of his knife, jabbing at him with my sword. \"I'm much more.\"</p><p>As the human slashed at me again, I brought my sword up and out in a smooth arcing slice, through the flesh, muscles and bones of his right hand, severing three of his fingers, disarming him in an instant.</p><p>The human cried out in agony and fell away from me. I took advantage of the moment to see how Mr. Crepsley and Harkat were faring. Mr. Crepsley had already despatched his human, and was striding towards Harkat, who was wrestling with his opponent. Harkat appeared to have the advantage of his foe, but Mr. Crepsley was moving into place to back him up should the battle take a turn for the worse.</p><p>Satisfied that all was going in our favour, I switched my attention back to the man on the ground, psyching myself up for the unpleasant task of making an end of him. To my surprise, I found him grinning horribly at me.</p><p>\"You should have taken my other hand too!\" he growled.</p><p>My eyes fixed on the man's left hand and my breath caught in my throat - he was clutching a hand grenade close to his chest!</p><p>\"Don't move!\" he shouted as I lurched towards him. He half-pressed down on the detonator with his thumb. \"If this goes off, it takes you with me!\"</p><p>\"Easy,\" I sighed, backing off slightly, gazing fearfully at the primed grenade.</p><p>\"I'll take it easy in hell,\" he chuckled sadistically. He'd shaved his head bald and there was a dark 'V' tattooed into either side of his skull, just above his ears. \"Now, tell your foul vampire partner and that grey-skinned monster to let my companion go, or I'll-\"</p><p>There was a sharp whistling sound from the trees to my left. Something struck the grenade and sent it flying from the humans hand. He yelled and grabbed for another grenade (he had a string of them strapped around his chest). There was a second whistling sound and a glinting, multi-pointed object buried itself in the middle of the man's head.</p><p>The man slumped backwards with a grunt, shook crazily, then lay still. I stared at him, bewildered, automatically bending closer for a clearer look. The object in his head was a gold throwing star. Neither Mr. Crepsley nor Harkat carried such a weapon - so who'd thrown it?</p><p>In answer to my unvoiced question, someone jumped from a nearby tree and strode towards me. \"Only ever turn your back on a corpse!\" the stranger snapped as I whirled towards him. \"Didn't Vanez Blane teach you that?\"</p><p>\"I... forgot,\" I wheezed, too taken aback to say anything else. The vampire - he had to be one of us - was a burly man of medium height, with reddish skin and dyed green hair, dressed in purple animal hides which had been stitched together crudely. He had huge eyes - almost as large as Harkat's - and a surprisingly small mouth. Unlike Mr. Crepsley, his eyes were uncovered, though he was squinting painfully in the sunlight. He wore no shoes and carried no weapons other than dozens of throwing stars strapped to several belts looped around his torso.</p><p>\"I'll have my shuriken back, thank you,\" the vampire said to the dead human, prying the throwing star loose, wiping it clean of blood, and reattaching it to one of the belts. He turned the man's head left and right, taking in the shaved skull, tattoos and red circles around the eyes. \"A vamped\" he snorted. \"I've clashed with them before. Miserable curs.\" He spat on the dead man, then used his bare foot to roll him over, so he was lying face down.</p>","<p>When the vampire turned to address me, I knew who he was - I'd heard him described many times - and greeted him with the respect he deserved. \"Vancha March,\" I said, bowing my head. \"It's an honour to meet you, Sire.\"</p><p>\"Likewise,\" he replied blithely.</p><p>Vancha March was the Vampire Prince I'd never met, the wildest and most traditional of all the Princes.</p><p>\"Vancha!\" Mr. Crepsley boomed, tearing the cloth away from around his eyes, crossing the space between us and clasping the Prince's shoulders. \"What are you doing here, Sire? I thought you were further north.\"</p><p>\"I was,\" Vancha sniffed, freeing his hands and wiping the knuckles of his left hand across his nose, then flicking something green and slimy away. \"But there was nothing happening, so I cut south. I'm heading for Lady Evanna's.\"</p><p>\"We are too,\" I said.</p><p>\"I figured as much. I've been trailing you for the last couple of nights.\"</p><p>\"You should have introduced yourself sooner, Sire,\" Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>\"This is the first time I've seen the new Prince,\" Vancha replied. \"I wanted to observe him from afar for a while.\" He studied me sternly. \"On the basis of this fight, I have to say I'm not overly impressed!\"</p><p>\"I erred, Sire,\" I said stiffly. \"I was worried about my friends and I made the mistake of pausing when I should have pushed ahead. I accept full responsibility, and I apologize most humbly.\"</p><p>\"At least he knows how to make a good apology,\" Vancha laughed, clapping me on the back.</p><p>Vancha March was covered in grime and dirt and smelt like a wolf. It was his standard appearance. Vancha was a true being of the wilds. Even among vampires, he was considered an extremist. He only wore clothes that he'd made himself from wild animal skins, and he never ate cooked meat or drank anything other than fresh water, milk and blood.</p><p>As Harkat limped towards us - having finished off his attacker - Vancha sat and crossed his legs. Lifting his left foot, he lowered his head to it and started biting the nails!</p><p>\"So this is the Little Person who talks,\" Vancha mumbled, eyeing Harkat over the nail of his left big toe. \"Harkat Mulds, isn't it?\"</p><p>\"It is, Sire,\" Harkat replied, lowering his mask.</p><p>\"I might as well tell you straight up, Mulds - I don't trust Desmond Tiny or any of his stumpy disciples.\"</p><p>\"And I don't trust vampires who... chew their toenails,\" Harkat threw back at him, then paused and added slyly, \"Sire!\"</p><p>Vancha laughed at that and spat out a chunk of nail. \"I think we're going to get along fine, Mulds!\"</p><p>\"Hard trek, Sire?\" Mr. Crepsley asked, sitting down beside the Prince, covering his eyes with cloth again.</p><p>\"Not bad,\" Vancha grunted, uncrossing his legs. He then started in on his right toenails. \"Yourselves?\"</p><p>\"The travelling has been good.\"</p><p>\"Any news from Vampire Mountain?\" Vancha asked.</p><p>\"Lots,\" Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>\"Save it for tonight.\" Vancha let go of his foot and lay back. He took off his purple cloak and draped it over himself. \"Wake me when it's dusk,\" he yawned, rolled over, fell straight asleep and started to snore.</p><p>I stared, goggle-eyed, at the sleeping Prince, then at the nails he'd chewed off and spat out, then at his ragged clothes and dirty green hair, then at Harkat and Mr. Crepsley. \"He's a Vampire Prince?\" I whispered.</p><p>\"He is,\" Mr. Crepsley smiled.</p><p>\"But he looks like...\" Harkat muttered uncertainly. \"He acts like...\"</p><p>\"Do not be fooled by appearances,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Vancha chooses to live roughly, but he is the finest of vampires.\"</p><p>\"If you say so,\" I responded dubiously, and spent most of the day lying on my back, staring up at the cloudy sky, kept awake by the loud snoring of Vancha March.</p><p>Chapter ELEVEN</p><p>WE LEFT the vampets lying where we'd killed them (Vancha said they weren't worthy of burial) and set off at dusk. As we marched, Mr. Crepsley told the Prince of Mr. Tiny's visit to Vampire Mountain, and what he'd predicted. Vancha said little while Mr. Crepsley was talking, and brooded upon his words in silence for a long time after he finished.</p><p>\"I don't think it takes a genius to surmise that I'm the third hunter,\" he said in the end.</p><p>\"I would be most surprised if you were not,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed.</p><p>Vancha had been picking between his teeth with the tip of a sharp twig. Now he tossed it aside and spat into the dust of the trail. Vancha was a master spitter - his spit was thick, globular and green, and he could hit an ant at twenty paces. \"I don't trust that evil meddler, Tiny,\" he snapped. \"I've run into him a couple of times, and I've made a habit of doing the opposite of anything he says.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley nodded. \"Generally speaking, I would agree with you. But these are dangerous times, Sire, and-\"</p><p>\"Larten!\" the Prince interrupted. \"Its 'Vancha', 'March' or 'Hey, ugly! while we're on the trail. I won't have you kowtowing to me.\"</p><p>\"Very well-\" Mr. Crepsley grinned \" - ugly.\" He grew serious again. \"These are dangerous times, Vancha. The future of our race is at stake. Dare we ignore Mr. Tiny's prophecy? If there is hope, we must seize it.\"</p><p>Vancha let out a long, unhappy sigh. \"For hundreds of years, Tiny's let us think we were doomed to lose the war when the Vampaneze Lord arose. Why does he tell us now, after all this time, that it isn't cut and dried, but we can only prevent it if we follow his instructions?\" The Prince scratched the back of his neck and spat into the bush to our left. \"It sounds like a load of guano to me!\"</p><p>\"Maybe Evanna can shed light on the subject,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"She shares some of Mr. Tiny's powers and can sense the paths of the future. She might be able to confirm or dismiss his predictions.\"</p><p>\"If so, I'll believe her,\" Vancha said. \"Evanna guards her tongue closely, but when she speaks, she speaks the truth. If she says our destiny lies on the road, I'll gladly pitch in with you. If not...\" He shrugged and let the matter rest.</p><p>Vancha March was weird - and that was putting it mildly! I'd never met anyone like him. He had a code all of his own.</p><p>As I already knew, he wouldn't eat cooked meat or drink anything but fresh water, milk and blood, and he made his clothes from the hides of animals he hunted. But I learnt much more about him during the six nights it took us to reach Lady Evanna's.</p>","<p>He followed the old ways of the vampires. Long ago, vampires believed that we were descended from wolves. If we lived good lives and stayed true to our beliefs, we'd become wolves again when we died and roam the wilds of Paradise as spirit creatures of the eternal night. To that end, they lived more like wolves than humans, avoiding civilization except when they had to drink blood, making their own clothes, following the laws of the wild.</p><p>Vancha wouldn't sleep in a coffin - he said they were too comfortable! He thought a vampire should sleep on open ground, covering himself with no more than his cloak. He respected vampires who used coffins but had a very low opinion of those who slept in beds. I didn't dare tell him about my preference for hammocks!</p><p>He had a great interest in dreams, and often ate wild mushrooms which led to vibrant dreams and visions. He believed the future was mapped out in our dreams, and if we learnt to decipher them, we could control our destinies. He was fascinated by Harkat's nightmares and spent many long hours discussing them with the Little Person.</p><p>The only weapons he used were his shurikens (the throwing stars), which he carved himself from various metals and stones. He thought hand to hand combat should be exactly that - fought with one's hands. He'd no time for swords, spears or axes and refused to touch them.</p><p>\"But how can you fight someone who has a sword?\" I asked one evening as we were getting ready to break camp. \"Do you run?\"</p><p>\"I run from nothing!\" he replied sharply. \"Here - let me show you.\" Rubbing his hands together, he stood opposite me and told me to draw my sword. When I hesitated, he slapped my left shoulder and jeered. \"Afraid?\"</p><p>\"Of course not,\" I snapped. \"I just don't want to hurt you.\"</p><p>He laughed out loud. \"There's not much fear of that, is there, Larten?\"</p><p>\"I would not be so sure,\" Mr. Crepsley demurred. \"Darren is only a half-vampire but he is sharp. He could test you, Vancha.\"</p><p>\"Good,\" the Prince said. \"I relish worthy opponents.\"</p><p>I looked pleadingly at Mr. Crepsley. \"I don't want to draw on an unarmed man.\"</p><p>\"Unarmed?\" Vancha shouted. \"I have two arms!\" He waved them at me.</p><p>\"Go ahead,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Vancha knows what he is doing.\"</p><p>Pulling out my sword, I faced Vancha and made a halfhearted lunge. He didn't move. Simply watched as I pulled the tip of my sword up short.</p><p>\"Pathetic,\" he sniffed.</p><p>\"This is stupid,\" I told him. \"I'm not-\"</p><p>Before I could say anything else, he darted forward, seized me by the throat and made a small, painful cut across my neck with his nails.</p><p>\"Ow!\" I yelled, stumbling away from him.</p><p>\"Next time I'll cut your nose off,\" he said pleasantly.</p><p>\"No you won't!\" I growled and swung at him with my sword, properly this time.</p><p>Vancha ducked clear of the arc of the blade. \"Good,\" he grinned. \"That's more like it.\"</p><p>He circled me, eyes on mine, fingers flexing slowly. I kept the tip of my sword low, until he came to a halt, then moved towards him and jabbed. I expected him to shift aside, but instead he brought the palm of his right hand up and swiped the blade away, as he would a flat stick. As I struggled to bring it back around, he stepped in, caught hold of my hand above the wrist, gave a sharp twist which caused me to release the sword - and I was weaponless.</p><p>\"See?\" he smiled, stepping back and raising his hands to show the fight was at an end. \"If this was for real, your ass would be grass.\" Vancha had a foul mouth - that was one of his tamest insults!</p><p>\"Big deal,\" I sulked, rubbing my sore wrist. \"You beat a half-vampire. You couldn't win against a full-vampire or a vampaneze.\"</p><p>\"I can and have,\" he insisted. \"Weapons are tools of fear, used by those who are afraid. One who learns to fight with his hands always has the advantage over those who rely on swords and knives. Know why?\"</p><p>\"Why?\"</p><p>\"Because they expect to win,\" he beamed. \"Weapons are false - they're not of nature - and inspire false confidence. When I fight, I expect to die. Even now, when I sparred with you, I anticipated death and resigned myself to it. Death is the worst this world can throw at you, Darren - if you accept it, it has no power over you.\"</p><p>Picking up my sword, he handed it to me and watched to see what I'd do. I had the feeling he wanted me to cast it aside - and I was tempted to, to earn his respect. But I'd have felt naked without it, so I slid it back into its sheath and glanced down at the ground, slightly ashamed.</p><p>Vancha clasped the back of my neck and squeezed amiably. \"Don't let it bother you,\" he said. \"You're young. You have loads of time to learn.\" His eyes creased as he thought about Mr. Tiny and the Lord of the Vampaneze, and he added gloomily, \"I hope.\"</p><p>I asked Vancha to teach me how to fight bare-handed. I'd studied unarmed combat in Vampire Mountain, but that had been against opponents who were also unarmed. Apart from a few lessons regarding what to do if I lost my weapon during battle, I'd never been taught how to take on a fully armed foe using only my hands. Vancha said it would take years to master, and I could expect lots of nicks and bruises while learning. I waved away such concerns - I loved the thought of being able to best an armed vampaneze with my bare hands.</p><p>Training couldn't start on the trail, but Vancha talked me through a few basic blocking tactics when we rested by day, and promised to give me a real work out when we got to Evanna's.</p><p>The Prince would tell me no more about the witch than Mr. Crepsley had, though he did say she was both the fairest and least attractive of women - which made no sense at all!</p><p>I thought Vancha would be strongly anti-vampaneze - the vampires who despised vampaneze the most were normally those steeped in the old ways - but to my surprise he had nothing against them. \"Vampaneze are noble and true,\" he said a couple of nights before we reached Evanna's. \"I don't agree with their feeding habits - there's no need to kill when we drink - but otherwise I admire them.\"</p><p>\"Vancha nominated Kurda Smahlt to become a Prince,\" Mr. Crepsley remarked.</p><p>\"I admired Kurda,\" Vancha said. \"He was known for his brains, but he also had guts. He was a remarkable vampire.\"</p><p>\"Don't you...\" I coughed and trailed off into silence.</p><p>\"Say what's on your mind,\" Vancha told me.</p>","<p>\"Don't you feel bad for nominating him, after what he did, leading the vampaneze against us?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Vancha said bluntly. \"I don't approve of his actions, and if I'd been at Council, I wouldn't have spoken up on his behalf. But he was following his heart. He acted for the good of the clan. Misguided as he was, I don't think Kurda was a real traitor. He acted poorly, but his motives were pure.\"</p><p>\"I agree,\" Harkat said, joining the conversation. \"I think Kurda's been poorly treated. It was right that he was killed when he... was captured, but it's wrong to say he was a villain, and not mention his name... in the Hall of Princes.\"</p><p>I didn't respond to that. I'd liked Kurda immensely, and knew he'd done his best to spare the vampires the wrath of the Vampaneze Lord. But he'd killed one of my other friends - Gavner Purl - and brought about the death of more, including Arra Sails, a female vampire who'd once been Mr. Crepsley's mate.</p><p>I learnt the identity of Vancha's real enemy the day before we came to the end of the first leg of our journey. I'd been sleeping, but my face was itchy - an after-effect of the purge - and I awoke before midday. I sat up, scratching under my chin, and spotted Vancha at the edge of camp, his clothes tossed aside - except for a strip of bear hide tied around his waist - rubbing spit into his skin.</p><p>\"Vancha?\" I asked quietly. \"What are you doing?\"</p><p>\"I'm going walking,\" he said, and continued rubbing spit into the flesh of his shoulders and arms.</p><p>I stared up at the sky. It was a bright day and hardly any clouds were around to block out the sun. \"Vancha, it's daytime\" I said.</p><p>\"Really?\" he replied sarcastically. \"I'd never have guessed.\"</p><p>\"Vampires burn in sunlight,\" I said, wondering if he'd bumped his head and forgotten what he was.</p><p>\"Not immediately,\" he said, then looked at me sharply.</p><p>\"Have you ever wondered why vampires burn in the sun?\"</p><p>\"Well, no, not exactly...\"</p><p>\"There's no logical reason,\" Vancha said. \"According to the stories humans tell, it's because we're evil, and evil beings can't face the sun. But that's nonsense - we're not evil, and even if we were, we should still be able to move about during the day.</p><p>\"Look at wolves,\" he continued. \"We're supposed to be descended from them, but they can endure the sunlight. Even true nocturnal creatures like bats and owls can survive by day. Sunlight might confuse them, but it doesn't kill them. So why does it kill vampires?\"</p><p>I shook my head uncertainly. \"I don't know. Why?\"</p><p>Vancha barked a laugh. \"Damned if I know! Nobody does. Some claim we were cursed by a witch or sorcerer, but I doubt that - the world's full of servants of the dark arts, but none with the power to make such a lethal curse. My hunch is Desmond Tiny.\"</p><p>\"What's Mr. Tiny got to do with it?\" I asked.</p><p>\"According to ancient legends - forgotten by most - Tiny created the first vampires. They say he experimented on wolves and mixed their blood with that of humans, resulting in...\" He tapped his chest.</p><p>\"That's ridiculous,\" I snorted.</p><p>\"Perhaps. But if those legends are true, our sun-related weakness is also Tiny's work. They say he was afraid we'd grow too powerful and take over the world, so he tainted our blood and made us slaves of the night.\" He stopped rubbing spit in and gazed upwards, eyes scrunched up against the disorientating rays of sunlight. \"Nothing's as awful as slavery,\" he said quietly. \"If the stories are true, and we're night slaves because of Tiny's meddling, there's only one way to win back our freedom - fight! We have to take on the enemy, look it full in the face and spit in its eye.\"</p><p>\"You mean fight Mr. Tiny?\"</p><p>\"Not directly. He's too slippery a customer to pin down.\"</p><p>\"Then who?\"</p><p>\"We have to fight his manservant,\" he said. When I looked blank, he elaborated: \"The sun.\"</p><p>\"The sun?\" I laughed, then stopped when I saw he was serious. \"How can you fight the sun?\"</p><p>\"Simple,\" Vancha said. \"You face it, take its blows, and keep coming back for more. For years I've been subjecting myself to the rays of the sun. Every few weeks I walk about for an hour by day, letting the sun burn me, toughening my skin and eyes to it, testing it, seeing how long I can survive.\"</p><p>\"You're crazy!\" I chortled. \"Do you really think you can get the better of the sun?\"</p><p>\"I don't see why not,\" he said. \"A foe's a foe. If it can be engaged, it can be defeated.\"</p><p>\"Have you made any progress?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Not really,\" he sighed. \"It's much the same as when I began. The light half-blinds me - it takes almost a full day for my vision to return to normal and the headaches to fade. The rays cause a reddening within ten or fifteen minutes, and it gets painful soon after. I've managed to endure it for close to eighty minutes a couple of times, but I'm badly burnt by the end, and it takes five or six nights of total rest to recover.\"</p><p>\"When did this war of yours begin?\"</p><p>\"Let's see,\" he mused. \"I was about two hundred when I started-\" Most vampires weren't sure of their exact age; when you lived as long as they did, birthdays ceased to mean very much \"-and I'm more than three hundred now, so I guess it's been the best part of a century.\"</p><p>\"A hundred years!\" I gasped. \"Have you ever heard the phrase, 'banging your head against a brick wall'?\"</p><p>\"Of course,\" he smirked, \"but you forget, Darren - vampires can break walls with their heads!\"</p><p>With that, he winked and walked off into the sunlight, whistling loudly, to engage in his crazy battle with a huge ball of burning gas hanging millions and millions of kilometres away in the sky.</p><p>Chapter TWELVE</p><p>A FULL moon was shining when we arrived at Lady Evanna's. Even so, I'd have missed the clearing if Mr. Crepsley hadn't nudged me and said, \"We are here.\" I later learnt that Evanna had cast a masking spell over the place, so unless you knew where to look, your eyes would skim over her home and not register it.</p><p>I stared straight ahead, but for a few seconds could see nothing but trees. Then the power of the spell faded, the imaginary trees 'vanished' and I found myself gazing down upon a crystal-clear pond, glowing a faint white colour from the light of the moon. There was a hill on the opposite side of the pond, and I could see the dark, arched entrance of a huge cave in it.</p>","<p>As we strolled down the gentle slope to the pond, the night air filled with the sound of croaking. I stopped, alarmed, but Vancha smiled and said, \"Frogs. They're alerting Evanna. They'll stop once she tells them it's safe.\"</p><p>Moments later the frog chorus ceased and we walked in silence again. We skirted the edge of the pond, Mr. Crepsley and Vancha warning Harkat and me not to step on any frogs, thousands of which were at rest by or in the cool water.</p><p>\"The frogs are creepy,\" Harkat whispered. \"I feel like they're... watching us.\"</p><p>\"They are,\" Vancha said. \"They guard the pond and cave, protecting Evanna from intruders.\"</p><p>\"What could a bunch of frogs do against intruders?\" I laughed.</p><p>Vancha stooped and grabbed a frog. Holding it up to the moonlight, he gently squeezed its sides. Its mouth opened and a long tongue darted out. Vancha caught the tongue with the index finger and thumb of his right hand, careful not to touch the edges. \"See the tiny sacs along the sides?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Those yellow-red bulges?\" I said. \"What about them?\"</p><p>\"Filled with poison. If this frog wrapped its tongue around your arm or the calf of your leg, the sacs would pop and the poison would seep in through your flesh.\" He shook his head grimly. \"Death in thirty seconds.\"</p><p>Vancha laid the frog down on the damp grass and let go of its tongue. It hopped away about its business. Harkat and me walked with extreme care after that!</p><p>When we reached the mouth of the cave, we stopped. Mr. Crepsley and Vancha sat down and laid aside their packs. Vancha took out a bone he'd been chewing on for the last couple of nights and got to work on it, pausing only to spit at the occasional frog which wandered too close to us.</p><p>\"Aren't we going in?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Not without being invited,\" Mr. Crepsley replied. \"Evanna does not take kindly to intruders.\"</p><p>\"Isn't there a bell we can ring?\"</p><p>\"Evanna has no need of bells,\" he said. \"She knows we are here and will come to greet us in her own time.\"</p><p>\"Evanna's not a lady to be rushed,\" Vancha agreed. \"A friend of mine thought he'd enter the cave on the quiet once, to surprise her.\" He munched cheerfully on his bone. \"She gave him huge warts all over. He looked like... like...\" Vancha frowned. \"It's hard to say, because I've never seen anything quite like it - and I've seen most everything in my time!\"</p><p>\"Should we be here if she's that dangerous?\" I asked worriedly.</p><p>\"Evanna will not harm us,\" Mr. Crepsley assured me. \"She has a quick temper, and it's best not to rile her, but she would never kill one with vampire blood, unless provoked.\"</p><p>\"Just make sure you don't call her a witch,\" Vancha warned, for what must have been the hundredth time.</p><p>Half an hour after we'd settled by the cave, dozens of frogs - larger than those surrounding the pond - came hopping out. They formed a circle around us and sat, blinking slowly, hemming us in. I started to get to my feet, but Mr. Crepsley told me to stay seated. Moments later, a woman emerged from the cave. She was the ugliest, most unkempt woman I'd ever seen. She was short - barely taller than the squat Harkat Mulds - with long, dark, untidy hair.</p><p>She had rippling muscles and thick, strong legs. Her ears were sharply pointed, her nose was tiny - it looked like there were just two holes above her upper lip - and her eyes were narrow. When she got closer, I saw that one eye was brown and the other green. What was even stranger was that the colours switched - one minute her left eye would be brown, the next her right.</p><p>She was extraordinarily hairy. Her arms and legs were covered with black hair; her eyebrows were two large caterpillars; bushy hair grew out of her ears and nostrils; she had a fairly full beard, and her moustache would have put Otto von Bismarck to shame.</p><p>Her fingers were surprisingly stubby. As a witch, I'd expected her to have bony claws, though I guess that's an image I got from books and comics I read when I was a child. Her nails were cut short, except for on the two little fingers, where they grew long and sharp.</p><p>She didn't wear traditional clothes, or animal hides like Vancha. Instead she dressed in ropes. Long, thickly woven, yellow ropes, wrapped around her chest and lower body, leaving her arms, legs and stomach free.</p><p>I'd have found it hard to imagine a more fearsome, off-putting woman, and my insides gurgled uneasily as she shuffled towards us.</p><p>\"Vampires!\" she snorted, stepping through the ranks of frogs, which parted as she advanced. \"Always ugly bloody vampires! Why don't handsome humans ever come a-calling?\"</p><p>\"They're probably afraid you'd eat them,\" Vancha laughed in reply, then stood and hugged her. She hugged back, hard, and lifted the Vampire Prince off his feet.</p><p>\"My little Vancha,\" she cooed, as though cuddling a baby. \"You've put on some weight, Sire.\"</p><p>\"And you're uglier than ever, Lady,\" he grunted, gasping for breath.</p><p>\"You're only saying that to please me,\" she giggled, then dropped him and turned to Mr. Crepsley. \"Larten,\" she nodded politely.</p><p>\"Evanna,\" he replied, standing and bowing. Then, without warning, he kicked out at her. But, swift as he was, the witch was swifter. She grabbed his leg and twisted. He rolled over and collapsed flat on the ground. Before he could react, Evanna jumped on his back, grabbed his chin and pulled his head up sharply.</p><p>\"Surrender?\" she yelled.</p><p>\"Yes!\" he wheezed, face reddening - not with shame, but pain.</p><p>\"Wise boy,\" she laughed, and kissed his forehead quickly.</p><p>Then she stood and studied Harkat and me, running a curious green eye over Harkat and a brown one over me.</p><p>\"Lady Evanna,\" I said as warmly as I could, trying not to let my teeth chatter.</p><p>\"It is good to meet you, Darren Shan,\" she replied. \"You are welcome.\"</p><p>\"Lady,\" Harkat said, bowing politely. He wasn't as nervous as me.</p><p>\"Hello, Harkat,\" she said, returning Harkat's bow. \"You are also welcome - as you were before.\"</p><p>\"Before?\" he echoed.</p><p>\"This is not your first visit,\" she said. \"You have changed in many ways, within and without, but I recognize you. I'm gifted that way. Appearances don't deceive me for long.\"</p><p>\"You mean... you know who I was... before I became a Little Person?\" Harkat asked, astonished. When Evanna nodded, he leant forward eagerly. \"Who was I?\"</p>","<p>The witch shook her head. \"Can't say. That's for you to find out.\"</p><p>Harkat wanted to push the matter, but before he could, she fixed her gaze on me and stepped forward to cup my chin between several cold, rough fingers. \"So this is the boy Prince,\" she murmured, turning my head left, then right. \"I thought you would be younger.\"</p><p>\"He was struck by the purge as we travelled here,\" Mr. Crepsley informed her.</p><p>\"That explains it.\" She hadn't let go of my face and still her eyes scanned me, as though probing for weakness.</p><p>\"So,\" I said, feeling as though I should speak, saying the first thing that popped into my head, \"you're a witch, are you?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley and Vancha groaned.</p><p>Evanna's nostrils flared and her head shot forward so our faces were millimetres apart. \"What did you call me?\" she hissed.</p><p>\"Um. Nothing. Sorry. I didn't mean it. I-\"</p><p>\"You two are to blame!\" she roared, spinning away from me to face a wincing Mr. Crepsley and Vancha March. \"You told him I was a witch!\"</p><p>\"No, Evanna,\" Vancha said quickly.</p><p>\"We told him not to call you that,\" Mr. Crepsley assured her.</p><p>\"I should gut the pair of you,\" Evanna growled, cocking the little finger of her right hand at them. \"I would, too, if Darren wasn't here - but I'd hate to make a bad first impression.\" Glowering hotly, she relaxed her little finger. Mr. Crepsley and Vancha relaxed too. I could barely believe it. I'd seen Mr. Crepsley face fully armed vampaneze without flinching, and was sure Vancha was every bit as composed in the face of great danger. Yet here they stood, trembling before a short, ugly woman with nothing more threatening than a couple of long fingernails!</p><p>I started to laugh at the vampires, but then Evanna whirled around and the laughter died on my lips. Her face had changed and she now looked more like an animal than a human, with a huge mouth and long fangs. I took a frightened step back. \"Mind the frogs!\" Harkat shouted, grabbing my arm to stop me stepping on one of the poisonous guards.</p><p>I glanced down to make sure I hadn't trodden on any frogs. When I looked up again, Evanna's face was back to normal. She was smiling. \"Appearances, Darren,\" she said. \"Never let them fool you.\" The air around her shimmered. When it cleared, she was tall, lithe and beautiful, with golden hair and a flowing white gown. My jaw dropped and I stared at her rudely, astonished by how pretty she was.</p><p>She clicked her fingers and was her original self again. \"I'm a sorceress,\" she said. \"A wyrd sister. An enchantress. A priestess of the arcane. I am not-\" she added, shooting a piercing look at Mr. Crepsley and Vancha, \"- a witch. I'm a creature of many magical talents. These allow me to take any shape I choose - at least in the minds of those who see me.\"</p><p>\"Then why...\" I started to say, before remembering my manners.</p><p>\"... do I choose this ugly form?\" she finished for me. Blushing, I nodded. \"I feel comfortable this way. Beauty means nothing to me. Looks are the least important thing in my world. This is the shape I assumed when I first took human form, so it is the shape I return to most often.\"</p><p>\"I prefer you when you're beautiful,\" Vancha muttered, then coughed gruffly when he realized he'd spoken aloud.</p><p>\"Be careful, Vancha,\" Evanna chuckled, \"or I'll take my hand to you as I did to Larten all those years ago.\" She cocked an eyebrow at me. \"Did he ever tell you how he got that scar?\"</p><p>I looked at the long scar running down the left side of Mr. Crepsley's face, and shook my head. The vampire was blushing a deep crimson colour. \"Please, Lady,\" he pleaded. \"Do not speak of it. I was young and foolish.\"</p><p>\"You most certainly were,\" Evanna agreed, and nudged me wickedly in the ribs. \"I was wearing one of my beautiful faces. Larten got tipsy on wine and tried to kiss me. I gave him a little scratch to teach him some manners.\"</p><p>I was stunned. I'd always thought he picked up the scar fighting vampaneze or some fierce animal of the wilds!</p><p>\"You are cruel, Evanna,\" Mr. Crepsley moped, stroking his scar miserably.</p><p>Vancha was laughing so hard that snot was streaming from his nose. \"Larten!\" he howled. \"Wait till I tell the others! I always wondered why you were so coy about that scar. Normally vampires boast about their wounds, but you-\"</p><p>\"Shut up!\" Mr. Crepsley snapped with uncharacteristic bluntness.</p><p>\"I could have healed it,\" Evanna said. \"If it had been stitched immediately, it wouldn't be half as noticeable as it is. But he took off like a kicked dog and didn't return for thirty years.\"</p><p>\"I did not feel wanted,\" Mr. Crepsley said softly.</p><p>\"Poor Larten,\" she smirked. \"You thought you were a real ladies' man when you were a young vampire, but...\" She pulled a face and cursed. \"I knew I'd forgotten something. I meant to have them set up when you arrived, but I got distracted.\" Muttering to herself, she turned to the frogs and made low, croaking noises.</p><p>\"What's she doing?\" I asked Vancha.</p><p>\"Talking to the frogs,\" he said. He was still grinning about Mr. Crepsley's scar.</p><p>Harkat gasped and dropped to his knees. \"Darren!\" he called, pointing to a frog. Crouching beside him, I saw that on the back of the frog was an eerily accurate image of Paris Skyle, done in dark green and black.</p><p>\"Weird,\" I said, and gently touched the image, ready to whip my hand back if the frog opened its mouth. I frowned and traced the lines more firmly. \"Hey,\" I said, \"this isn't paint. I think it's a birthmark\"</p><p>\"It can't be,\" Harkat said. \"No birthmark could look that... much like a person, especially not one we- Hey! There's another!\"</p><p>I turned and looked where he was pointing. \"That's not Paris,\" I said.</p><p>\"No,\" Harkat agreed, \"but it's a face. And there's a third.\" He pointed to a different frog.</p><p>\"And a fourth,\" I noted, standing and gazing around.</p><p>\"They must be painted on,\" Harkat said.</p><p>\"They're not,\" Vancha said. Bending, he picked up a frog and held it out for us to examine. This close to it, aided by the strong light of the moon, we could see that the marks were actually underneath the frog's uppermost layer of skin.</p><p>\"I told you Evanna bred frogs,\" Mr. Crepsley reminded us. He took the frog from Vancha and traced the shape of the face, which was burly and bearded. \"It is a mix of nature and magic. She finds frogs with strong natural markings, magically enhances them, and breeds them, producing faces. She is the only one in the world who can do it.\"</p>","<p>\"Here we are,\" Evanna said, pushing Vancha and me aside, leading nine frogs over to Mr. Crepsley. \"I feel guilty for lumbering you with that scar, Larten. I shouldn't have cut so deeply.\"</p><p>\"It is forgotten, Lady,\" he smiled gently. \"The scar is part of me now. I am proud of it-\" he glared at Vancha \"-even if others can only mock.\"</p><p>\"Still,\" she said, \"it irks me. I've presented you with gifts over the years - such as the collapsible pots and pans - but they haven't satisfied me.\"</p><p>\"There is no need-\" Mr. Crepsley began.</p><p>\"Shut up and let me finish!\" she growled. \"I think at last I have a gift which will restore amends. It's not something you can take, just a little... token.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley looked down at the frogs. \"I hope you do not mean to give the frogs to me.\"</p><p>\"Not exactly.\" She croaked an order to the frogs and they rearranged themselves. \"I know Arra Sails was killed in the fighting with the vampaneze six years ago,\" she said. Mr. Crepsley's face dropped at the mention of Arras name. He'd been very close to her and had taken her death hard.</p><p>\"She died valiantly,\" he said.</p><p>\"I don't suppose you kept anything of hers, did you?\"</p><p>\"Such as?\"</p><p>\"A lock of hair, a knife which was dear to her, a scrap of her clothes?\"</p><p>\"Vampires do not indulge in such foolishness,\" he said gruffly.</p><p>\"They should,\" Evanna sighed. The frogs stopped moving, she looked down at them, nodded and stepped aside.</p><p>\"What are-\" Mr. Crepsley began, then fell silent as his eyes took in the frogs and the huge face spread across their backs.</p><p>It was the face of Arra Sails, a section on each frog's back. The face was perfect in every detail and boasted more colour than the faces on the other frogs - Evanna had worked in yellows, blues and reds, bringing life to its eyes, cheeks, lips and hair. Vampires can't be photographed - their atoms bounce around in a bizarre way, impossible to capture on film - but this was as close to a photo of Arra Sails as was imaginable.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley hadn't moved. His mouth was a tight line across the lower half of his face, but his eyes were filled with warmth, sadness and... love.</p><p>\"Thank you, Evanna,\" he whispered.</p><p>\"No need,\" she smiled softly, then looked around at the rest of us. \"I think we should leave him alone a while. Come into the cave.\"</p><p>Wordlessly we followed her in. Even the normally raucous Vancha March was quiet, pausing only to clasp Mr. Crepsley's left shoulder and squeeze comfortingly. The frogs hopped along after us, except the nine with Arra's features plastered across their backs. They stayed, held their shape and kept Mr. Crepsley company as he gazed sorrowfully at the face of his one-time mate and dwelt at length upon the painful past.</p><p>Chapter THIRTEEN</p><p>EVANNA HAD prepared a feast for us, but it was all vegetables and fruit - she was a vegetarian and wouldn't allow anyone to eat meat in her cave. Vancha teased her about it - \"Still on the cow-food, Lady?\" - but ate his share along with Harkat and me, though he only chose food which hadn't been cooked.</p><p>\"How can you eat that?\" I asked, revolted, as he tucked into a raw turnip.</p><p>\"All in the conditioning,\" he winked, biting deeply into it. \"Yum - a worm!\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley joined us as we were finishing. He was in a sombre mood for the rest of the night, saying little, staring off into space.</p><p>The cave was far more luxurious than the caverns of Vampire Mountain. Evanna had made a real home of it, with soft feather beds, wonderful paintings on the walls and huge candle-lit lamps which cast a rosy glow over everything. There were couches to lie on, fans to cool us, exotic fruit and wine. After so many years of rough living, it seemed like a palace.</p><p>As we relaxed and digested the meal, Vancha cleared his throat and broached our reason for being here. \"Evanna, we've come to discuss-\"</p><p>She silenced him with a quick wave of a hand. \"We'll have none of that tonight,\" she insisted. \"Official business can wait until tomorrow. This is a time for friendship and rest.\"</p><p>\"Very well, Lady. This is your domain and I bow to your wishes.\" Lying back, Vancha burped loudly, then looked for somewhere to spit. Evanna tossed a small silver pot at him. \"Ah!\" he beamed. \"A spittoon.\" He leant over and spat forcefully into it. There was a slight 'ping' and Vancha grunted happily.</p><p>\"I was cleaning up for days the last time he visited,\" Evanna remarked to Harkat and me, \"Pools of spit everywhere. Hopefully the spittoon will keep him in order. Now if only there was something for him to flick his nose-pickings into...\"</p><p>\"Are you complaining about me?\" Vancha asked.</p><p>\"Of course not, Sire,\" she replied sarcastically. \"What woman could object to a man invading her home and covering the floor with mucus?\"</p><p>\"I don't think of you as a woman, Evanna,\" he laughed.</p><p>\"Oh?\" There was ice in her tone. \"What do you think of me as?\"</p><p>\"A witch,\" he said innocently, then leapt from the couch and raced out of the cave before she cast a spell on him.</p><p>Later, when Evanna had regained her sense of humour, Vancha snuck back in to his couch, fluffed up a cushion, stretched out and chewed at a wart on his left palm.</p><p>\"I thought you only slept on the floor,\" I remarked.</p><p>\"Ordinarily,\" he agreed, \"but it'd be impolite to refuse another's hospitality, especially when your host is the Lady of the Wilds.\"</p><p>I sat up curiously. \"Why do you call her a Lady? Is she a princess?\"</p><p>Vancha's laughter echoed through the cave. \"Do you hear that, Lady? The boy thinks you're a princess!\"</p><p>\"What's so strange about that?\" she asked, stroking her moustache. \"Don't all princesses look like this?\"</p><p>\"Beneath Paradise, perhaps,\" Vancha chuckled. Vampires believe that the souls of good vampires go beyond the stars to Paradise when they die. There isn't such a thing as hell in vampire mythology - most believe the souls of bad vampires stay trapped on Earth - but occasionally one would refer to a 'beneath Paradise'.</p><p>\"No,\" Vancha said seriously. \"Evanna's far more important and regal than any mere princess.\"</p><p>\"Why, Vancha,\" she cooed, \"that was almost flattering.\"</p><p>\"I can flatter when I want,\" he said, then broke wind loudly. \"And flutter too!\"</p>","<p>\"Disgusting,\" Evanna sneered, but she had a hard time hiding a smile.</p><p>\"Darren was asking about you on the way here,\" Vancha said to Evanna. \"We told him nothing of your past. Would you care to fill him in?\"</p><p>Evanna shook her head. \"You tell it, Vancha. I'm not in the mood for story-telling. But keep it short,\" she added, as he opened his mouth to begin.</p><p>\"I will,\" he promised.</p><p>\"And don't be rude.\"</p><p>\"Lady Evanna!\" he gasped. \"Am I ever?\" Grinning, he ran a hand through his green hair, thought a while, then began in a soft voice which I hadn't heard him use before. \"Heed, children,\" he said, then cocked an eyebrow and said in his own voice, \"That's the way to begin a story. Humans start with 'Once upon a time', but what do humans know about-\"</p><p>\"Vancha,\" Evanna interrupted. \"I said keep it short.\"</p><p>Vancha grimaced, then started over, again in his soft voice. \"Heed, children - we creatures of the night were not made to beget heirs. Our women can't give birth and our men can't sire children. This is the way it's been since the first vampire walked by the light of the moon, and the way we thought it would always be.</p><p>\"But seventeen hundred years ago, there lived a vampire by the name of Corza Jarn. He was ordinary in all respects, making his way in the world, until he fell in love and mated with a vampiress called Sarfa Grail. They were happy, hunting and fighting side by side, and when the first term of their mating agreement elapsed, they agreed to mate again.\"</p><p>That's how vampire 'marriages' work. Vampires don't agree to stay with one another for life, only for ten, fifteen or twenty years. Once that time is up, they can agree to another decade or two together, or go their separate ways.</p><p>\"Midway through their second term,\" Vancha continued, \"Corza grew restless. He wished to have a baby with Sarfa and raise a child of his own. He refused to accept then-natural limitations and went looking for the cure to vampire sterility. For decades he searched in vain, the loyal Sarfa by his side. A hundred years came and went. Two hundred. Sarfa died during the quest but this didn't put Corza off - if anything, it made him search even harder for a solution. Finally, fourteen hundred years ago, his search led him to that meddler with the watch - Desmond Tiny.</p><p>\"Now,\" Vancha said gruffly, \"it's not known exactly how much power Mr. Tiny wields over vampires. Some say he created us, others that he once was one of us, others still that he's simply an interested observer. Corza Jarn knew no more about Tiny's true self than the rest, but he believed the magician could help, and followed him around the world, begging him to put an end to the barren curse of the vampire clan.</p><p>\"For two centuries Mr. Tiny laughed at Corza Jarn and waved his pleas away. He told the vampire - now old and feeble, close to death - to stop worrying. He said children weren't meant for vampires. Corza wouldn't accept this. He pestered Tiny and begged him to give the vampires hope. He offered his soul in exchange for a solution, but Mr. Tiny sneered and said if he wanted Corza's soul, he would simply take it.\"</p><p>\"I haven't heard that part of the story before,\" Evanna cut in.</p><p>Vancha shrugged. \"Legends are flexible. I think it's good to remind people of Tiny's cruel nature, so I do, every chance I get.</p><p>\"Eventually,\" he returned to the story, \"for reasons of his own, Tiny relented. He said he'd create a woman capable of bearing a vampire's child, but added a catch - the woman and her children would either make the clan more powerful than ever... or destroy us completely!</p><p>\"Corza was troubled by Tiny's words, but he'd sought too long and hard to be dissuaded by the threat. He agreed to Tiny's terms, and let him take some of his blood. Tiny mixed Corza's blood with that of a pregnant wolf and worked strange charms on her. The wolf gave birth to four cubs. Two were stillborn and normal in shape, but the others were alive - and human in appearance! One was a boy, the other a girl!\"</p><p>Vancha paused and looked at Evanna. Harkat and me looked too, our eyes wide. The witch grimaced, then stood and took a bow. \"Yes,\" she said, \"I was that hairy little she-cub.\"</p><p>\"The children grew quickly,\" Vancha went on. \"Within a year they were adults and left their mother and Corza, to seek out their destiny in the wilds. The boy went first, without saying anything, and nobody knows what became of him.</p><p>\"Before the girl left, she gave Corza a message to take to the clan. He was to tell them what had happened, and say that she took her duties very seriously. He was also to tell them that she was not ready for motherhood, and that no vampire should seek her out as a mate. She said there was much she had to consider, and it would be centuries - perhaps longer - before she made her choice.</p><p>\"That was the last any vampire saw of her for four hundred years.\"</p><p>He stopped, looked thoughtful for a moment, then picked up a banana and began to eat it, skin and all. \"The end,\" he mumbled.</p><p>\"The end?\" I shouted. \"It can't end there! What happened next? What did she do for those four centuries? Did she choose a mate when she came back?\"</p><p>\"She chose no mate,\" Vancha said. \"Still hasn't. As for what she got up to...\" He smiled. \"Maybe you should ask her yourselves.\"</p><p>Harkat and me turned to Evanna. \"Well?\" we asked together.</p><p>Evanna pursed her lips. \"I chose a name,\" she said.</p><p>I laughed. \"You can't have spent four hundred years picking a name!\"</p><p>\"That wasn't all I got up to,\" she agreed, \"but I devoted much of that time to the choice. Names are vital to beings of destiny. I have a role to play in the future, not just of the vampire clan, but of every creature in the world. The name I chose would have a bearing on that role. I settled in the end for Evanna.\" She paused. \"I think it was a good choice.\"</p><p>Rising, Evanna croaked something at her frogs, who set off for the mouth of the cave. \"I must go,\" she said. \"We have spoken enough of the past. I will be absent most of the day. When I return, we shall discuss your quest and the part I am to take in it.\" She departed after the frogs, and moments later had disappeared into the ripening rays of the dawn.</p><p>Harkat and me stared after her. Then Harkat asked Vancha if the legend he'd told was true. \"As true as any legend can be,\" Vancha replied cheerfully.</p>","<p>\"What does that mean?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"Legends change in the telling,\" Vancha said. \"Seventeen hundred years is a long time, even by vampire standards. Did Corza Jam really drag around the world after Desmond Tiny? Did that agent of chaos agree to help? Could Evanna and the boy have been born of a she-wolf?\" He scratched an armpit, sniffed his fingers and sighed. \"Only three people in the world know the truth - Desmond Tiny, the boy - if he still lives - and Lady Evanna.\"</p><p>\"Have you ever asked Evanna if it's true?\" Harkat enquired.</p><p>Vancha shook his head. \"I've always preferred a stirring good legend to boring old facts.\" With that, the Prince rolled over and dropped off to sleep, leaving Harkat and me to discuss the story quietly and wonder.</p><p>Chapter FOURTEEN</p><p>I AROSE with Vancha a couple of hours after midday and commenced my training in the shade near the cave entrance. Harkat watched us with interest, as did Mr. Crepsley when he woke early that afternoon. Vancha started me off with a stick, saying it would be months before he tried me with real weapons. I spent the afternoon watching him flick and stab the stick at me. I didn't have to do anything else, just observe the movements of the stick and learn to identify and anticipate the various ways an attacker had of using it.</p><p>We practised until Evanna returned, half an hour shy of sunset. She said nothing of where she'd been or what she'd been up to, and nobody enquired.</p><p>\"Having fun?\" she asked, entering the cave with her entourage of frogs.</p><p>\"Heaps,\" Vancha replied, throwing the stick away. \"The boy wants to learn to fight with his hands.\"</p><p>\"Are swords too heavy for him?\"</p><p>Vancha pulled a face. \"Very funny.\"</p><p>Evanna's laughter brightened the cave. \"I'm sorry. But fighting with hands - or swords - seems so childish. People should battle with their brains.\"</p><p>I frowned. \"How?\"</p><p>Evanna glanced at me, and all of a sudden the strength went from my legs and I fell to the floor. \"What's happening?\" I squealed, flopping about like a dying fish. \"What's wrong with me?\"</p><p>\"Nothing,\" Evanna said, and to my relief my legs returned to normal. \"That's how you fight with your brain,\" she said as I gathered myself together. \"Every part of the body connects to the brain. Nothing functions without it. Attack with your brain, and victory is all but assured.\"</p><p>\"Could I learn to do that?\" I asked eagerly.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Evanna said. \"But it would take a few hundred years and you would have to leave the vampires and become my assistant.\" She smiled. \"What do you think, Darren? Would it be worth it?\"</p><p>\"I'm not sure,\" I muttered. I liked the idea of learning magic, but living with Evanna wasn't appealing - with her quick temper, I doubted she'd make an understanding or forgiving teacher!</p><p>\"Let me know if you change your mind,\" she said. \"It's been a long time since I had an assistant, and none ever completed their studies - they all ran off after a few years, though I can't imagine why.\" Evanna brushed past us into the cave. Moments later she called us, and when we entered, we found another feast waiting.</p><p>\"Did you use magic to get it ready so quickly?\" I asked, sitting down to eat.</p><p>\"No,\" she replied. \"I simply moved a little faster than normal. I can work at quite a speed when I wish.\"</p><p>We ate a big dinner, then sat around a fire and discussed Mr. Tiny's visit to Vampire Mountain. Evanna seemed to know about it already, but let us tell the story and said nothing until we had finished. \"The three hunters,\" she mused once we'd brought her up to date. \"I have been waiting for you for many centuries.\"</p><p>\"You have?\" Mr. Crepsley asked, startled.</p><p>\"I lack Desmond's clear insight into the future,\" she said, \"but I see some of what is to come - or what might come. I knew three hunters would emerge to face the Vampaneze Lord, but I didn't know who they'd be.\"</p><p>\"Do you know if we'll be successful?\" Vancha asked, observing her keenly.</p><p>\"I doubt if even Desmond knows that,\" she said. \"Two strong futures lie ahead, each as possible as the other. It's rare for fate to boil down to two such evenly matched eventualities. Normally the paths of the future are many. When two exist like this, chance decides which the world will take.\"</p><p>\"What about the Lord of the Vampaneze?\" Mr. Crepsley asked. \"Have you any idea where he is?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" Evanna smiled.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley's breath caught in his throat.</p><p>\"But you won't tell us, will you?\" Vancha snorted in disgust.</p><p>\"No,\" she said, her smile spreading. Her teeth were long, jagged and yellow like a wolf's.</p><p>\"Will you tell us how we are to find him?\" Mr. Crepsley asked. \"And when?\"</p><p>\"I cannot,\" Evanna said. \"If I told, I would change the course of the future, and that's not allowed. You must search for him yourselves. I will accompany you on the next leg of your journey, but I cannot-\"</p><p>\"You're coming with us?\" Vancha exploded in astonishment.</p><p>\"Yes. But only as a travelling companion. I'll play no part in the quest to find the Vampaneze Lord.\"</p><p>Vancha and Mr. Crepsley exchanged uneasy looks.</p><p>\"You have never travelled with vampires before, Lady,\" Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>Evanna laughed. \"I know how important I am to your people, and for that reason I've avoided too much contact with the children of the night - I tire of vampires pleading with me to mate with them and have their babies.\"</p><p>\"Then why come with us now?\" Vancha asked bluntly.</p><p>\"There's someone I wish to meet,\" she answered. \"I could seek him alone, but I prefer not to. My reasons will become clear in time.\"</p><p>\"Witches are so bloody secretive,\" Vancha grumbled, but Evanna didn't rise to the bait.</p><p>\"If you prefer to travel without me, you may,\" she said. \"I will not impose my presence upon you.\"</p><p>\"We would be honoured to have you as an escort, Lady Evanna,\" Mr. Crepsley assured her. \"And please do not take offence if we appear suspicious or unwelcoming - these are troublesome, confusing times, and we bark where sometimes we should whisper.\"</p><p>\"Well put, Larten,\" she smiled. \"If that's settled, I'll pack my things and we'll take to the road.\"</p>","<p>\"So soon?\" Mr. Crepsley blinked.</p><p>\"Now is as good a time as ever.\"</p><p>\"I hope the frogs aren't coming,\" Vancha huffed.</p><p>\"I wasn't going to bring them,\" Evanna said, \"but now that you mention it...\" She laughed at his expression. \"Don't worry - my frogs will stay and keep things tidy for when I return.\" She started to leave, paused, turned slowly and squatted. \"One more thing,\" she said, and by her serious expression we knew something bad was coming. \"Desmond should have told you this, but he obviously chose not to - playing mind games, no doubt.\"</p><p>\"What is it, Lady?\" Vancha asked when she paused.</p><p>\"It concerns the hunt for the Vampaneze Lord. I don't know whether you'll succeed or fail, but I have seen into the future of each possible outcome and gleaned some facts of what lies in store.</p><p>\"I will not speak of the future where you succeed - it is not for me to comment on that - but if you fail...\" Again she stalled. Reaching out, she took both of Vancha's hands in her left - it seemed to have grown incredibly large - and Mr. Crepsley's in her right. While she held hands with them, she locked gazes with me, and spoke. \"I tell you this because I think you should know. I don't say it to frighten you, but to prepare you, should matters come to the worst.</p><p>\"Four times your paths are fated to cross with that of the Vampaneze Lord. If they do cross, on each occasion you will have it within your power to make an end of him. If you fail, the vampaneze are destined to win the War of the Scars. This you already know.</p><p>\"But what Desmond didn't tell you is - by the end of the hunt, if you have faced the Vampaneze Lord four times and failed to kill him, only one of you will be alive to witness the fall of the vampire clan.\" Lowering her gaze and removing her hands from Mr. Crepsley's and Vancha's, she said in something less than a whisper, \"The other two will be dead.?</p><p>Chapter FIFTEEN</p><p>WE SOLEMNLY filed out of Evanna's cave and circled the pond, each of us brooding about the witch's prophecy. We'd known from the start that this would be a peril-filled quest, with death never far from our heels. But it's one thing to anticipate your possible end, quite another to be told it's a certainty if you fail.</p><p>We followed no particular direction that first night, only walked aimlessly through the darkness, saying nothing, barely taking note of our surroundings. Harkat hadn't been included in Evanna's prophecy - he wasn't one of the hunters - but was as disturbed as the rest of us.</p><p>Towards dawn, as we were making camp, Vancha suddenly burst out laughing. \"Look at us!\" he hooted, as we stared at him uncertainly. \"We've been moping all night like four sad souls at a funeral. What idiots we've been!\"</p><p>\"You think it amusing to have a death sentence imposed on us, Sire?\" Mr. Crepsley asked archly.</p><p>\"Charna's guts!\" Vancha cursed. \"The sentence has been there since the start - all that's changed is that we know about it!\"</p><p>\"A little knowledge is a... dangerous thing,\" Harkat muttered.</p><p>\"That's a human way of thinking,\" Vancha chided him. \"I'd rather know what lies ahead, good or bad. Evanna has done us a favour by telling us.\"</p><p>\"How do you figure that?\" I asked.</p><p>\"She confirmed that we'll have four chances to kill the Vampaneze Lord. Think about it - four times his life will be ours to take. Four times we'll face him and do battle. He might get the better of us once. Perhaps twice. But do you really think he'll evade us four times in a row?\"</p><p>\"He will not be alone,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"He travels with guards, and all vampaneze in the area will rush to his aid.\"</p><p>\"What makes you think that?\" Vancha challenged him.</p><p>\"He is their Lord. They will sacrifice their lives to protect him.\"</p><p>\"Will our fellow vampires back us up if we run into trouble?\" Vancha responded.</p><p>\"No, but that is because...\" Mr. Crepsley stopped.</p><p>\"... Mr. Tiny's told them not to,\" Vancha grinned. \"And if he's picked just three vampires to go head to head with the Vampaneze Lord, maybe-\"</p><p>\"- he has only picked three vampaneze to help their Lord!\" Mr. Crepsley finished, excited.</p><p>\"Right,\" Vancha beamed. \"So the odds against us besting him are, in my view, better than even. Do you agree?\" All three of us nodded thoughtfully. \"Now,\" he continued, \"let's say we make a pig's ear of it. We face him four times, we blow it, and our chance to defeat him passes. What happens then?\"</p><p>\"He leads the vampaneze into war against the vampires and wins,\" I said.</p><p>\"Exactly.\" Vancha's smile faded. \"By the way, I don't believe that. I don't care how powerful their Lord is, or what Des Tiny says - in a war with the vampaneze, I'm certain we'll win. But if we don't, I'd rather die beforehand, fighting for our future, than be there to watch the walls of our world come crashing down.\"</p><p>\"Brave words,\" I grunted sourly.</p><p>\"The truth,\" Vancha insisted. \"Would you prefer to die at the hands of the Vampaneze Lord, when hope is still on our side, or survive and bear witness to the downfall of the clan?\" I didn't reply, so Vancha went on. \"If the predictions are true, and we fail, I don't want to be around for the end. It would be a terrible tragedy, and would madden anyone who saw it.</p><p>\"Believe me,\" Vancha said, \"the two who die in that eventuality will be fortunate. We shouldn't worry about dying - it's living we have to fear if we fail!\"</p><p>I didn't get much sleep that day, thinking about what Vancha had said. I doubt if any of us slept much, except Evanna, who snored even louder than the Prince.</p><p>Vancha was right. If we failed, the one who survived would have the worst time of all. He'd have to watch the vampires perish, and bear the burden of blame. If we were to fail, death along the way was the best any of us could hope for.</p><p>Our spirits had lifted when we rose that evening. We were no longer afraid of what lay ahead, and instead of talking negatively, we discussed our route. \"Mr. Tiny said to follow our hearts,\" Mr. Crepsley reminded us. \"He said fate would lead us if we placed ourselves in its hands.\"</p><p>\"You don't think we should try tracking down the Vampaneze Lord?\" Vancha asked.</p><p>\"Our people have spent six years seeking him, without success,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Of course we must keep our eyes peeled, but otherwise I believe we should go about our business as if he did not exist.\"</p>","<p>\"I don't like it,\" Vancha grumbled. \"Fate's a cruel mistress. What if destiny doesn't lead us to him? Do you want to report back in a year and say, 'Sorry, we didn't run into the blighter, bad luck, what??</p><p>\"Mr. Tiny said to follow our hearts,\" Mr. Crepsley repeated stubbornly.</p><p>Vancha threw his hands into the air. \"OK - we'll do it your way. But you two will have to pick the course - as many women have attested, I'm a boundless cad who doesn't have a heart.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley smiled thinly. \"Darren? Where do you want to go?\"</p><p>I started to say I didn't care, then stopped as an image flashed through my thoughts - a picture of a snake-boy sticking an extra long tongue up his nose. \"I'd like to see how Evra's doing,\" I said.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley nodded approvingly. \"Good. Just last night I was wondering what my old friend Hibernius Tall was up to. Harkat?\"</p><p>\"Sounds good to me,\" Harkat agreed.</p><p>\"So be it.\" Facing Vancha, Mr. Crepsley said in as imperious a tone as he could muster, \"Sire, we head for the Cirque Du Freak.\"</p><p>And so our direction was decided and the dice of destiny were cast.</p><p>Chapter SIXTEEN</p><p>MR. CREPSLEY was able to tap into Mr. Tall's thoughts and pinpoint the position of the Cirque Du Freak. The travelling circus was relatively near, and it would take us only three weeks to link up with it if we forced the pace.</p><p>After a week, we hit civilization again. As we passed a small town one night, I asked Mr. Crepsley why we didn't hop on a bus or train, which would get us to the Cirque Du Freak much quicker. \"Vancha does not approve of human modes of transport,\" he said. \"He has never been in a car or on a train.\"</p><p>\"Never!\" I asked the barefooted Prince.</p><p>\"I wouldn't even spit on a car,\" he said. \"Awful things. The shape, the noise, the smell.\" He shivered.</p><p>\"What about planes?\"</p><p>\"If the gods of the vampires meant for us to fly,\" he said, \"they'd have given us wings.\"</p><p>\"What about you, Evanna?\" Harkat asked. \"Have you ever flown?\"</p><p>\"Only on a broomstick,\" she said. I didn't know if she was joking or not.</p><p>\"And you, Larten?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"Once, long ago, when the Wright brothers were just getting going.\" He paused. \"It crashed. Luckily, it had not been flying very high, so I was not seriously injured. But these new contraptions, which soar above the clouds... I think not.\"</p><p>\"Afraid?\" I smirked.</p><p>\"Once bitten, twice shy,\" he replied.</p><p>We were a strange group, no doubt about it. We had almost nothing in common with humans. They were creatures of the technological age, but we belonged to the past - vampires knew nothing of computers, satellite dishes, microwave ovens, or any other modern conveniences; we travelled by foot most of the time, had simple tastes and pleasures, and hunted as animals. Where humans sent aeroplanes to wage their wars and fought by pressing buttons, we battled with swords and our hands. Vampires and humans might share the same planet, but we lived in different worlds.</p><p>I awoke one afternoon to the sound of Harkat's moans. He was having another nightmare and was tossing feverishly about on the grassy bank where he'd fallen asleep. I leant over to wake him. \"Hold,\" Evanna said. The witch was in the lower branches of a tree, observing Harkat with unseemly interest. A squirrel was exploring her head of long hair, and another was chewing on the ropes she used as clothes.</p><p>\"He's having a nightmare,\" I said.</p><p>\"He has them often?\"</p><p>\"Almost every time he sleeps. I'm supposed to wake him if I hear him having one.\" I bent to shake him awake.</p><p>\"Hold,\" Evanna said again, jumping down. She shuffled over and touched the three middle fingers of her right hand to Harkat's forehead. She closed her eyes and stood there a minute, then opened them and let go. \"Dragons,\" she said. \"Bad dreams. His time of insight is upon him. Did Desmond say nothing about revealing who Harkat was in his previous life?\"</p><p>\"Yes, but Harkat chose to come with us, to search for the Vampaneze Lord.\"</p><p>\"Noble but foolish,\" she mused.</p><p>\"If you told him who he was, would that ease his nightmares?\"</p><p>\"No. He must learn the truth himself. I'd make things worse if I meddled. But there is a way to temporarily ease his pain.\"</p><p>\"How?\" I asked.</p><p>\"One who speaks the language of the dragons could help.\"</p><p>\"Where will we find someone like that?\" I snorted, then paused. \"Can you...?\" I left the question hanging.</p><p>\"Not I,\" she said. \"I can talk to many animals, but not dragons. Only those who have bonded with the flying reptiles can speak their language.\" She stood. \"You could help.\"</p><p>\"Me?\" I frowned. \"I haven't bonded with a dragon. I've never even seen one. I thought they were imaginary.\"</p><p>\"In this time and place, they are,\" Evanna agreed. \"But there are other times and places, and bonds can be formed unknown.\"</p><p>That didn't make sense, but if I could somehow help Harkat, I would. \"Tell me what I have to do,\" I said.</p><p>Evanna smiled approvingly, then told me to lay my hands on Harkat's head and close my eyes. \"Focus,\" she said. \"We need to find an image for you to fix upon. How about the Stone of Blood? Can you picture it, red and throbbing, the blood of the vampires flowing through its mysterious veins?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said, bringing the stone effortlessly to mind.</p><p>\"Keep thinking of it. In a few minutes you'll experience unpleasant sensations, and maybe catch glimpses of Harkat's nightmares. Ignore them and stay focused on the Stone. I will do the rest.\"</p><p>I did as she said. At first it was easy, but then I began to feel strange. The air around me seemed to get hotter and it became harder to breathe. I heard the beating of immense wings, then caught a glimpse of something dropping from a blood-red sky. I cringed, almost let go of Harkat, but remembered Evanna's advice and forced myself to focus on the image of the Stone of Blood.</p><p>I sensed something huge land behind me, and felt hot eyes boring into my back, but I didn't turn or shrink away. I reminded myself that this was a dream, an illusion, and thought about the Stone.</p><p>Harkat appeared before me in the vision, stretched upon a bed of stakes, which impaled him all over. He was alive but in incredible pain. He couldn't see me - the tips of two stakes poked out of the sockets where his eyes should have been.</p>","<p>\"His pain is nothing to what you will feel,\" someone said, and looking up I saw a figure of shadows, elusive and dark, hovering close by.</p><p>\"Who are you?\" I gasped, momentarily forgetting about the Stone.</p><p>\"I am the Lord of the Crimson Night,\" he replied mockingly.</p><p>\"The Lord of the Vampaneze?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Of them and all others,\" the shadow man jeered. \"I have been waiting for you, Prince of the Damned. Now I have you - and I won't let go!\" The shadow man darted forward, his fingers ten long claws of dark menace. Red eyes glowed in the black pit that was his face. For a terrifying moment I thought he was going to grab and devour me. Then a tiny voice - Evanna's - whispered, \"It's just a dream. He can't hurt you, not yet, not if you focus on the Stone.\"</p><p>Shutting my eyes within the dream, I ignored the charge of the shadow man and concentrated on the pulsing Stone of Blood. There was a hissing scream and I felt as though a wave of frothing madness had broken over me. Then the nightmare faded and I was back in the real world.</p><p>\"You can open your eyes now,\" Evanna said. My eyes snapped open. I let go of Harkat and wiped my hands over my face, reacting as though I'd been touched by something dirty. \"You did well,\" Evanna congratulated me.</p><p>\"That... thing\" I gasped. \"What was it?\"</p><p>\"The Lord of Destruction,\" she said. \"The Master of Shadows. The would-be ruler of the eternal night.\"</p><p>\"He was so powerful, so evil.\"</p><p>She nodded. \"He will be.\"</p><p>\"Will be?\" I echoed.</p><p>\"What you saw was a shade of the future. The Lord of the Shadows has not yet come into his own, but he will, eventually. This cannot be avoided, and you should not worry about it. All that matters for the time being is that your friend will sleep untroubled now.\"</p><p>I glanced down at Harkat, who was resting peacefully. \"He's OK?\"</p><p>\"He will be, for a time,\" Evanna said. \"The nightmares will return, and when they do he'll have to face his past and learn who he was, or succumb to madness. But for now he can sleep soundly, unafraid.\"</p><p>She headed back to her tree.</p><p>\"Evanna,\" I stopped her with a soft call. \"This Lord of the Shadows... There was something familiar about him. I couldn't make out his face, but I felt I knew him.\"</p><p>\"So you should,\" she whispered in reply. She hesitated, pondering how much to tell me. \"What I say now is between you and me,\" she warned. \"It must go no further. You can tell no one, not even Larten or Vancha.\"</p><p>\"I won't,\" I promised.</p><p>Keeping her back to me, she said, \"The future is dark, Darren. There are two paths, and both are winding and troubled, paved with the souls of the dead. In one of the possible futures, the Vampaneze Lord has become the Master of Shadows and ruler of the dark. In the other...\"</p><p>She paused, and her head tilted backwards, as though she was staring up at the sky for an answer. \"In the other, the Lord of the Shadows is you.?</p><p>And she departed, leaving me confused and shaken, dearly wishing that Harkat's moans hadn't woken me up.</p><p>A couple of nights later, we hooked up with the Cirque Du Freak.</p><p>Mr. Tall and his band of magical performers were playing outside a small village, in an abandoned church. The show was drawing to a close when we arrived, so we slipped inside and watched the finale from the back. Sive and Seersa - the twisting twins - were onstage, twirling around each other and performing incredible acrobatic stunts. Mr. Tall came on after them, dressed in a dark suit, with his customary red hat and gloves, and said the show was over. People began to leave, many muttering about the weak finish, when two snakes slid down from the rafters, sending waves of fear rippling through the crowd.</p><p>I grinned when I saw the snakes. This was how most of the shows drew to a close. People were tricked into thinking the show was over, then the snakes appeared and gave the crowd one last scare. Before the serpents could do any damage, Evra Von - their master - would step in and calm them down.</p><p>Sure enough, as the snakes were about to slither on to the floor, Evra stepped forward. But he wasn't alone - there was a small child with him, who went to one of the snakes and controlled it as Evra controlled the other. The kid was a new addition. I assumed Mr. Tall had picked him up on his travels.</p><p>After Evra and the boy had wrapped the snakes around themselves, Mr. Tall came on again and said the show was over for real. We kept to the shadows while the crowd streamed past, chattering with excitement. Then, as Evra and the child unwound and brushed themselves down, I moved. \"Evra Von!\" I roared.</p><p>Evra whirled around, startled. \"Who's there?\" I didn't answer, but walked forward briskly. His eyes widened with astonished delight. \"Darren?\" he yelled, and threw his arms around me. I hugged him tightly, ignoring the feel of his slippery scales, delighted to see him after so many years. \"Where have you been?\" he cried when we let go of one another. There were tears of happiness in his eyes - mine were wet too.</p><p>\"Vampire Mountain,\" I said lightly. \"How about you?\"</p><p>\"All over the world.\" He studied me curiously. \"You've grown.\"</p><p>\"Only recently. And not as much as you.\" Evra was a man now. He was only a few years older than me, and we'd looked much the same age when I first joined the Cirque Du Freak, but now he could have passed for my father.</p><p>\"Good evening, Evra Von,\" Mr. Crepsley said, stepping forward to shake hands.</p><p>\"Larten,\" Evra nodded. \"It's been a long time. I'm glad to see you.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley stood to one side and introduced our companions. \"I would like you to meet Vancha March, Lady Evanna, and Harkat Mulds, whom I believe you already know.\"</p><p>\"Hello,\" Vancha grunted.</p><p>\"Greetings,\" Evanna smiled.</p><p>\"Hi, Evra,\" Harkat said.</p><p>Evra blinked. \"It spoke!\" he gasped.</p><p>\"Harkat speaks a lot these nights,\" I grinned.</p><p>\"It has a name?\"</p><p>\"It has,\" Harkat said. \"And 'it' would like very much... to be called 'he'.\"</p><p>Evra didn't know what to say. When I'd lived with him, we'd spent a lot of our time gathering food for the Little People, and never once had one of them said a word. We thought they couldn't speak. Now here I was with a Little Person - the limping one, whom we'd nicknamed Lefty - acting as if his being able to talk was no big deal.</p>","<p>\"Welcome back to the Cirque Du Freak, Darren,\" somebody said, and looking up I found myself face to belly button with Mr. Tall. I'd forgotten how quickly and silently the owner of the Cirque could move.</p><p>\"Mr. Tall,\" I replied, nodding politely (he didn't like to shake hands).</p><p>He greeted the others by name, including Harkat. When Harkat returned the greeting, Mr. Tall didn't look in the least surprised. \"Would you care to eat?\" he asked us.</p><p>\"That would be delightful,\" Evanna answered. \"And I would have a word or two with you afterwards, Hibernius. There are things we must discuss.\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" he agreed without batting an eyelid. \"There are.\"</p><p>As we filed out of the church, I fell in step with Evra to discuss old times. He was carrying his snake over his shoulders. The boy who'd performed with Evra caught up with us as we exited, dragging the other snake behind him like a toy. \"Darren,\" Evra said, \"I'd like you to meet Shancus.\"</p><p>\"Hello, Shancus,\" I said, shaking the boy's hand.</p><p>\"'Lo,\" he replied. He had the same yellow, green hair, narrow eyes, and multicoloured scales as Evra. \"Are you the Darren Shan I was named after?\" he asked.</p><p>I glanced sideways at Evra. \"Am I?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" he laughed. \"Shancus was my first-born. I thought it would be-\"</p><p>\"First-born?\" I interrupted. \"He's yours? You're his father?\"</p><p>\"I certainly hope so,\" Evra grinned.</p><p>\"But he's so big! So old!\"</p><p>Shancus preened proudly at the remark.</p><p>\"He'll be five soon,\" Evra said. \"He's large for his age. I started him out in the act a couple of months ago. He's a natural.\"</p><p>This was bizarre! Of course, Evra was old enough to be married with kids, and there was no reason for me to be surprised by the news - but it seemed like only a few months since we'd been hanging out together as teenagers, wondering what life would be like when we grew up.</p><p>\"You've got other children?\" I asked.</p><p>\"A couple,\" he said. \"Urcha - three - and Lilia, who'll be two next month.\"</p><p>\"Are they all snake-children?\"</p><p>\"Urcha isn't. He's upset - he wants scales too - but we try to make him feel as loved and extraordinary as the others.\"</p><p>\"We being...?\"</p><p>\"Me and Merla. You don't know her. She joined the show shortly after you left - ours was a whirlwind romance. She can detach her ears and use them as mini-boomerangs. You'll like her.\"</p><p>Laughing, I said I was sure I would, then followed Evra and Shancus after the others, to dinner.</p><p>It was wonderful to be back with the Cirque Du Freak. I'd been edgy and moody for the last week and a half, thinking about what Evanna had said, but my fears faded within an hour of returning to the circus fold. I met many old friends - Hans Hands, Rhamus Twobellies, Sive and Seersa, Cormac Limbs and Gertha Teeth. I also saw the Wolf Man, but he wasn't quite as welcome a sight as the others, and I kept clear of him as much as possible.</p><p>Truska - who could grow a beard at will, then suck the hairs back inside her face - was there too, and delighted to see me. She greeted me in broken English. She hadn't been able to speak the language six years ago, but Evra had been teaching her and she was making good progress. \"It is hard,\" she said as we mingled with the others in a large, run-down school which was serving as the Cirque's base. \"I not good at language. But Evra is patient and I slowly learning. I make mistakes still, but-\"</p><p>\"We all make mistakes, gorgeous,\" Vancha interrupted, popping up beside us. \"And yours was not making an honest vampire of me when you had the chance!\" He wrapped his arms around Truska and kissed her. She laughed when he let go and waved a finger at him.</p><p>\"Naughty!\" she giggled.</p><p>\"You two know each other, I take it,\" I commented dryly.</p><p>\"Oh, yes,\" Vancha leered. \"We're old friends. Many's the night we went skinny-dipping together in oceans deep and blue, eh, Truska?\"</p><p>\"Vancha,\" she tutted. \"You promised not of that to mention!\"</p><p>\"So I did,\" he chuckled, then began talking with her in her native tongue. They sounded like a pair of seals barking at each other.</p><p>Evra introduced me to Merla, who was very pleasant and pretty. He made her show me her detachable ears. I agreed that they were fabulous, but I declined her offer to let me have a go throwing them.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley was as pleased to be back as I was. As a dutiful vampire, he'd devoted most of his life to the Generals and their cause, but I suspect his heart lay secretly with the Cirque Du Freak. He loved to perform and I think he missed being on the stage. Many people asked him if he was back to stay, and expressed disappointment when he said he wasn't. He made light of it, but I think he was genuinely touched by their interest and would have stayed if he could.</p><p>There were Little People with the Cirque Du Freak, as usual, but Harkat kept away from them. I tried getting him involved in conversation with others, but people felt nervous around him - they weren't accustomed to a Little Person who could talk. He spent most of the night alone, or in a corner with Shancus, who was fascinated by him and kept asking impolite questions (most to do with whether he was a man or a woman - in fact, like all the Little People, he was neither).</p><p>Evanna was known by many people at the Cirque Du Freak, although very few of them had met her before - their parents, grandparents or great-grandparents had told them about her. She spent a few hours mingling and catching up on the past - she had an impressive memory for names and faces - then said her farewells for the night and departed with Mr. Tall, to discuss matters strange, portentous and arcane (or else to chat about frogs and magic tricks!).</p><p>We retired with the coming of the dawn. We bid goodnight to those still awake, then Evra guided us to our tents. Mr. Tall had kept Mr. Crepsley's coffin ready for him and the vampire climbed into it with a look of sheer contentment - vampires love their coffins in a way no human can ever understand.</p><p>Harkat and me strung up a couple of hammocks and slept in a tent next to Evra and Merla's. Evanna moved into a van adjoining Mr. Tall's. And Vancha... Well, when we met him that evening, he swore blind he'd stayed with Truska, and bragged about what a hit he was with the ladies. But by all the leaves and grass stuck to his hair and animal hides, I think it more likely he passed the day by himself under a bush!</p>","<p>Chapter SEVENTEEN</p><p>HARKAT AND me got up an hour or so before sunset and walked around the camp with Evra and Shancus. I was chuffed that Evra had named his first-born after me and promised to send the boy birthday presents in future, if I could. He wanted me to give him a spider - Evra had told him all about Madam Octa - but I had no intention of sending him one of the poisonous arachnids from Vampire Mountain - I knew from painful experience the trouble a tarantula could cause!</p><p>The Cirque Du Freak was much the same as ever. A few new acts had joined, and one or two had parted company with the show, but mostly it was as it had been. Though the circus hadn't changed, I had. I sensed that after a while, as we strolled from one caravan or tent to another, pausing to chat with the performers and stagehands. When I lived at the Cirque, I was young - in appearance at least - and people treated me as a child. They didn't any more. While I didn't look that much older, there must have been something different about me, because they no longer spoke down to me.</p><p>Although I'd been acting as an adult for years, this was the first time I really thought about how much I'd changed and how I could never return to the lighter days of my youth. Mr. Crepsley had been telling me for ages - usually when I complained about how slowly I was maturing - that a night would come when I'd wish I could be young again. Now I realized he was right. My childhood had been a long, drawn-out affair, but within a year or two the purge would rid me of both my human blood and youth, and after that there could be no going back.</p><p>\"You look pensive,\" Evra noted.</p><p>\"I'm thinking about how much things have changed,\" I sighed. \"You married and with kids. Me with worries of my own. Life used to be much simpler.\"</p><p>\"It always is for the young,\" Evra agreed. \"I keep telling Shancus that, but he doesn't believe me, any more than we did when we were growing up.\"</p><p>\"We're getting old, Evra.\"</p><p>\"No we aren't,\" he said. \"We're getting older. It'll be decades before I hit old age - centuries for you.\"</p><p>That was true, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd somehow grown ancient overnight. For more than twenty-five years I'd lived and thought as a child - Darren Shan, the boy Prince! - but now I didn't feel I was a child any longer.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley tracked us down as we were devouring hot sausages around a camp fire. Truska had cooked them and was handing them out. The vampire took one, thanked her, and swallowed it in two quick bites. \"Savoury,\" he said, licking his lips, then turned to me with a gleam in his eye. \"Would you care to take to the stage tonight? Hibernius has said we may perform.\"</p><p>\"What would we do?\" I asked. \"We don't have Madam Octa any longer.\"</p><p>\"I can perform magic tricks, as I did when I first joined the Cirque Du Freak, and you can be my assistant. With our vampiric speed and strength, we can pull off some truly remarkable conjuring feats.\"</p><p>\"I dunno,\" I said. \"It's been a long time. I might get stage fright.\"</p><p>\"Nonsense. You are doing it. I will not take no for an answer.\"</p><p>\"If you put it that way...\" I grinned.</p><p>\"You will need some grooming if we are to present ourselves to the public,\" Mr. Crepsley said, eyeing me critically. \"A haircut and manicure are in order.\"</p><p>\"I take care of that,\" Truska said. \"I also am having Darren's old pirate costume. I could fix up it to fit him again.\"</p><p>\"You've still got that old thing?\" I asked, remembering how cool I'd felt when Truska kitted me out as a pirate not long after I'd joined the Cirque Du Freak. I had to leave the fancy clothes behind when I left to travel to Vampire Mountain.</p><p>\"I am a good holder-on to things,\" she smiled. \"I fetch it and measure you. The suit might not be ready this tonight, but tomorrow I have it in shape. Come to me an hour now from, for measuring.\"</p><p>Vancha was jealous when he heard we were going to be performing. \"What about me?\" he grumbled. \"I know a bit of magic. Why can't I go on too?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley stared at the green-haired Prince, with his bare feet, muddy legs and arms, his animal hides and shurikens. He sniffed the air - Vancha had showered in rainfall about six nights earlier, but hadn't washed since - and crinkled his nose. \"You are not the essence of presentability, Sire,\" he remarked carefully.</p><p>\"What's wrong with me?\" Vancha asked, looking down, seeing nothing amiss.</p><p>\"One must be elegant when one takes to the stage,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"You lack a certain je ne sais quoi.\"</p><p>\"I don't know about that,\" I said. \"I think there's a perfect part for him in the show.\"</p><p>\"There!\" Vancha beamed. \"The boy has a keen eye.\"</p><p>\"He could go on at the start, with the Wolf Man,\" I said, only barely managing to keep a straight face. \"We could pretend they were brothers.\"</p><p>Vancha glared at me as Mr. Crepsley, Harkat, Evra and Shancus fell apart with laughter. \"You're getting too smart by far!\" he snapped, then stormed off to find someone to rant at.</p><p>At the appointed time I went to be measured and get my hair cut by Truska. Evra and Shancus also went to prepare for the show, while Harkat helped Mr. Crepsley search for props to use in his act.</p><p>\"Is life being good to you?\" Truska asked, snipping my newly-grown fringe.</p><p>\"It could be worse,\" I said.</p><p>\"Vancha told me you now are being a Prince.\"</p><p>\"He wasn't supposed to tell anyone,\" I complained.</p><p>\"Do not fear. I keep news myself to. Vancha and me old friends. He knows I can a secret keep.\" She lowered the pair of scissors and looked at me oddly. \"Have you seen anything of Mr. Tiny since leaving?\" she asked.</p><p>\"That's a strange question,\" I replied warily.</p><p>\"He here was, many months ago. Came see Hibernius.\"</p><p>\"Oh?\" That must have been before his trip to Vampire Mountain.</p><p>\"Hibernius was troubled after visit. He told me dark times are out in front of us. He said I might be wanting to think of going home to my people. Said I might be safer there.\"</p><p>\"Did he say anything about-\" I lowered my voice \"-the Lord of the Vampaneze or a Master of Shadows?\"</p><p>She shook her head. \"He said only that we was all in for rough nights, and that there much fighting and dying would be before it became over.\" Then she started clipping again, and after that she measured me for the suit.</p>","<p>I was thinking hard about our conversation when I left Truska's van and went in search of Mr. Crepsley. It might be that, prompted by my concerns, my feet led me on purpose to Mr. Tall's van, or maybe it was accidental. Either way, I found myself hovering outside a few minutes later, pondering the situation and whether I should ask him about it.</p><p>As I stood, deliberating, the door opened and Mr. Tall and Evanna emerged. The witch was clad in a black cloak, almost invisible in the darkness of the cloudy night.</p><p>\"I wish you would not do this,\" Mr. Tall said. \"The vampires have been good friends to us. We should help them.\"</p><p>\"We cannot take sides, Hibernius,\" Evanna replied. \"It is not our place to decide the twists of fate.\"</p><p>\"Still,\" he muttered, his long face creased, \"to embrace these others and parlay with them... I don't like it.\"</p><p>\"We must remain neutral,\" she insisted. \"We have neither allies nor foes among the creatures of the night. If you or I took sides, we could destroy everything. As far as we're concerned, both must be equal, neither good nor bad.\"</p><p>\"You are correct,\" he sighed. \"I have spent too long with Larten. I'm letting my friendship for him cloud my judgement.\"</p><p>\"There's nothing wrong with befriending these beings,\" Evanna said. \"But we must not get personally involved, not until the future unravels and we have to.\"</p><p>With that, she kissed Mr. Tall on the cheek - I don't know how one so short reached all the way up to one so tall, but she did - and slipped away out of camp. Mr. Tall watched her go, an unhappy look on his face, then closed the door and went about his business.</p><p>I remained where I was a moment, replaying the strange conversation. I wasn't entirely sure what was going on, but I gathered that Evanna was about to do something which Mr. Tall didn't like - something that seemed to bode ill for vampires.</p><p>As a Prince, I should have waited for Evanna to come back and challenged her openly about the conversation. It wasn't proper for one of my standing to eavesdrop, and it would be positively rude to sneak out of camp after her. But politeness and good manners had never been high on my list of priorities. I'd rather have Evanna think less of me - even punish me for my insolence - and know what she was up to, than let her slip away and face a nasty surprise further down the line.</p><p>Kicking off my shoes, I hurried out of camp, spotted the top of her hooded head vanishing behind a tree in the distance - she was moving fast - and set off after her as quickly and quietly as I could.</p><p>It was hard keeping up with Evanna. She was swift and surefooted, leaving almost no trace of her passage. If the chase had endured, I'd have lost her, but she drew to a halt after three or four kilometres, stood breathing in the air a moment, then walked to a small copse of trees, whistled loudly, and entered.</p><p>I waited a few minutes to see if she'd emerge. When she didn't, I followed her to the edge of the copse and stood listening. When I heard nothing I slipped between the trees and advanced cautiously. The ground was damp and masked the sounds of my footsteps, but I took no chances: Evanna's sense of hearing was at least as sharp as a vampire's - one snapped twig would be enough to alert her to my presence.</p><p>As I progressed, the sound of soft talking reached me. There were several people up ahead, but they were speaking in hushed tones and I was too far away to hear what they were saying. With an increasing sense of unease I crept forward, and finally I was near enough to identify a group of shadowy figures at the heart of the copse.</p><p>I didn't move any closer, for fear I'd give myself away, but squatted, watched and listened. Their voices were muffled and only the occasional disconnected word or half-sentence came across. Their voices rose from time to time when they laughed, but even then they were careful not to laugh too loud.</p><p>My eyes gradually adjusted to the darkness and I was able to make some sense of the shapes. Apart from Evanna - whose shadow was impossible to mistake - I counted eight people, sitting, squatting or lying down. Seven were large and muscular. The eighth was slight, dressed in a hood and robes, serving drinks and food to the others. They all appeared to be men.</p><p>I could be no more certain than that, given the distance and darkness. Either I'd have to get a lot closer to learn more about them, or the moon would have to shine. Glancing up at the cloudy sky through the dense branches of the trees, I figured there wasn't much chance of that. Rising silently, I started to back away.</p><p>That's when the servant in the robes lit a candle.</p><p>\"Put that out, fool!\" one of the others barked, and a strong hand knocked the candle to the floor, where a foot roughly quenched it.</p><p>\"Sorry,\" the servant squeaked. \"I thought we were safe with Lady Evanna.\"</p><p>\"We're never safe,\" the burly man snapped. \"Remember that, and don't make such a mistake again.\"</p><p>The men fell back into conversation with Evanna, their voices low and impenetrable, but I was no longer interested in what they had to say. During the few seconds of candlelight, I'd glimpsed purple skin, red eyes and hair, and knew who and what the men were, and why Evanna had been so secretive - she'd come to meet with a group of vampaneze!</p><p>Chapter EIGHTEEN</p><p>RETREATING STEALTHILY, I cleared the copse. Seeing no guards, I rushed back to the Cirque Du Freak, pausing neither for breath nor thought. I reached the campsite ten minutes later, having raced as fast as my powers allowed.</p><p>The show had commenced and Mr. Crepsley was standing in what used to be the church's vestry, watching Rhamus Twobellies eat a tyre. He looked very dashing in his red suit, and he'd rubbed blood along the scar down the left side of his face, drawing attention to it, making him look more mysterious than usual.</p><p>\"Where have you been?\" he snapped as I entered, panting. \"I have looked all over for you. I thought I would have to perform alone. Truska has your pirate costume ready. If we hurry, we can-\"</p><p>\"Where's Vancha?\" I gasped.</p><p>\"Off sulking somewhere,\" Mr. Crepsley chuckled. \"He still has not-\"</p><p>\"Larten,\" I interrupted. He stopped, alerted to the danger by my rare use of his first name. \"Forget the show. We have to find Vancha. Now!\"</p><p>He asked no questions. Telling a stagehand to inform Mr. Tall of his withdrawal from the bill, he led me out to search for Vancha. We found him with Harkat in the tent I was sharing with the Little Person. He was teaching Harkat how to throw shurikens. Harkat was finding it difficult - his fingers were too large to easily grasp the small stars.</p>","<p>\"Look who it is,\" Vancha jeered as we entered. \"The king of the clowns and his head assistant. How's show business, boys?\"</p><p>I pulled the flap of the tent closed and sunk to my haunches. Vancha saw the serious expression in my eyes and put his shurikens away. Quickly and calmly, I told them what had happened. There was a pause when I finished, broken by Vancha, who let fly with a barbed stream of curses.</p><p>\"We shouldn't have trusted her,\" he snarled. \"Witches are treacherous by nature. She's probably selling us out to the vampaneze even as we speak.\"</p><p>\"I doubt that,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Evanna would hardly require the aid of the vampaneze if she meant to do us harm.\"</p><p>\"You think she's gone over there to discuss frogs?\" Vancha barked.</p><p>\"I do not know what they are discussing, but I do not believe she is betraying us,\" Mr. Crepsley said stubbornly.</p><p>\"Maybe we should ask Mr. Tall,\" Harkat suggested. \"From what Darren says, he knows what Evanna... is up to. Perhaps he would tell us.\"</p><p>Vancha looked at Mr. Crepsley. \"He's your friend. Should we try?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley shook his head. \"If Hibernius knew we were in danger, and was capable of warning or aiding us, he would have.\"</p><p>\"Very well,\" Vancha smiled grimly. \"We'll have to take them on ourselves.\" He stood and checked his supply of shurikens.</p><p>\"We're going to fight them?\" I asked, insides tightening.</p><p>\"We're hardly going to sit here and wait for them to attack!\" Vancha replied. \"The element of surprise is vital. While we have it, we must make use of it.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley looked troubled. \"Perhaps they do not mean to attack,\" he said. \"We only arrived last night. They could not have known we were coming. Their being here might have nothing to do with us.\"</p><p>\"Nonsense!\" Vancha howled. \"They're here to kill, and if we don't strike first, they'll be on us before-\"</p><p>\"I'm not so sure,\" I muttered. \"Now that I think about it, they weren't on guard or nervous, as they would have been if they were preparing for a fight.\"</p><p>Vancha cursed some more, then sat down again. \"OK. Let's say they aren't after us. Perhaps it's coincidence and they don't know we're here.\" He leant forward. \"But they will when Evanna's finished filling them in!\"</p><p>\"You think she'll tell them about us?\" I asked.</p><p>\"We'd be fools to chance it.\" He cleared his throat. \"In case you've forgotten, we're at war. I've nothing personal against our blood-cousins, but for the time being they're our enemies, and we must show them no mercy. Let's say these vampaneze and their servant have nothing to do with our being here. So what? It's our duty to engage them in battle and cut them down.\"</p><p>\"That's murder, not self-defence,\" Harkat said softly.</p><p>\"Aye,\" Vancha agreed. \"But would you rather we let them go on to murder some of our own? Our quest to find the Vampaneze Lord takes precedence over all else, but when the chance to cull a few stray vampaneze drops our way, we'd be fools - traitors! - not to seize it.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley sighed. \"And Evanna? What if she takes the side of the vampaneze against us?\"</p><p>\"Then we fight her too,\" Vancha sniffed.</p><p>\"You fancy your chances against her?\" Mr. Crepsley smiled thinly.</p><p>\"No. But I know my duty.\" He stood, and this time there was a certainty to his stance. \"I'm going to kill vampaneze. If you want to come, you can. If not...\" He shrugged.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley looked at me. \"What do you say, Darren?\"</p><p>\"Vancha's right,\" I said slowly. \"If we let them go, and they kill vampires later, we'd be to blame. Besides, there's something we're overlooking - the Lord of the Vampaneze.\" Mr. Crepsley and Vancha stared at me. \"We're destined to cross paths with him, but I think we have to chase that destiny. Maybe these vampaneze know where he is or will be. I doubt it's coincidence that we're here at the same time as them. This might be fate's way of leading us to him.\"</p><p>\"A solid argument,\" Vancha said.</p><p>\"Perhaps.\" Mr. Crepsley didn't sound convinced.</p><p>\"Remember Mr. Tiny's words?\" I said. \"To follow our hearts? My heart says we should face these vampaneze.\"</p><p>\"Mine too,\" Harkat said after a moment's hesitation.</p><p>\"And mine,\" Vancha added.</p><p>\"I thought you had no heart,\" Mr. Crepsley muttered, then stood. \"But my heart also demands confrontation, although my head disagrees. We will go.\"</p><p>Vancha grinned bloodthirstily and clapped Mr. Crepsley on the back, then without further ado we stole away into the night.</p><p>At the copse we made our plans.</p><p>\"We'll close on them from four different angles,\" Vancha said, taking charge. \"That way well make them think there are more of us.\"</p><p>\"There are nine of them in all,\" Mr. Crepsley noted, \"including Evanna. How do we divide them up?\"</p><p>\"Two vampaneze for you, two for me, two for Harkat. Darren takes the seventh and the servant - he's probably a half-vampaneze or vampet, so he shouldn't pose too much of a problem.\"</p><p>\"And Evanna?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"We could all rush her at the end,\" Vancha suggested.</p><p>\"No,\" Mr. Crepsley decided. \"I will handle her.\"</p><p>\"You re sure?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley nodded.</p><p>\"Then all that's left is to split up and move in. Get as close as you can. I'll start by launching a couple of shurikens. I'll aim for arms and legs. Once you hear screams and curses - hit them hard.\"</p><p>\"Things would go much smoother if you aimed for throats and heads,\" I noted.</p><p>\"I don't fight that way,\" Vancha growled. \"Only cowards kill a foe without facing him. If I have to - as when killing the vampet with the hand grenade - I will, but I prefer to fight cleanly.\"</p><p>The four of us split up and circled the trees, entering the copse at different points. I felt vulnerable and small when I found myself alone in the woods, but quickly thrust such feelings aside and concentrated on my mission. \"May the gods of the vampires guide and protect us,\" I muttered under my breath, before advancing, sword drawn.</p><p>The vampaneze and Evanna were still in the clearing at the heart of the copse, talking softly. The moon had broken through the clouds, and although the overhanging branches kept most of the light out, the area was brighter than it had been when I was here before.</p>","<p>Easing forward, I got as close to the vampaneze as I dared, then pulled up behind a thick trunk and waited. All was silent around me. I'd thought Harkat might alert them to our presence - he couldn't move as quietly as a vampire - but the Little Person was taking great care and made no sound.</p><p>I started to count, silently, inside my head. I was up to ninety-six when there was a sharp whistling hiss to my far left, followed by a startled shriek. Less than a second later, another whistle and another scream. Gripping my sword tight, I swung around the tree and darted forward, roaring wildly.</p><p>The vampaneze were quick to react, and were on their feet, weapons in hand, by the time I reached them. Fast as they were, Mr. Crepsley and Vancha were faster, and as I locked swords with a tall, muscular vampaneze, from whose left shin stuck a silver shuriken, I saw Mr. Crepsley cut open the stomach and chest of one of our opponents, killing him instantly, while Vancha's thumb took out the left eye of another - he dropped to the ground, wailing.</p><p>I had just enough time to note that the man on the ground wasn't purple-skinned like the rest - a vampet! - then I had to concentrate on the vampaneze in front of me. He was at least two heads taller then me, broader and stronger. But size, as I'd been taught in Vampire Mountain, wasn't everything, and while he lashed out at me with savage strokes, I jabbed and feinted, nicking him here, poking him there, drawing blood, enraging him, spoiling his aim and rhythm, causing him to swing erratically.</p><p>As I parried one of his blows, someone stumbled into my back and I tumbled to the ground. Rolling over swiftly, I jumped to my feet and saw a bloody-faced vampaneze fall, gasping for breath. Harkat Mulds stood over him, a red-stained axe in his left hand, an injured right arm hanging limp by his side.</p><p>The vampaneze who'd been attacking me now focused on Harkat. With a bellow he swung at the Little Persons head. Harkat brought his axe up just in time, knocked the sword up high of its mark, then stepped back, tempting the vampaneze forward.</p><p>I looked around quickly, taking in the state of play. Three of our foes were down, although the vampet who'd lost his eye was scrabbling about for a sword and looked ready to rejoin the action. Mr. Crepsley was battling a vampaneze who favoured knives, and the two were swinging around and slicing at each other like a pair of whirling dancers. Vancha had his hands full with a huge, axe-wielding brute. His axe was twice the size of Harkat's, yet he rolled it about between his immense fingers as if it weighed nothing. Vancha was sweating, and bleeding from a cut to his waist, but he wasn't conceding any ground.</p><p>Across from me, the seventh vampaneze - tall, slim, with a smooth face, long hair tied back, dressed in a light green suit - and the hooded servant were watching the fighting. Both clutched long swords and stood ready to flee if the battle seemed lost, or dive in and finish things off if they sensed victory. Such cynical tactics disgusted me, and drawing a knife, I sent it whizzing at the head of the servant, who wasn't much bigger than me.</p><p>The small man in the robes saw the knife and twitched his head out of the path of its flight. By his swiftness, I knew he must be a blooded creature of the night - no human could have moved so quickly.</p><p>The vampaneze next to the servant scowled as I drew another knife, paused a moment, then darted across the clearing before I could take aim. Dropping the knife, I raised my sword and turned his blow aside, but only barely managed to get it up in time to deflect his second strike. He was fast and well-trained in the ways of war. I was in trouble.</p><p>I backed away from the vampaneze, protecting myself as best I could. The tip of his sword became a blur as it struck, and though I defended myself ably, his blade soon bit. I felt a wound open on the top of my left arm... a deep gash to my right thigh... a jagged scratch across my chest.</p><p>I backed up against a tree and caught the sleeve of my right arm on a branch. The vampaneze thrust his sword at my face. I thought the end had come, but then my arm tore free and my sword came across to block his and drive it towards the ground. I pushed down with my sword, hoping to make my foe drop his weapon, but he was too strong and brought his sword up in a smooth reverse movement. His blade slid up the length of mine, giving birth to a shower of sparks. It was moving so fast, and there was so much force behind it, that instead of being routed away by the hilt of my sword when it got there, it cut clean through the gold casing - and clean through the flesh and bone of my sticking-out right thumb!</p><p>I screamed as my thumb shot away into the darkness. My sword dropped from my fingers and I fell, defenceless. The vampaneze glanced around casually, dismissing me as a threat. Mr. Crepsley was winning the war of the knives - his opponent's face had been slashed to ribbons. Harkat had defied the handicap of his injured arm and buried the tip of his axe deep in his vampaneze's stomach - though the vampaneze bellowed valiantly and fought on, he was surely lost. Vancha was struggling with his opponent, but was holding his own, and when Mr. Crepsley or Harkat came to his aid, their combined force would be enough to make an end of the giant. The vampet who'd lost an eye was on his feet, sword in hand, but was swaying unsteadily and wouldn't pose much of a problem.</p><p>While all this was happening, Evanna had remained seated on the ground, a neutral look on her face, taking no part in the fighting.</p><p>We were going to win and the vampaneze in the green suit knew it. Snarling, he swung once more at my head - aiming to cut it clean off at the neck - but I rolled out of his way, into a pile of leaves. Rather than duck after me to finish me off, he about-faced, ran to where the robed servant was standing, grabbed a spare sword from the ground, then hurried through the trees, pushing the servant ahead of him.</p><p>Getting to my feet, I moaned loudly from the pain, then gritted my teeth against it, picked up the knife I'd dropped earlier, and moved in to help Harkat finish off his vampaneze. It wasn't noble, sticking a knife into a warrior's back, but all I cared about was ending the battle, and I felt no pity for the vampaneze when he stiffened and collapsed, my blade buried deep between his shoulder blades.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley had dispatched the vampaneze with the knives, and after taking care of the one-eyed vampet - a swift cut to his throat - he started forward to help Vancha. That's when Evanna stood and called to him. \"Will you raise your blades to me too, Larten?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley hesitated, knives hovering in his hands, then dropped his guard and went on one knee before her. \"Nay, Lady,\" he sighed. \"I will not.\"</p><p>\"Then I will not raise a hand to you,\" she said, and commenced walking from one dead vampaneze to another, kneeling beside them, making the death's touch, whispering, \"Even in death may you be triumphant.\"</p>","<p>Mr. Crepsley got to his feet and studied Vancha as he battled the largest of the vampaneze. \"A close call, Sire,\" he noted dryly as the giant barely missed the top of Vancha's scalp with his huge war axe. Vancha honoured Mr. Crepsley with one of his foulest curses in reply. \"Would you be offended if I offered my assistance, Sire?\" Mr. Crepsley asked politely.</p><p>\"Get over here quick!\" Vancha snarled. \"Two are getting away. We have to- Charna's guts!\" he yelled, again only barely dodging the head of the axe.</p><p>\"Harkat, stay with me,\" Mr. Crepsley said, moving forward to intercept the giant. \"Darren, go with Vancha after the others.\"</p><p>\"Right,\" I said. I didn't mention the fact that I was missing a thumb - such considerations were nothing in the heat of life or death battle.</p><p>As Mr. Crepsley and Harkat engaged the giant, Vancha swung away, paused for breath, then nodded for me to follow as he raced after the vampaneze and the servant. I kept close to him, sucking on the bloody stump where my thumb used to be, grabbing a knife from my belt with my left hand. As we broke from the trees, we saw the pair ahead. The servant was climbing on to the vampaneze's back - it was clear that they were planning to flit.</p><p>\"No you don't!\" Vancha growled, and sent a dark shuriken flying. It struck the servant high above the right shoulder blade. He cried out and toppled off the vampaneze's back. The vampaneze spun, stooped to pick up his fallen comrade, saw Vancha closing in, and jumped to his feet, pulling a sword and moving forward. I hung back, not wanting to get in Vancha's way, keeping an eye on the fallen servant, waiting to see how the fight progressed.</p><p>Vancha was almost within striking distance of the vampaneze when he drew up short, as though injured. I thought he must have been hit with something - a knife or arrow - but he didn't look hurt. He just stood, arms outstretched, staring at the vampaneze. The vampaneze was motionless too, his red eyes wide, his dark purple face incredulous. Then he lowered his sword, slid it into its scabbard, turned and picked up the servant.</p><p>Vancha did nothing to stop him.</p><p>Behind me I heard Mr. Crepsley and Harkat break free of the trees. They raced forward, then stopped by my side when they saw the vampaneze escaping, Vancha standing by and watching.</p><p>\"What the-\" Mr. Crepsley began, but then the vampaneze hit flitting speed and disappeared.</p><p>Vancha looked back at us, then sank to the ground. Mr. Crepsley cursed - not quite as foul as Vancha's earlier outburst, but close - and sheathed his knives in disgust. \"You let them escape!\" he shouted. Striding forward, he stood over Vancha and regarded him with undisguised contempt. \"Why?\" he growled, hands bunched into fists.</p><p>\"I couldn't stop him,\" Vancha whispered, eyes downcast.</p><p>\"You did not even try!\" Mr. Crepsley roared.</p><p>\"I couldn't fight him,\" Vancha said. \"I always feared this night would come. I prayed it wouldn't, but part of me knew it would.\"</p><p>\"You are not making sense!\" Mr. Crepsley snapped. \"Who was that vampaneze? Why did you let him escape?\"</p><p>\"His name is Gannen Harst,\" Vancha said in a low, broken voice. He looked up and there were hard, glittering tears in his eyes. \"He's my brother.?</p><p>Chapter NINETEEN</p><p>FOR Along time nothing was said. Harkat, Mr. Crepsley and me stared at Vancha, whose eyes were fixed on the ground. Overhead the moon had vanished behind thick banks of cloud. When they finally parted, Vancha began to talk, as though prompted by the moonbeams.</p><p>\"My real name's Vancha Harst,\" he said. \"I changed it when I became a vampire. Gannen's a year or two younger than me - or is it the other way round? It's been so long, I can't remember. We were very close growing up. We did everything together - including joining the vampaneze.</p><p>\"The vampaneze who blooded us was an honest man and a good teacher. He told us exactly what our lives would be like. He explained their ways and beliefs, how they looked upon themselves as the guardians of history by keeping alive the memories of those they drank from.\" (If a vampire or vampaneze drains a person's blood, he absorbs part of their spirit and memories.) \"He said vampaneze killed when they drank, but did it swiftly and painlessly.\"</p><p>\"That makes it OK?\" I snorted.</p><p>\"To the vampaneze, yes,\" Vancha said.</p><p>\"How can you-\" I started to explode.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley stopped me with a soft wave of his hand. \"This is not the time for a moral debate. Let Vancha talk.\"</p><p>\"There's not a whole lot more to tell,\" Vancha said. \"Gannen and I were blooded as half-vampaneze. We served together for a few years as assistants. I couldn't accustom myself to the killing. So I quit.\"</p><p>\"As simply as that?\" Mr. Crepsley asked sceptically.</p><p>\"No,\" Vancha said. \"The vampaneze normally don't permit assistants to live if they choose to part company with the clan. No vampaneze will kill one of his own, but that law doesn't apply to a half-vampaneze. My master should have killed me when I said I wanted out.</p><p>\"Gannen saved me. He pleaded for my life. When that failed, he said our master would have to kill him also. In the end my life was spared, but I was warned to avoid all vampaneze in future, including Gannen, whom I never saw again until tonight.</p><p>\"For several years I lived miserably. I tried feeding as vampires do, not killing those I fed upon, but vampaneze blood exerts a powerful hold. I'd lose control when I fed, and kill in spite of myself. In the end I made up my mind not to feed at all, and die. It was then that I met Paris Skyle, who took me under his wing.\"</p><p>\"Paris blooded you?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"Even though he knew what you were?\"</p><p>Vancha nodded.</p><p>\"But how can you blood someone as a vampire if he's already been blooded as a vampaneze?\" I asked.</p><p>\"It is possible for those who are not fully blooded,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"A half-vampire can become a vampaneze, and vice versa, but it is dangerous and rarely attempted. I know of only three other cases - and twice it ended in death, for both the blooder and the blooded.\"</p><p>\"Paris knew the risks,\" Vancha said, \"but didn't tell me about them until afterwards. I wouldn't have gone through with it if I'd known his life was in danger.\"</p><p>\"What did he have to do?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"Take my blood and give me his, the same as any ordinary blooding,\" Vancha said. \"The only difference was, half my blood was vampaneze, which is poisonous to vampires. Paris took my tainted blood, and his body's natural defences broke it down and rendered it harmless. But it could have easily killed him, just as his blood could have killed me. But the luck of the vampires was with us - we both survived, though our agonies were great.</p>","<p>\"With my vampaneze blood transformed by Paris's blood, I was able to control my feeding urges. I studied under Paris and in time trained to be a General. My vampaneze links were revealed to no one except the other Princes.\"</p><p>\"They approved of your blooding?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.</p><p>\"After I'd proven myself many times - yes. They worried about Gannen - they were afraid my loyalties would be divided if I met him again, as they have been tonight - but they accepted me and vowed to keep my true history a secret.\"</p><p>\"Why wasn't I told about you?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Had I come to Vampire Mountain while you were there, you would have been told. But it's impolite to speak of one when he's absent.\"</p><p>\"This is damned frustrating,\" Mr. Crepsley grunted. \"I understand why you did not speak of it before, but if we had known, I could have gone after your brother and left you to take care of that giant in the trees.\"</p><p>\"How was I to know?\" Vancha smiled weakly. \"I didn't see his face until I was moving in for the kill. He was the last person I expected to run into.\"</p><p>Behind us, Evanna emerged from between the trees. Her hands were red with the blood of dead vampaneze. She was carrying something. As she got closer, I realized it was my missing thumb. \"Found this,\" she said, tossing it to me. \"Thought you might like it back.\"</p><p>I caught the thumb, then looked down at the stump where it had been cut off. I hadn't been aware of the pain while listening to Vancha talk, but now the throbbing intensified. \"Can we stitch it back on?\" I winced.</p><p>\"Possibly,\" Mr. Crepsley said, examining the stump and thumb. \"Lady Evanna - you have the power to connect it immediately and effortlessly, do you not?\"</p><p>\"I do,\" Evanna agreed, \"but I won't. Snoops don't deserve special favours.\" She wagged a finger at me. \"You should have been a spy, Darren.\" It was hard to tell whether she was annoyed or amused.</p><p>Vancha had string and a needle made from fish bone, and while Mr. Crepsley held my thumb in place, the Prince stitched it back on, even though his thoughts were elsewhere. It hurt tremendously, but I just had to look away and grit my teeth. The stitching completed, the vampires rubbed their spit around the join, to quicken the healing process, strapped the thumb tight to my fingers so that the bones could fuse, then let me be.</p><p>\"That is the best we can do,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"If it gets infected, we will chop it off again and you will have to make do without.\"</p><p>\"That's right,\" I growled. \"Look on the bright side.\"</p><p>\"It's my head you should be chopping off,\" Vancha said bitterly. \"I should have put duty before kinship. I don't deserve to live.\"</p><p>\"Nonsense!\" Mr. Crepsley huffed. \"Any man who would strike a brother is no man at all. You did what any of us would have done. It is unfortunate that you ran into him now, but we have not been harmed by your slip, and I think-\"</p><p>He stopped at a sudden burst of laughter from Evanna. The witch was giggling wildly, as if he'd cracked a great joke.</p><p>\"Did I say something funny?\" Mr. Crepsley asked, bemused.</p><p>\"Oh, Larten, if only you knew!\" she squealed.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at Vancha, Harkat and me. \"What is she laughing at?\"</p><p>None of us knew.</p><p>\"Never mind why she's laughing,\" Vancha said, stepping forward to confront the witch. \"I want to know what she was doing here in the first place, and why she was consorting with the enemy while pretending to be our ally.\"</p><p>Evanna stopped laughing and faced Vancha. She grew magically, until she was towering over him like a coiled cobra, but the Prince didn't flinch. Gradually the menace drained out of her and she resorted to her standard shape. \"I never claimed to be your ally, Vancha,\" she said. \"I travelled with you, and broke bread with you - but I never said I was on your side.\"</p><p>\"Does that mean you're on theirs!\" he snarled.</p><p>\"I take nobody's side,\" she replied coolly. \"The divide between vampires and vampaneze is of no interest to me. I look upon you as silly, warring boys, who will one night come to their senses and stop spitting angrily at one another.\"</p><p>\"An interesting view,\" Mr. Crepsley remarked ironically.</p><p>\"I don't understand,\" I said. \"If you aren't on their side, what were you doing with them?\"</p><p>\"Conversing,\" she said. \"Taking their measure, as I did with you. I've sat with the hunters and studied them. Now I've done likewise with the hunted. Whichever way the War of the Scars goes, I'll have to deal with the victors. It's good to know in advance the calibre of those to whom your future is tied.\"</p><p>\"Can anyone make sense of this?\" Vancha asked.</p><p>Evanna smirked, delighted by our confusion. \"Do you fine, fighting gentlemen read mystery novels?\" she asked. We stared at her blankly. \"If you did, you'd have guessed by now what's going on.\"</p><p>\"Have you ever hit a woman?\" Vancha asked Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>\"No,\" he said.</p><p>\"I have,\" Vancha grunted.</p><p>\"Temper,\" the witch giggled, then grew serious. \"If you have something that is precious, and others are looking for it, where is the best place to hide it?\"</p><p>\"If this rubbish continues...\"Vancha warned.</p><p>\"It's not rubbish,\" Evanna said. \"Even humans know the answer to this one.\"</p><p>We thought about it in silence. Then I raised a hand, as though in school, and said, \"Out in the open, in front of everyone?\"</p><p>\"Exactly,\" Evanna applauded. \"People searching - or hunting - rarely find what they seek if it's placed directly before them. It's common to overlook that which is most obvious.\"</p><p>\"What does any of this have to do with-\" Mr. Crepsley began.</p><p>\"The man in the robes... was no servant,\" Harkat interrupted grimly. Our heads turned questioningly. \"That's what we overlooked... wasn't it?\"</p><p>\"Precisely,\" the witch said, and now there was a touch of sympathy to her tone. \"By dressing and treating him as a servant - as they have since they took to the road - the vampaneze knew he'd be the last target anyone would focus on in the event of an attack.\" Holding up four fingers, Evanna slowly bent the index one over, and said, \"Your brother didn't run because he was afraid, Vancha. He fled to save the life of the man he was protecting - the fake servant - the Lord of the Vampaneze!\"</p>","<p>Chapter TWENTY</p><p>UNDER ORDERS from Evanna - she threatened to blind and deafen us if we disobeyed - we buried the dead vampaneze and vampet in the copse, digging deep graves and placing them on their backs, facing towards the sky and Paradise, before covering them over.</p><p>Vancha was inconsolable. On our return to the Cirque Du Freak, he demanded a bottle of brandy, then locked himself away in a small trailer and refused to answer our calls. He blamed himself for the escape of the Vampaneze Lord. If he'd tackled his brother, the Vampaneze Lord would have been at our mercy. It was the first of our four promised chances to kill him, and it was hard to imagine a simpler opportunity falling into our laps.</p><p>Mr. Tall already knew what had happened. He'd been expecting the confrontation and told us that the vampaneze had been trailing the Cirque Du Freak for more than a month.</p><p>\"They knew we were coming?\" I asked.</p><p>\"No,\" he said. \"They were following us for other reasons.\"</p><p>\"But you knew we were coming... didn't you?\" Harkat challenged him.</p><p>Mr. Tall nodded sadly. \"I'd have warned you, but the consequences would have been dire. Those with insight into the future are forbidden to influence it. Only Desmond Tiny, can meddle directly in the affairs of time.\"</p><p>\"Do you know where they have gone,\" Mr. Crepsley asked, \"or when we are due to clash with them again?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Mr. Tall said. \"I could find out, but I read the future as little as possible. What I can tell you is that Gannen Harst is prime protector of the Lord of the Vampaneze. The six you killed were normal guards who can be replaced. Harst is the key guardian. Where the Lord goes, he goes too. Had he been killed, the odds of future success would have weighed heavily on your side.\"</p><p>\"If only I had gone after Harst instead of Vancha,\" Mr. Crepsley sighed.</p><p>Evanna, who'd said nothing since we returned, shook her head. \"Don't waste time regretting lost chances,\" she said. \"You weren't destined to face Gannen Harst at this stage of the hunt. Vancha was. It was fate.\"</p><p>\"Let's be positive,\" I said. \"We now know who the Vampaneze Lord is travelling with. We can spread Gannen Harst's description and tell our people to look out for him. And they won't be able to pull that servant disguise again - next time we'll be ready and know who to look for.\"</p><p>\"This is true,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed. \"Plus we have suffered no losses. We are as strong as we were at the start of our quest, we are wiser, and we still have three chances to kill him.\"</p><p>\"Then why do we feel... so terrible?\" Harkat asked glumly.</p><p>\"Failure is always a bitter pill to swallow,\" Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>We saw to our wounds after that. Harkat's arm was badly cut but no bones were broken. We set it in a sling, and Mr. Crepsley said it would be fine in a couple of nights. My right thumb was turning an ugly colour, but Mr. Tall said it wasn't infected and would be OK if I rested it.</p><p>We were preparing for sleep when we heard angry bellows. Hurrying through the camp - Mr. Crepsley with a heavy cloak tossed over his head to protect him from the morning sun - we found Vancha on the outskirts, tearing off his clothes, an empty bottle of brandy on the ground beside him, screaming at the sun. \"Roast me!\" he challenged it. \"I don't care! Do your worst! See if I give a-\"</p><p>\"Vancha!\" Mr. Crepsley snapped. \"What are you doing?\"</p><p>Vancha whirled, snatched up the bottle and pointed it at Mr. Crepsley as though it was a knife. \"Stay away!\" he hissed. \"I'll kill you if you try to stop me!\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley came to a halt. He knew better than to mess with a drunken vampire, especially one of Vancha's powers. \"This is stupid, Sire,\" he said. \"Come inside. We will find another bottle of brandy and help you drink-\"</p><p>\"- to the health of the Vampaneze Lord!\" Vancha shrieked crazily.</p><p>\"Sire, this is madness,\" Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>\"Aye,\" Vancha agreed in a sadder, sober tone. \"But this is a mad world, Larten. Because I spared the life of my brother - who once saved mine - our greatest enemy has escaped and our people face defeat. What sort of a world is it where evil is born of an act of goodness?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley had no answer for that.</p><p>\"Dying will not help, Vancha,\" Harkat said. \"I should know.\"</p><p>\"It won't help,\" Vancha agreed, \"but it will punish, and I deserve to be punished. How could I face my fellow Princes and Generals after this? My chance to kill the Lord of the Vampaneze has passed. Better I pass with it than linger and shame us all.\"</p><p>\"So you plan on staying out here and letting the sun kill you?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Aye,\" he chuckled.</p><p>\"You're a coward,\" I sneered.</p><p>His expression hardened. \"Take heed, Darren Shan - I'm in the mood to crack a few skulls before I die!\"</p><p>\"And a fool,\" I pressed on, regardless. I stormed past Mr. Crepsley and pointed accusingly at Vancha with my good left hand. \"Who gave you the right to quit? What makes you think you can abandon the quest and damn us all?\"</p><p>\"What are you talking about?\" he stammered, confused. \"I'm no longer part of the quest. It's up to you and Larten now.\"</p><p>\"Is it?\" Turning, I searched for Evanna and Mr. Tall. I found them together, behind the crowd of circus performers and assistants which had been attracted by the howls of the Prince. \"Lady Evanna. Mr. Tall. Answer if you may - does Vancha still have a part to play in the hunt for the Vampaneze Lord?\"</p><p>Mr. Tall shared an uneasy glance with Evanna. She hesitated, then said grudgingly, \"He has the power to influence the quest.\"</p><p>\"But I failed,\" Vancha said, bewildered.</p><p>\"Once,\" I agreed. \"But who's to say you won't have another chance? Nobody said we'd have one chance each. For all we know, all four opportunities are destined to fall to you!\"</p><p>Vancha blinked, and his mouth slowly opened.</p><p>\"Even if the chances are to be shared evenly,\" Mr. Crepsley chipped in, \"there are a further three to go, and Darren and I are only two - therefore one of us must be destined to face the Vampaneze Lord twice if it goes down to the final encounter.\"</p><p>Vancha wavered on his feet, considering our words, then dropped the bottle and stumbled towards me. I caught and steadied him. \"I've been an idiot, haven't I?\" he groaned.</p>","<p>\"Yes,\" I agreed, smiling, then led him back into the shade, where he joined us in slumber until the darkening of night.</p><p>We arose with the sinking of the sun and gathered in Mr. Tall's van. As dusk deepened, and Vancha drank mug after mug of steaming hot coffee to cure his hangover, we debated our next move and decided it would be for the best if we left the Cirque Du Freak. I would have liked to stay on longer, and so would Mr. Crepsley, but our destiny lay elsewhere. Besides, Gannen Harst might return with an army of vampaneze, and we didn't want to find ourselves boxed in, or bring the wrath of our foes down upon the circus folk.</p><p>Evanna would not be travelling with us. The witch told us she was returning to her cave and frogs, to prepare for the tragedies to come. \"And there will be tragedies,\" she said, a sparkle in her brown and green eyes. \"Whether for the vampires or vampaneze, I don't yet know. But it must end in tears for one set, that much is certain.\"</p><p>I can't say I missed the short, hairy, ugly witch when she left - her dark predictions had brought nothing but gloom into our lives, and I thought we were better off without her.</p><p>Vancha would also be departing by himself. We'd agreed that he should return to Vampire Mountain and tell the others of our encounter with the Lord of the Vampaneze. They needed to know about Gannen Harst. Vancha would link up with us again later, by tracking Mr. Crepsley's mental waves.</p><p>We bid short farewells to our friends at the Cirque Du Freak. Evra was sad that I had to leave so soon, but he knew my life was complicated. Shancus was even sadder - it would be his birthday soon and he'd been anticipating a wonderful present. I told the snake-boy I'd find something exciting on the road and send it to him - although I couldn't guarantee it would reach him in time for his birthday - and that cheered him up.</p><p>Truska asked if I wanted to take my newly tailored pirate costume with me. I told her to hang on to it - it would only get stained and torn during my travels. I swore I'd be back to try it out. She said I'd better, then treated me to a long goodbye kiss which had Vancha seething with jealousy.</p><p>Mr. Tall met us at the edge of camp as we were about to leave. \"Sorry I couldn't come earlier,\" he said. \"Business to deal with. The show must go on.\"</p><p>\"Take care, Hibernius,\" Mr. Crepsley said, shaking the tall man's hand. For once Mr. Tall didn't shirk away from the contact.</p><p>\"You too, Larten,\" he replied, a grave expression on his face. Looking around at us, he said, \"Dark times lie ahead, regardless of the outcome of your quest. I want you to know that there will always be a home for you - all of you - here at the Cirque Du Freak. I can't play as active a part in the deciding of the future as I wish, but I can offer sanctuary.\"</p><p>We thanked him for his offer, then watched as he walked away and was swallowed by the shadows of his beloved circus camp.</p><p>Facing each other, we hesitated, reluctant to part.</p><p>\"Well!\" Vancha boomed eventually. \"Time I was off. It's a long trek to Vampire Mountain, even when flitting.\" Vampires weren't supposed to flit on the way to the mountain fortress, but the rules had been relaxed during wartime to allow for quicker communication between Generals and Princes.</p><p>Each of us shook Vancha's hand. I felt miserable at the thought of parting with the red-skinned, sun-fighting Prince. \"Cheer up,\" he laughed at my gloomy expression. \"I'll be back in time to lead the second charge against the Vampaneze Lord. You have my word, and Vancha March never broke...\" He paused. \"'March' or 'Harst'?\" he mused aloud, then spat into the dirt at his feet. \"Charna's guts! I've gone this long as Vancha March - I'll stick with it.\"</p><p>Saluting, he turned abruptly and jogged away. Soon he was running. Then, in a flash, he hit flitting speed and was lost to sight.</p><p>\"And then there were three,\" Mr. Crepsley muttered, gazing at Harkat and me.</p><p>\"Back where we started six years ago,\" I said.</p><p>\"But we had a destination then,\" Harkat noted. \"Where are we going... this time?\"</p><p>I looked to Mr. Crepsley for an answer.</p><p>He shrugged. \"We can decide later. For now, let us simply walk.\"</p><p>Hoisting our bags on to our backs, we spared the Cirque Du Freak one last, lingering glimpse, then faced the cold, unwelcoming darkness and set forth, surrendering ourselves to the forces of destiny and future terrors of the night.</p>"]},{"title":"Allies of the Night","pages":["<p>PROLOGUE</p><p>IT WAS an age of war. After six hundred years of peace, the vampires and vampaneze had taken up arms against each other in a brutal, bloody battle to the death. The War of the Scars began with the coming of the Lord of the Vampaneze. He was destined to lead his people to total, all-conquering victory - unless killed before he was fully blooded.</p><p>According to the mysterious and powerful Mr. Tiny, only three vampires stood a chance of stopping the Vampaneze Lord. They were the Prince, Vancha March; the one-time General, Larten Crepsley; and a half-vampire, me - Darren Shan.</p><p>It was predicted by Mr. Tiny that our path would cross four times with that of the Vampaneze Lord, and each time the destiny of the vampires would be ours for the making. If we killed him, we'd win the War of the Scars. If not, the vampaneze would cruise to savage victory and wipe our entire clan from the face of the earth.</p><p>Mr. Tiny said we couldn't call upon other vampires for help during the quest, but we could accept the aid of non-vampires. Thus, when Mr. Crepsley and me left Vampire Mountain (Vancha joined us later), the only one to come with us was Harkat Mulds, a stunted, grey-skinned Little Person.</p><p>Leaving the Mountain - our home for six years - we headed for the cave of Lady Evanna, a witch of great power. She could see into the future but would only reveal this much to us - if we failed to kill the Lord of the Vampaneze, by the end of our quest, two of us would be dead.</p><p>Later on, we linked up with the Cirque Du Freak, where I'd lived with Mr. Crepsley when I originally became his assistant. Evanna travelled with us. At the Cirque, we ran into a group of vampaneze. A short fight ensued, during which most of the vampaneze were killed. Two escaped - a full-vampaneze by the name of Gannen Harst, and his servant, who we later learnt was the Lord of the Vampaneze, in disguise.</p><p>We were sickened when Evanna revealed the true identity of Gannen Harst's servant, but Vancha was especially miserable, because he had let them escape - Gannen Harst was Vancha's brother, and Vancha had let him go without challenging him, unaware that his brother was prime protector of the Vampaneze Lord.</p><p>But there was no time to sit around feeling sorry for ourselves. We still had three chances to find and kill our deadly foe, so our quest continued. Putting the lost chance behind us, we sharpened our blades, parted company with Evanna and our friends in the Cirque Du Freak, and took to the road again, more determined than ever to succeed...</p><p>Chapter ONE</p><p>OUR DAILY POST, SEPTEMBER 15</p><p>BLOODY NIGHTS OF DEATH!!!</p><p>This once-sleepy city is under siege. In the space of six short months eleven people have been brutally murdered, their bodies drained of blood and dumped in various public places. Many more have vanished into the shadows of the night and might be lying beneath the streets, their lifeless bodies decomposing in the lonely dark.</p><p>Officials cannot account for the gruesome killing spree. They do not believe the murders to be the work of one man, but nor have they been able to link the crimes to any known criminals. In the largest single police operation in the city's history, most local gangs have been broken up, religious cult leaders arrested and the doors of secret orders and brotherhoods smashed down... to no effect at all!</p><p>CUSTOMARY BLUNTNESS</p><p>Chief Inspector of police, Alice Burgess, when queried about the lack of results, responded with her own brand of customary bluntness. \"We've been working like dogs,\" she snapped. \"Everyone's on unpaid overtime. Nobody's shirking responsibility. We're patrolling the streets in force, arresting anyone who even looks suspicious. We've initiated a 7 pm curfew for children, and have advised adults to remain indoors too. If you find someone who can do a better job, give me a call and I'll gladly step aside.\"</p><p>Comforting words - but nobody here is taking comfort from them. The people of this city are tired of promises and pledges. Nobody doubts the honest, hard-working efforts of the local police - or the army who have been called in to assist in the operation - but faith in their ability to bring an end to the crisis has hit an all-time low. Many are moving out of the city, staying with relatives or in hotels, until the killings cease.</p><p>\"I have kids,\" Michael Corbett, the forty-six-year-old owner of a second-hand bookshop told us. \"Running away doesn't make me feel proud, and it'll ruin my business, but the lives of my wife and children come first. The police can do no more now than they did thirteen years ago. We've just got to wait for this to blow over, like it did before. When it does, I'll return. In the mean time, I think anyone who stays is crazy.\"</p><p>HISTORY OF DEATH</p><p>When Mr. Corbett spoke of the past, he was referring to a time, nearly thirteen years ago, when horror similarly visited this city. On that occasion, nine bodies were discovered by a pair of teenagers, butchered and drained as the recent eleven victims have been.</p><p>But those bodies were carefully hidden, and only unearthed long after death had occurred. Today's murderers - rather, tonight's, since each victim has been taken after sunset - are not bothering to hide the evidence of their foul deeds. It's as though they are proud of their cruelty, leaving the bodies where they know they will be found.</p><p>Many locals believe the city is cursed and has a history of death. \"I've been expecting these killings for fifty years,\" said Dr. Kevin Beisty, a local historian and expert on the occult. \"Vampires visited here more than one hundred and fifty years ago, and the thing about vampires is, once they find a place they like - they always come back!\"</p><p>DEMONS OF THE NIGHT</p><p>Vampires. If Dr. Beisty's was the only voice crying out against demons of the night, he could be dismissed as a crank. But many other people believe that we are suffering at the hands of vampires. They point to the fact that the attacks always occur at night, that the bodies have been drained of blood - seemingly without the aid of medical equipment - and, most tellingly, that although three of the victims were photographed by hidden security cameras when they were abducted, their attackers' faces did not show up on film!!</p><p>Chief Inspector Alice Burgess is dismissive of the vampire theory. \"You think Count Dracula's on the rampage?\" she laughed contemptuously. \"Don't be ridiculous! This is the twenty-first century. Warped, sick humans are behind all this. Don't waste my time blaming bogeymen!\"</p><p>When pushed, the Chief inspector had this to add: \"I don't believe in vampires, and I don't want idiots like you filling people's heads with such nonsense. But I'll tell you this: I'll do whatever it takes to stop these savages. If that means driving a stake through some madman's chest because he believes he's a vampire, I'll do it, even if it costs me my job and freedom. Nobody's walking away from this on an insanity plea. There's only one way to pay back the deaths of eleven good men and women - extermination!</p>","<p>\"And I'll do it,\" Chief Inspector Burgess vowed, a fiery gleam in her pale eyes which would have done Professor Van Helsing proud. \"Even if I have to track them to Transylvania and back. There'll be no escaping the sword of justice, be they humans or vampires.</p><p>\"Tell your readers that I'll get their tormentors. They can bet on that. They can bet their lives ...\"</p><p>MR. CREPSLEY pushed the manhole cover up and out of the way, while Harkat and me waited in the darkness below. After checking the street for signs of life, he whispered, \"All clear,\" and we followed him up the ladder and out into fresh air.</p><p>\"I hate those bloody tunnels,\" I groaned, slipping off my shoes, which were soaked through with water, mud and other things I didn't want to think about. I'd have to wash them out in the sink when we got back to the hotel and leave them on top of a radiator to dry, as I'd been doing at the end of every night for the past three months.</p><p>\"I despise them too,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed, gently prying the remains of a dead rat from the folds of his long red cloak.</p><p>\"They're not so bad,\" Harkat chuckled. It was OK for him - he had no nose or sense of smell!</p><p>\"At least the rain has held off,\" Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>\"Give it another month,\" I replied sourly. \"We'll be wading up to our hips down there by mid-October.\"</p><p>\"We will have located and dealt with the vampaneze by then,\" Mr. Crepsley said, without conviction.</p><p>\"That's what you said two months ago,\" I reminded him.</p><p>\"And last month,\" Harkat added.</p><p>\"You wish to call off the search and leave these people to the vampaneze?\" Mr. Crepsley asked quietly.</p><p>Harkat and me looked at each other, then shook our heads. \"Of course not,\" I sighed. \"We're just tired and cranky. Let's get back to the hotel, dry ourselves off and get something warm to eat. We'll be fine after a good day's sleep.\"</p><p>Finding a nearby fire escape, we climbed to the roof of the building and set off across the skylight of the city, where there were no police or soldiers.</p><p>Six months had passed since the Lord of the Vampaneze escaped. Vancha had gone to Vampire Mountain to tell the Princes and Generals the news, and had not yet returned. For the first three months Mr. Crepsley, Harkat and me had roamed without purpose, letting our feet take us where they wished. Then word reached us of the terror in Mr. Crepsley's home city - people were being killed, their bodies drained of blood. Reports claimed vampires were to blame, but we knew better. Rumours had previously reached us of a vampaneze presence in the city, and this was all the confirmation we needed.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley cared for these people. Those he'd known when he lived here as a human were long since dead and buried, but he looked upon their grandchildren and great-grandchildren as his spiritual kin. Thirteen years earlier, when a mad vampaneze by the name of Murlough was savaging the city, Mr. Crepsley returned - with me and Evra Von, a snake-boy from the Cirque Du Freak - to stop him. Now that history was repeating itself, he felt compelled to intervene again.</p><p>\"But maybe I should ignore my feelings,\" he'd mused three months earlier, as we discussed the situation. \"We must focus on the hunt for the Vampaneze Lord. It would be wrong of me to drag us away from our quest.\"</p><p>\"Not so,\" I'd disagreed. \"Mr. Tiny told us we'd have to follow our hearts if we were to find the Vampaneze Lord. Your hearts drawing you home, and my heart says I should stick by you. I think we should go.\"</p><p>Harkat Mulds, a grey-skinned Little Person who'd learned to talk, agreed, so we set off for the city where Mr. Crepsley had been born, to evaluate the situation and help if we could. When we arrived, we soon found ourselves in the middle of a perplexing mystery. Vampaneze were definitely living here - at least three or four, if our estimate was correct - but were they part of the war force or rogue madmen? If they were warriors, they should be more careful about how they killed - sane vampaneze don't leave the bodies of their victims where humans can find them. But if they were mad, they shouldn't be capable of hiding so skilfully - after three months of searching, we hadn't found a trace of a single vampaneze in the tunnels beneath the city.</p><p>Back at the hotel, we entered via the window. We'd rented two rooms on the upper floor, and used the windows to get in and out at night, since we were too dirty and damp to use the lobby. Besides, the less we moved about on the ground, the better - the city was in uproar, with police and soldiers patrolling the streets, arresting anyone who looked out of place.</p><p>While Mr. Crepsley and Harkat used the bathrooms, I undressed and waited for a free bath. We could have rented three rooms, so we'd each have a bath, but it was safer for Harkat not to show himself - Mr. Crepsley and me could pass for human, but the monstrous-looking, stitched-together Harkat couldn't.</p><p>I nearly fell asleep sitting on the end of the bed. The last three months had been long and arduous. Every night we roamed the roofs and tunnels of the city, searching for vampaneze, avoiding the police, soldiers and frightened humans, many of whom had taken to carrying guns and other weapons. It was taking its toll on all of us, but eleven people had died - that we knew of - and more would follow if we didn't stick to our task.</p><p>Standing, I walked around the room, trying to stay awake long enough to get into the bath. Sometimes I didn't, and would wake the following night stinking, sweaty and filthy, feeling like something a cat had coughed up.</p><p>I thought about my previous visit to this city. I'd been much younger, still learning what it meant to be a half-vampire. I'd met my first and only girlfriend here - Debbie Hemlock. She'd been dark-skinned, full-lipped and bright-eyed. I would have loved to get to know her better. But duty called, the mad vampaneze was killed, and the currents of life swept us apart.</p><p>I'd walked by the house where she'd lived with her parents several times since returning, half-hoping she still lived there. But new tenants had moved in and there was no sign of the Hemlocks. Just as well, really - as a half-vampire I aged at a fifth the human rate, so although nearly thirteen years had passed since I last kissed Debbie, I only looked a few years older. Debbie would be a grown woman now. It would have been confusing if we'd run into one another.</p><p>The door connecting the bedrooms opened and Harkat entered, drying himself with a huge hotel towel. \"The bath's free,\" he said, wiping around the top of his bald, grey, scarred head with the towel, careful not to irritate his round green eyes, which had no eyelids to protect them.</p>","<p>\"Cheers, ears,\" I grinned, slipping by him. That was an in-joke - Harkat, like all the Little People, had ears, but they were stitched under the skin at the sides of his head, so it looked as if he hadn't any.</p><p>Harkat had drained the bath, put the plug back in and turned on the hot tap, so it was almost full with fresh water when I arrived. I tested the temperature, added a dash of cold, turned off the taps and slid in - heavenly! I raised a hand to brush a lock of hair out of my eyes but my arm wouldn't lift all the way - I was too tired. Relaxing, I decided to just lie there a few minutes. I could wash my hair later. To simply lie in the bath and relax... for a few minutes... would be...</p><p>Without finishing the thought, I fell soundly asleep, and when I awoke it was night again, and I was blue all over from having spent the day in a bath of cold, grimy water.</p><p>Chapter TWO</p><p>WE RETURNED to the hotel at the end of another long, disappointing night. We'd stayed at the same hotel since coming to the city. We hadn't meant to - the plan had been to switch every couple of weeks - but the search for the vampaneze had left us so exhausted, we hadn't been able to muster the energy to go looking for fresh accommodation. Even the sturdy Harkat Mulds, who didn't need to sleep very much, was dozing off for four or five hours each day.</p><p>I felt better after a hot bath and flicked on the TV to see if there was any news about the killings. I learnt it was early Thursday morning - days melted into one another when you lived among vampires, and I rarely took any notice of them - and no new deaths had been reported. It had been almost two weeks since the last body was discovered. There was the slightest hint of hope in the air - many people thought the reign of terror had come to an end. I doubted we'd be that lucky, but I kept my fingers crossed as I turned the set off and headed for the welcome hotel bed.</p><p>Sometime later I was roughly shaken awake. A strong light was shining through the thin material of the curtains and I knew instantly that it was midday or early afternoon, which was way too soon to be even thinking about getting out of bed. Grunting, I sat up and found an anxious-looking Harkat leaning over me.</p><p>\"Wassup?\" I muttered, rubbing the grains of sleep from my eyes.</p><p>\"Someone's knocking at... your door,\" Harkat croaked.</p><p>\"Tell them to please go away,\" I said - or words to that effect!</p><p>\"I was going to, but...\" He paused.</p><p>\"Who is it?\" I asked, sensing trouble.</p><p>\"I don't know. I opened the door of my room a crack... and checked. It's nobody connected with the hotel, although... there's a staff member with him. He's a small man, carrying a big... briefcase, and he's...\" Again Harkat paused. \"Come see for yourself.\"</p><p>I got up as there was a round of fresh knuckle raps. I hurried through to Harkat's room. Mr. Crepsley was sleeping soundly in one of the twin beds. We tiptoed past him and opened the door ever so slightly. One of the figures in the corridor was familiar - the day manager of the hotel - but I'd never seen the other. He was small, as Harkat had said, and thin, with a huge black briefcase. He was wearing a dark grey suit, black shoes and an old-fashioned bowler hat. He was scowling and raising his knuckles to knock again as we closed the door.</p><p>\"Think we should answer?\" I asked Harkat.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he said. \"He doesn't look like the sort who'll... go away if we ignore him.\"</p><p>\"Who do you think he is?\"</p><p>\"I'm not sure, but there's something... officious about him. He might be a police officer or in... the army.\"</p><p>\"You don't think they know about...?\" I nodded at the sleeping vampire.</p><p>\"They'd send more than one man... if they did,\" Harkat replied.</p><p>I thought about it for a moment, then made up my mind. \"I'll go see what he wants. But I won't let him in unless I have to - I don't want people snooping around in here while Mr. Crepsley's resting.\"</p><p>\"Shall I stay here?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"Yes, but keep close to the door and don't lock it - I'll call if I run into trouble.\"</p><p>Leaving Harkat to fetch his axe, I quickly pulled on a pair of trousers and a shirt and went to see what the man in the corridor wanted. Pausing by the door, not opening it, I cleared my throat and called out innocently, \"Who is it?\"</p><p>In immediate response, in a voice like a small dog's bark, the man with the briefcase said, \"Mr. Horston?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I replied, breathing a small sigh of relief. \"You have the wrong room.\"</p><p>\"Oh?\" The man in the corridor sounded surprised. \"This isn't Mr. Vur Horston's room?\"</p><p>\"No, it's-\" I winced. I'd forgotten the false names we'd given when registering! Mr. Crepsley had signed in as Vur Horston and I'd said I was his son. (Harkat had crept in when no one was watching.) \"I mean,\" I began again, \"this is my room, not my dad's. I'm Darren Horston, his son.\"</p><p>\"Ah.\" I could sense his smile through the door. \"Excellent. You're the reason I'm here. Is your father with you?</p><p>\"He's...\" I hesitated. \"Why do you want to know? Who are you?\"</p><p>\"If you open the door and let me in, I'll explain.\"</p><p>\"I'd like to know who you are first,\" I said. \"These are dangerous times. I've been told not to open the door to strangers.\"</p><p>\"Ah. Excellent,\" the little man said again. \"I should of course not expect you to open the door to an unannounced visitor. Forgive me. My name is Mr. Blaws.\"</p><p>\"Blores?\"</p><p>\"Blaws,\" he said, and patiently spelt it out.</p><p>\"What do you want, Mr. Blaws?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I'm a school inspector,\" he replied. \"I've come to find out why you aren't in school.\"</p><p>My jaw dropped about a thousand kilometres.</p><p>\"May I come in, Darren?\" Mr. Blaws asked. When I didn't answer, he rapped on the door again and sung out, \"Darrrrennn?\"</p><p>\"Um. Just a minute, please,\" I muttered, then turned my back to the door and leant weakly against it, wildly wondering what I should do.</p><p>If I turned the inspector away, he'd return with help, so in the end I opened the door and let him in. The hotel manager departed once he saw that everything was OK, leaving me alone with the serious-looking Mr. Blaws. The little man set his briefcase down on the floor, then removed his bowler hat and held it in his left hand, behind his back, as he shook my hand with his right. He was studying me carefully. There was a light layer of bristle on my chin, my hair was long and scruffy, and my face still carried small scars and burn marks from my Trials of Initiation seven years before.</p>","<p>\"You look quite old,\" Mr. Blaws commented, sitting down without being asked. \"Very mature for fifteen. Maybe it's the hair. You could do with a trim and a shave.\"</p><p>\"I guess...\" I didn't know why he thought I was fifteen, and I was too bewildered to correct him.</p><p>\"So!\" he boomed, laying his bowler hat aside and his huge briefcase across his lap. \"Your father - Mr. Horston - is he in?\"</p><p>\"Um... yeah. He's... sleeping.\" I was finding it hard to string words together.</p><p>\"Oh, of course. I forgot he was on night shifts. Perhaps I should call back at a more convenient...\" He trailed off, thumbed open his briefcase, dug out a sheet of paper and studied it as though it was an historical document. \"Ah,\" he said. \"Not possible to rearrange - I'm on a tight schedule. You'll have to wake him.\"</p><p>\"Um. Right. I'll go... see if he's...\" I hurried through to where the vampire lay sleeping and anxiously shook him awake. Harkat stood back, saying nothing - he'd heard everything and was just as confused as I was.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley opened one eye, saw that it was daytime, and shut it again. \"Is the hotel on fire?\" he groaned.</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"Then go away and-\"</p><p>\"There's a man in my room. A school inspector. He knows our names - at least, the names we checked in under - and he thinks I'm fifteen. He wants to know why I'm not at school.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley shot out of bed as though he'd been bitten. \"How can this be?\" he snapped. He rushed to the door, stopped, then retreated slowly. \"How did he identify himself?\"</p><p>\"Just told me his name - Mr. Blaws.\"</p><p>\"It could be a cover story.\"</p><p>\"I don't think so. The manager of the hotel was with him. He wouldn't have let him up if he wasn't on the level. Besides, he looks like a school inspector.\"</p><p>\"Looks can be deceptive,\" Mr. Crepsley noted.</p><p>\"Not this time,\" I said. \"You'd better get dressed and come meet him.\"</p><p>The vampire hesitated, then nodded sharply. I left him to prepare, and went to close the curtains in my room. Mr. Blaws looked at me oddly. \"My father's eyes are very sensitive,\" I said. \"That's why he prefers to work at night.\"</p><p>\"Ah,\" Mr. Blaws said. \"Excellent.\"</p><p>We said nothing more for the next few minutes, while we waited for my 'father' to make his entrance. I felt very uncomfortable, sitting in silence with this stranger, but he acted as though he felt perfectly at home. When Mr. Crepsley finally entered, Mr. Blaws stood and shook his hand, not letting go of the briefcase. \"Mr. Horston,\" the inspector beamed. \"A pleasure, sir.\"</p><p>\"Likewise.\" Mr. Crepsley smiled briefly, then sat as far away from the curtains as he could and drew his red robes tightly around himself.</p><p>\"So!\" Mr. Blaws boomed after a short silence. \"What's wrong with our young trooper?\"</p><p>\"Wrong?\" Mr. Crepsley blinked. \"Nothing is wrong.\"</p><p>\"Then why isn't he at school with all the other boys and girls?\"</p><p>\"Darren does not go to school,\" Mr. Crepsley said, as though speaking to an idiot. \"Why should he?\"</p><p>Mr. Blaws was taken aback. \"Why, to learn, Mr. Horston, the same as any other fifteen year old.\"</p><p>\"Darren is not...\" Mr. Crepsley stopped. \"How do you know his age?\" he asked cagily.</p><p>\"From his birth certificate, of course,\" Mr. Blaws laughed.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley glanced at me for an answer, but I was as lost as he was, and could only shrug helplessly. \"And how did you acquire that?\" the vampire asked.</p><p>Mr. Blaws looked at us strangely. \"You included it with the rest of the relevant forms when you enrolled him at Mahler's,\" he said.</p><p>\"Mahler's?\" Mr. Crepsley repeated.</p><p>\"The school you chose to send Darren to.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley sank back in his chair and brooded on that. Then he asked to see the birth certificate, along with the other 'relevant forms'. Mr. Blaws reached into his briefcase again and fished out a folder. \"There you go,\" he said. \"Birth certificate, records from his previous school, medical certificates, the enrolment form you filled in. Everything present and correct.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley opened the file, flicked through a few sheets, studied the signatures at the bottom of one form, then passed the file across to me. \"Look through those papers,\" he said. \"Check that the information is... correct.\"</p><p>It wasn't correct, of course - I wasn't fifteen and hadn't been to school recently; nor had I visited a doctor since joining the ranks of the undead - but it was fully detailed. The files built up a complete picture of a fifteen-year-old boy called Darren Horston, who'd moved to this city during the summer with his father, a man who worked night shifts in a local abattoir and...</p><p>My breath caught in my throat - the abattoir was the one where we'd first encountered the mad vampaneze, Murlough, thirteen years ago! \"Look at this!\" I gasped, holding the form out to Mr. Crepsley, but he waved it away.</p><p>\"Is it accurate?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Of course it's accurate,\" Mr. Blaws answered. \"You filled in the forms yourself.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Didn't you?\"</p><p>\"Of course he did,\" I said quickly, before Mr. Crepsley could reply. \"Sorry to act so befuddled. It's been a hard week. Um. Family problems.\"</p><p>\"Ah. That's why you haven't shown up at Mahler's?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" I forced a shaky smile. \"We should have rung and informed you. Sorry. Didn't think.\"</p><p>\"No problem,\" Mr. Blaws said, taking the papers back. \"I'm glad that's all it was. We were afraid something bad had happened to you.\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said, shooting Mr. Crepsley a look that said, 'play ball'. \"Nothing bad happened.\"</p><p>\"Excellent. Then you'll be in on Monday?\"</p><p>\"Monday?\"</p><p>\"Hardly seems worth while coming in tomorrow, what with it being the end of the week. Come early Monday morning and we'll sort you out with a timetable and show you around. Ask for-\"</p><p>\"Excuse me,\" Mr. Crepsley interrupted, \"but Darren will not be going to your school on Monday or any other day.\"</p><p>\"Oh?\" Mr. Blaws frowned and gently closed the lid of his briefcase. \"Has he enrolled at another school?\"</p>","<p>\"No. Darren does not need to go to school. I educate him.\"</p><p>\"Really? There was no mention in the forms of your being a qualified teacher.\"</p><p>\"I am not a-\"</p><p>\"And of course,\" Blaws went on, \"we both know that only a qualified teacher can educate a child at home.\" He smiled like a shark. \"Don't we?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley didn't know what to say. He had no experience of the modern educational system. When he was a boy, parents could do what they liked with their children. I decided to take matters into my own hands.</p><p>\"Mr. Blaws?\"</p><p>\"Yes, Darren?\"</p><p>\"What would happen if I didn't turn up at Mahler's?\"</p><p>He sniffed snootily. \"If you enrol at a different school and pass on the paperwork to me, everything will be fine.\"</p><p>\"And if - for the sake of argument - I didn't enrol at another school?\"</p><p>Mr. Blaws laughed. \"Everyone has to go to school. Once you turn sixteen, your time is your own, but for the next...\" He opened the briefcase again and checked his files \"...seven months, you must go to school.\"</p><p>\"So if I chose not to go...?\"</p><p>\"We'd send a social worker to see what the problem was.\"</p><p>\"And if we asked you to tear up my enrolment form and forget about me - if we said we'd sent it to you by mistake - what then?\"</p><p>Mr. Blaws drummed his fingers on the top of his bowler hat. He wasn't used to such bizarre questions and didn't know what to make of us. \"We can't go around tearing up official forms, Darren,\" he chuckled uneasily.</p><p>\"But if we'd sent them by accident and wanted to withdraw them?\"</p><p>He shook his head firmly. \"We weren't aware of your existence before you contacted us, but now that we are, we're responsible for you. We'd have to chase you up if we thought you weren't getting a proper education.\"</p><p>\"Meaning you'd send social workers after us?\"</p><p>\"Social workers first,\" he agreed, then looked at us with a glint in his eye. \"Of course, if you gave them a hard time, we'd have to call in the police next, and who knows where it would end.\"</p><p>I took that information on board, nodded grimly, then faced Mr. Crepsley. \"You know what this means, don't you?\" He stared back uncertainly. \"You'll have to start making packed lunches for me!\"</p><p>Chapter THREE</p><p>\"MEDDLING, SMUG, stupid little...\" Mr. Crepsley snarled. He was pacing the hotel room, cursing the name of Mr. Blaws. The school inspector had left and Harkat had rejoined us. He'd heard everything through the thin connecting door, but could make no more sense of it than us. \"I will track him down tonight and bleed him dry,\" Mr. Crepsley vowed. \"That will teach him not to come poking his nose in!\"</p><p>\"Talk like that won't fix this,\" I sighed. \"We have to use our heads.\"</p><p>\"Who says it is talk?\" Mr. Crepsley retorted. \"He gave us his telephone number in case we need to contact him. I will find his address and-\"</p><p>\"It's a mobile phone,\" I sighed. \"You can't trace addresses through them. Besides, what good would killing him do? Somebody else would replace him. Our records are on file. He's only the messenger.\"</p><p>\"We could move,\" Harkat suggested. \"Find a new hotel.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"He has seen our faces and would broadcast our descriptions. It would make matters more complicated than they already are.\"</p><p>\"What I want to know is how our records were submitted,\" I said. \"The signatures on the files weren't ours, but they were pretty damn close.\"</p><p>\"I know,\" he grunted. \"Not a great forgery, but adequate.\"</p><p>\"Is it possible there's been... a mix-up?\" Harkat asked. \"Perhaps a real Vur Horston and his son... sent in the forms, and you've been confused with them.\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said. \"The address of this hotel was included and so were our room numbers. And...\" I told them about the abattoir.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley stopped pacing. \"Murlough!\" he hissed. \"That was a period of history I thought I would never have to revisit.\"</p><p>\"I don't understand,\" Harkat said. \"How could this be connected to Murlough? Are you saying he's alive and has... set you up?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Murlough is definitely dead. But someone must know we killed him. And that someone is almost certainly responsible for the humans who have been killed recently.\" He sat down and rubbed the long scar that marked the left side of his face. \"This is a trap.\"</p><p>There was a long, tense silence.</p><p>\"It can't be,\" I said in the end. \"How could the vampaneze have found out about Murlough?\"</p><p>\"Desmond Tiny,\" Mr. Crepsley said bleakly. \"He knew about our run in with Murlough, and must have told the vampaneze. But I cannot understand why they faked the birth certificate and school records. If they knew so much about us, and where we are, they should have killed us cleanly and honourably, as is the vampaneze way.\"</p><p>\"That's true,\" I noted. \"You don't punish a murderer by sending him to school. Although,\" I added, remembering my long-ago schooldays, \"death can sometimes seem preferable to double science on a Thursday afternoon...\"</p><p>Again a lengthy silence descended. Harkat broke it by clearing his throat. \"This sounds crazy,\" the Little Person said, \"but what if Mr. Crepsley did ... submit the forms?\"</p><p>\"Come again?\" I said.</p><p>\"He might have done it in... his sleep.\"</p><p>\"You think he sleep wrote a birth cert and school records, then submitted them to a local school?\" I didn't even bother to laugh.</p><p>\"Things like this have happened before,\" Harkat mumbled. \"Remember Pasta O'Malley at the... Cirque Du Freak? He read books at night when he was asleep. He could never recall reading them, but if you asked... him about them, he could answer all your questions.\"</p><p>\"I'd forgotten about Pasta,\" I muttered, giving Harkat's proposal some thought.</p><p>\"I could not have filled in those forms,\" Mr. Crepsley said stiffly.</p><p>\"It's unlikely,\" Harkat agreed, \"but we do strange things... when we sleep. Perhaps you-\"</p><p>\"No,\" Mr. Crepsley interrupted. \"You do not understand. I could not have done it because...\" He looked away sheepishly. \"I cannot read or write.\"</p>","<p>The vampire might have had two heads, the way Harkat and me gawped at him.</p><p>\"Of course you can read and write!\" I bellowed. \"You signed your name when we checked in.\"</p><p>\"Signing one's name is an easy feat,\" he replied quietly, with wounded dignity. \"I can read numbers and recognize certain words - I am able to read maps quite accurately - but as for genuine reading and writing...\" He shook his head.</p><p>\"How can you not be able to read or write?\" I asked ignorantly.</p><p>\"Things were different when I was young. The world was simpler. It was not necessary to be a master of the written word. I was the fifth child of a poor family and went to work at the age of eight.\"</p><p>\"But... but...\" I pointed a finger at him. \"You told me you love Shakespeare's plays and poems!\"</p><p>\"I do,\" he said. \"Evanna read all his works to me over the decades. Wordsworth, Keats, Joyce - many others. I often meant to learn to read for myself, but I never got around to it.\"</p><p>\"This is... I don't... Why didn't you tell me?\" I snapped. \"We've been together fifteen years, and this is the first time you've mentioned it!\"</p><p>He shrugged. \"I assumed you knew. Many vampires are illiterate. That is why so little of our history or laws is written down - most of us are incapable of reading.\"</p><p>Shaking my head, exasperated, I put aside the vampire's revelation and concentrated on the more immediate problem. \"You didn't fill out the forms - that's settled. So who did and what are we going to do about it?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley had no answer to that, but Harkat had a suggestion. \"It could have been Mr. Tiny,\" he said. \"He loves to stir things up. Perhaps this is his idea... of a joke.\"</p><p>We mulled that one over.</p><p>\"It has a whiff of him about it,\" I agreed. \"I can't see why he'd want to send me back to school, but it's the sort of trick I can imagine him pulling.\"</p><p>\"Mr. Tiny would appear to be the most logical culprit,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Vampaneze are not known for their sense of humour. Nor do they go in for intricate plots - like vampires, they are simple and direct.\"</p><p>\"Let's say he is behind it,\" I mused. \"That still leaves us with the problem of what to do. Should I report for class Monday morning? Or do we ignore Mr. Blaws' warning and carry on as before?\"</p><p>\"I would rather not send you,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"There is strength in unity. At present, we are well prepared to defend ourselves should we come under attack. With you at school, we would not be there to help you if you ran into trouble, and you would not be able to help us if our foes struck here.\"</p><p>\"But if I don't go,\" I noted, \"we'll have school inspectors - and worse - dogging our heels.\"</p><p>\"The other option is to leave,\" Harkat said. \"Just pack our bags and go.\"</p><p>\"That is worth considering,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed. \"I do not like the idea of leaving these people to suffer, but if this is a trap designed to divide us, perhaps the killings will stop if we leave.\"</p><p>\"Or they might increase,\" I said, \"to tempt us back.\"</p><p>We thought about it some more, weighing up the various options.</p><p>\"I want to stay,\" Harkat said eventually. \"Life is getting more dangerous, but perhaps... that means we're meant to be here. Maybe this city is where we're destined... to lock horns with the Vampaneze Lord again.\"</p><p>\"I agree with Harkat,\" Mr. Crepsley said, \"but this is a matter for Darren to decide. As a Prince, he must make the decision.\"</p><p>\"Thanks a lot,\" I said sarcastically.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley smiled. \"It is your decision, not only because you are a Prince, but because this concerns you the most - you will have to mix with human children and teachers, and you will be the most vulnerable to attack. Whether this is a vampaneze trap or a whim of Mr. Tiny's, life will be hard for you if we stay.\"</p><p>He was right. Going back to school would be a nightmare. I'd no idea what fifteen year olds studied. Classes would be hard. Homework would drive me loopy. And having to answer to teachers, after six years of lording it over the vampires as a Prince... It could get very uncomfortable.</p><p>Yet part of me was drawn to the notion. To sit in a classroom again, to learn, make friends, show off my advanced physical skills in PE, maybe go out with a few girls...</p><p>\"The hell with it,\" I grinned. \"If it's a trap, let's call their bluff. If it's a joke, we'll show we know how to take it.\"</p><p>\"That is the spirit,\" Mr. Crepsley boomed.</p><p>\"Besides,\" I chuckled weakly, \"I've endured the Trials of Initiation twice, a terrifying journey through an underground stream, encounters with killers, a bear and wild boars. How bad can school be?\"</p><p>Chapter FOUR</p><p>I ARRIVED at Mahler's an hour before classes began. I'd had a busy weekend. First there'd been my uniform to buy - a green jumper, light green shirt, green tie, grey trousers, black shoes - then books, notepaper and A4 writing pads, a ruler, pens and pencils, an eraser, set squares and a compass, as well as a scientific calculator, whose array of strange buttons - 'INV', 'SIN', 'COS', 'EE' - meant nothing to me. I'd also had to buy a homework report book, which I'd have to write all my homework assignments in - Mr. Crepsley would have to sign the book each night, saying I'd done the work I was meant to. I shopped by myself - Mr. Crepsley couldn't move about during the day, and Harkat's strange appearance meant it was better for him to stay inside. I got back to the hotel with my bags late Saturday evening, after two days of non-stop shopping. Then I remembered that I'd need a schoolbag as well, so I rushed out on one last-gasp, lightning-fast expedition to the nearest supplier. I bought a simple black bag with plenty of space for my books, and picked up a plastic lunch box as well.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley and Harkat got a great kick out of my uniform. The first time they saw me stuffed inside it, walking stiffly, they laughed for ten minutes. \"Stop it!\" I growled, tearing a shoe off and lobbing it at them.</p><p>I spent Sunday wearing in the uniform, walking about the hotel rooms fully dressed. I did a lot of scratching and twitching - it had been a long time since I'd had to wear anything so confining. That night I shaved carefully and let Mr. Crepsley cut my hair. Afterwards he and Harkat left to hunt for the vampaneze. For the first night since coming to the city, I stayed behind - I had school in the morning, and needed to be fresh for it. As time progressed, I'd work out a schedule whereby I'd assist in the hunt for the killers, but the first few nights were bound to be difficult and we all agreed it would be for the best if I dropped out of the hunt for a while.</p>","<p>I got hardly any sleep. I was almost as nervous as I'd been seven years earlier, when awaiting the verdict of the Vampire Princes after I'd failed my Trials of Initiation. At least then I knew what the worst could be - death - but I'd no idea what to expect from this strange adventure.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley and Harkat were awake in the morning to see me off. They ate breakfast with me and tried to act as though I'd nothing to worry about. \"This is a wonderful opportunity,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"You have often complained of the life you lost when you became a half-vampire. This is a chance to revisit your past. You can be human again, for a while. It will be fascinating.\"</p><p>\"Why don't you go instead of me then?\" I snapped.</p><p>\"I would if I could,\" he deadpanned.</p><p>\"It'll be fun,\" Harkat assured me. \"Strange at first, but give it time and you'll fit in. And don't feel inferior: these kids will know... a lot more about the school curriculum than you, but you are... a man of the world and know things that they will... never learn, no matter how old they live to be.\"</p><p>\"You are a Prince,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed, \"far superior to any there.\"</p><p>Their efforts didn't really help, but I was glad they were supporting me instead of mocking me.</p><p>With breakfast out of the way, I made a few ham sandwiches, packed them in my bag along with a small jar of pickled onions and a bottle of orange juice, and then it was time to leave.</p><p>\"Do you want me to walk you to school?\" Mr. Crepsley asked innocently. \"There are many dangerous roads to cross. Or perhaps you could ask a lollypop lady to hold your hand and-\"</p><p>\"Stuff it,\" I grunted, and bolted out the door with my bag full of books.</p><p>Mahler's was a large, modern school, the buildings arranged in a square around an open-air, cement recreational area. The main doors were open when I arrived, so I entered and went looking for the headmaster's room. The halls and rooms were clearly signposted, and I found Mr. Olivers' room within a couple of minutes, but there was no sign of the headmaster. Half an hour passed - no Mr. Chivers. I wondered if Mr. Blaws had forgotten to tell the headmaster of my early arrival, but then I recalled the little man with the huge briefcase, and knew he wasn't the sort who forgot things like that. Maybe Mr. Chivers thought he was supposed to meet me by the main doors or the staffroom. I decided to check.</p><p>The staffroom could have held twenty-five or thirty teachers, but I saw only three when I knocked and entered in response to a cry of, \"Come in.\" Two were middle-aged men, glued to thick chairs, reading enormous newspapers. The other was a burly woman, busy pinning sheets of printed paper to the walls.</p><p>\"Help you?\" the woman snapped without looking around.</p><p>\"My name's Darren Horston. I'm looking for Mr. Chivers.\"</p><p>\"Mr. Chivers isn't in yet. Have you an appointment?\"</p><p>\"Um. Yes. I think so.\"</p><p>\"Then wait for him outside his office. This is the staffroom.\"</p><p>\"Oh. OK.\"</p><p>Closing the door, I picked up my bag and returned to the headmaster's room. There was still no sign of him. I waited ten more minutes, then went searching for him again. This time I made for the school entrance, where I found a group of teenagers leaning against a wall, talking loudly, yawning, laughing, calling each other names and cursing pleasantly.</p><p>They were dressed in Mahler uniforms like me, but the clothes looked natural on them.</p><p>I approached a gang of five boys and two girls. They had their backs to me and were discussing some programme they'd seen on TV the night before. I cleared my throat to attract their attention, then smiled and stuck out a hand to the nearest boy when he turned. \"Darren Horston,\" I grinned. \"I'm new here. I'm looking for Mr. Chivers. You haven't seen him, have you?\"</p><p>The boy stared at my hand - he didn't shake it - then into my face.</p><p>\"You wot?\" he mumbled.</p><p>\"My name's Darren Horston,\" I said again. \"I'm looking for-\"</p><p>\"I 'eard you the first time,\" he interrupted, scratching his nose and studying me suspiciously.</p><p>\"Shivers ain't in yet,\" a girl said, and giggled as though she'd said something funny.</p><p>\"Shivers ain't ever in before ten past nine,\" one of the boys yawned.</p><p>\"An even later on a Monday,\" the girl said.</p><p>\"Everyone knows that,\" the boy who'd first spoken added.</p><p>\"Oh,\" I muttered. \"Well, as I said, I'm new here, so I can't be expected to know things that everyone else knows, can I?\" I smiled, pleased to have made such a clever point on my first day in school.</p><p>\"Get stuffed, asswipe,\" the boy said in response, which wasn't exactly what I'd been expecting.</p><p>\"Pardon?\" I blinked.</p><p>\"You 'eard.\" He squared up to me. He was about a head taller, dark-haired, with a nasty squint. I could knock the stuffing out of any human in the school, but I'd momentarily forgotten that, and backed away from him, unsure of why he was acting this way.</p><p>\"Go on, Smickey,\" one of the other boys laughed. \"Do 'im!\"</p><p>\"Nah,\" the boy called Smickey smirked. \"He ain't worth it.\"</p><p>Turning his back on me, he resumed his conversation with the others as though nothing had interrupted it. Shaken and confused, I slouched away. As I turned the corner, out of human but not vampire hearing, I heard one of the girls say, \"That guy's seriously weird!\"</p><p>\"See that bag he was carrying?\" Smickey laughed. \"It was the size of a cow! He must have half the books in the country in it!\"</p><p>\"He spoke weird,\" the girl said.</p><p>\"And he looked even weirder,\" the other girl added. \"Those scars and red patches of flesh. And did you see that awful haircut? He looked like somefing out of a zoo!\"</p><p>\"Too right,\" Smickey said. \"He smelt like it too!\"</p><p>The gang laughed, then talk turned to the TV programme again. Trudging up the stairs, clutching my bag to my chest, feeling very small and ashamed of my hair and appearance, I positioned myself by Mr. Chivers' door, hung my head, and miserably waited for the headmaster to show.</p><p>It had been a discouraging start, and though I liked to think things could only get better, I had a nasty feeling in the pit of my belly that they were going to get a whole lot worse!</p><p>Chapter FIVE</p><p>MR. CHIVERS arrived shortly after a quarter past nine, puffing and red-faced. (I later learnt that he cycled to school.) He hurried past me without saying anything, opened the door to his room, and stumbled to the window, where he stood staring down at the cement quad. Spotting someone, he slid open the window and roared, \"Kevin O'Brien! Have you been kicked out of class already?\"</p>","<p>\"Wasn't my fault, sir,\" a young boy shouted back. \"The top came off my pen in my bag, ruining my homework. Could have happened to anyone, sir. I don't think I should be kicked out for-\"</p><p>\"Report to my office during your next free period, O'Brien!\" Mr. Chivers interrupted. \"I have a few floors for you to scrub.\"</p><p>\"Aw, sir!\"</p><p>Mr. Chivers slammed the window shut. \"You!\" he said, beckoning me in. \"What are you here for?\"</p><p>\"I'm-\"</p><p>\"You didn't break a window, did you?\" he cut in. \"Because if you did, there'll be hell and leather to pay!\"</p><p>\"I didn't break a window,\" I snapped. \"I haven't had time to break anything. I've been stuck outside your door since eight, waiting. You re late!\"</p><p>\"Oh?\" He sat down, surprised by my directness. \"Sorry. A flat tyre. It's the little monster who lives two floors below. He...\" Clearing his throat, he remembered who he was and adopted a scowl. \"Never mind about me - who are you and why were you waiting?\"</p><p>\"My name's Darren Horston. I'm-\"</p><p>\"- the new boy!\" he exclaimed. \"Sorry - clean forgot you were coming.\" Getting up, he took my hand and pumped it. \"I was away this weekend - orienteering - only got back last night. I jotted down a note and pinned it to the fridge on Friday, but I must have missed it this morning.\"</p><p>\"No problem,\" I said, freeing my fingers from his sweaty hand. \"You're here now. Better late than never.\"</p><p>He studied me curiously. \"Is that how you addressed your previous headmaster?\" he asked.</p><p>I remembered how I used to tremble when faced with the headmistress of my old school. \"No,\" I chuckled.</p><p>\"Good, because it's not how you'll address me either. I'm no tyrant, but I don't stand for backchat. Speak respectfully when you talk to me, and add a 'sir' at the end. Got that?\"</p><p>I took a deep breath. \"Yes.\" A pause. \"Sir.\"</p><p>\"Better,\" he grunted, then invited me to sit. Opening a drawer, he found a file and perused it in silence. \"Good grades,\" he said after a couple of minutes, laying it aside. \"If you can match those here, we won't complain.\"</p><p>\"I'll do my best. Sir.\"</p><p>\"That's all we ask.\" Mr. Chivers was studying my face, fascinated by my scars and burn-marks. \"You've had a rough ride, haven't you?\" he remarked. \"Must be horrible to be trapped in a burning building.\"</p><p>\"Yes, sir.\" That was in the report Mr. Blaws had shown me - according to the forms my 'father' submitted, I'd been badly burnt in a house fire when I was twelve.</p><p>\"Still, all's well that ends well! You're alive and active, and anything else is a bonus.\" Standing, he put the file away, checked the front of his suit - there were traces of egg and toast crumbs on his tie and shirt, which he picked at - then made for the door, telling me to follow.</p><p>Mr. Chivers led me on a quick tour of the school, pointing out the computer rooms, assembly hall, gymnasium and the main classrooms. The school used to be a music academy, hence its name (Mahler was a famous composer), but had closed down twenty years earlier, before reopening as a regular school.</p><p>\"We still place a lot of emphasis on musical excellence,\" Mr. Chivers told me as we checked out a large room with half a dozen pianos. \"Do you play any instruments?\"</p><p>\"The flute,\" I said.</p><p>\"A flautist! Superb! We haven't had a decent flautist since Siobhan Toner graduated three - or was it four? - years ago. We'll have to try you out, see what you're made of, eh?\"</p><p>\"Yes, sir,\" I replied weakly. I figured we were talking at cross purposes - he was referring to real flutes, whereas all I knew how to play was a tin-whistle - but I didn't know whether it was the time for me to point this out. In the end I kept my mouth shut and hoped he'd forget about my supposed flute-playing talents.</p><p>He told me each lesson lasted forty minutes. There was a ten-minute break at eleven o'clock; fifty minutes for lunch at ten past one; school finished at four. \"Detention runs from four-thirty to six,\" he informed me, \"but hopefully that won't concern you, eh?\"</p><p>\"I hope not, sir,\" I replied meekly.</p><p>The tour concluded back at his office, where he furnished me with my timetable. It was a frightening list - English, history, geography, science, maths, mechanical drawing, two modern languages, computer studies. A double dose of PE on Wednesdays. I had three free periods, one on Monday, one on Tuesday, one on Thursday. Mr. Chivers said these were for extra-curricular activities, such as music or extra languages, or they could be used as study classes.</p><p>He shook my hand again, wished me the best of luck and told me to call on him if I ran into difficulty. After warning me not to break any windows or give my teachers grief he showed me out into the corridor, where he left me. It was 9.40 A bell rang. Time for my first class of the day - geography.</p><p>The lesson went reasonably well. I'd spent the last six years poring over maps and keeping abreast of the War of the Scars, so I had a better idea of the shape of the world than most of my classmates. But I knew nothing about human geography - a lot of the lesson revolved around economies and culture, and how humans shaped their environments - and I was at a loss every time talk switched from mountain ranges and rivers to political systems and population statistics.</p><p>Even allowing for my limited knowledge of humans, geography was as easy a start as I could have wished for. The teacher was helpful, I was able to keep up with most of what was being discussed, and I thought I'd be able to catch up with the rest of the class within a few weeks.</p><p>Maths, which came next, was a different matter entirely. I knew after five minutes that I was in trouble. I'd covered only basic maths in school, and had forgotten most of the little I used to know. I could divide and multiply, but that was as far as my expertise stretched - which, I quickly discovered, wasn't nearly far enough.</p><p>\"What do you mean, you've never done algebra?\" my teacher, a fierce man by the name of Mr. Smarts, snapped. \"Of course you have! Don't take me for a fool, lad. I know you're new, but don't think that means you can get away with murder. Open that book to page sixteen and do the first set of problems. I'll collect your work at the end of class and see where you stand.\"</p><p>Where I stood was outside in the cold, a hundred kilometres distant. I couldn't even read the problems on page sixteen, never mind solve them! I looked through the earlier pages and tried copying the examples set there, but I hadn't a clue what I was doing. When Mr. Smarts took my copy from me and said he'd check it during lunch and return it to me that afternoon in science - I had him for that as well - I was too downhearted to thank him for his promptness.</p>","<p>Break was no better. I spent the ten minutes wandering alone, being stared at by everyone in the yard. I tried making friends with some of the people I recognized from my first two classes, but they wanted nothing to do with me. I looked, smelt and acted weird, and there was something not right about me. The teachers hadn't sussed me out yet, but the kids had. They knew I didn't belong.</p><p>Even if my fellow students had tried making me feel welcome, I'd have struggled to adapt. I knew nothing of the films and TV shows they were discussing, or the rock stars or styles of music, or the books and comics. Their way of speaking was strange too - I couldn't understand a lot of their slang.</p><p>I had history after the break. That used to be one of my favourite subjects, but this syllabus was far more advanced than mine had been. The class was focusing on World War II, which was what I'd been studying during my last few months as a human. Back then I'd only had to learn the major events of the war, and the leaders of the various countries. But as a fifteen year old, who'd supposedly progressed through the system, I was expected to know the detailed ins and outs of battles, the names of generals, the wide-ranging social effects of the war, and so on.</p><p>I told my teacher I'd been concentrating on ancient history in my old school, and complimented myself on such a clever answer - but then she said there was a small class of ancient history students at Mahler's and she'd get me transferred first thing tomorrow.</p><p>Ai-yi-yi-yi-yi!</p><p>English next. I was dreading it. I could bluff my way through subjects like geography and history, by saying I'd been following a different syllabus. But how was I going to explain my shortcomings in English? I could pretend not to have read all the books and poems that the others had, but what would happen when my teacher asked what I'd read instead? I was doomed!</p><p>There was a free table close to the front of the class, where I had to sit. Our teacher was late - because of the size of the school, teachers and pupils often arrived slightly late for class. I spent a couple of minutes anxiously scanning the book of poetry I'd bought last Friday, desperately committing a few scraps of random poems to memory, in the hope that I could fob the teacher off with them.</p><p>The door to the classroom opened, the noise level dropped, and everyone stood up. \"Sit down, sit down,\" the teacher said, making straight for her desk, where she laid her stack of books. Facing the class, she smiled and brushed her hair back. She was a young, pretty black woman. \"I hear we've a new addition,\" she said, looking around the room for me. \"Will you stand up please, so I can identify you?\"</p><p>Standing, I raised a hand and smiled edgily. \"Here,\" I said.</p><p>\"Close to the front,\" she beamed. \"A good sign. Now, I have your name and details written down somewhere. Just give me a minute and I'll...\"</p><p>She was turning aside to look among her books and papers, when all of a sudden she stopped as though slapped, glanced sharply at me and took a step forward. Her face lit up and she exclaimed, \"Darren Shan?\"</p><p>\"Um. Yes.\" I smiled nervously. I'd no idea who she was, and was scouring my memory banks - was she staying in the same hotel as me? - when something about the shape of her mouth and eyes jogged a switch inside my brain. Leaving my table, I took several steps towards her, until we were only a metre apart, then studied her face incredulously. \"Debbie?\" I gasped. \"Debbie Hemlock?\"</p><p>Chapter SIX</p><p>\"DARREN!\" DEBBIE squealed, throwing her arms around me.</p><p>\"Debbie!\" I whooped and hugged her hard.</p><p>My English teacher was Debbie Hemlock - my ex-girlfriend!</p><p>\"You've barely changed!\" Debbie gasped.</p><p>\"You look so different!\" I laughed.</p><p>\"What happened to your face?\"</p><p>\"How did you become a teacher?\"</p><p>Then, together: \"What are you doing here?\"</p><p>We stopped, wide-eyed, beaming madly. We were no longer hugging, but our hands were joined. Around us, my fellow students gawped as though they were witnessing the end of the universe.</p><p>\"Where have...\" Debbie started, then glanced around. Realizing we were the centre of attention, she let go of my hands and smiled sheepishly. \"Darren and I are old friends,\" she explained to the class. \"We haven't seen each other in...\"</p><p>Again she stopped, this time with a frown. \"Excuse us,\" she muttered, grabbing my right hand and roughly leading the way outside. Closing the door, she swung me up against a wall, checked to make sure we were alone in the hall, leant in close and hissed, \"Where the hell have you been all these years?\"</p><p>\"Here and there,\" I smiled, eyes roving her face, stunned by how much she'd changed. She was taller too - even taller than me now.</p><p>\"Why is your face the same?\" she snapped. \"You look almost exactly as I remember you. You've aged a year or two, but it's been thirteen years!\"</p><p>\"How time flies,\" I smirked, then stole a quick kiss. \"Good to see you again, Miss Hemlock.\"</p><p>Debbie froze at the kiss, then took a step back. \"Don't do that.\"</p><p>\"Sorry. Just glad to see you.\"</p><p>\"I'm glad to see you too. But if anyone sees me kissing a student...\"</p><p>\"Oh, Debbie, I'm not really a student. You know that. I'm old enough to be... Well, you know how old I am.\"</p><p>\"I thought I did. But your face...\" She traced the outline of my jaw, then my lips and nose, then the small triangular scar above my right eye. \"You've been in the wars,\" she noted.</p><p>\"You wouldn't believe it if I told you how right you are,\" I smiled.</p><p>\"Darren Shan.\" She shook her head and repeated my name. \"Darren Shan.\"</p><p>Then she slapped me!</p><p>\"What's that for?\" I yelped.</p><p>\"For leaving without saying goodbye and ruining my Christmas,\" she growled.</p><p>\"That was thirteen years ago. Surely you're not still upset about it.\"</p><p>\"The Hemlocks can carry a grudge a long, long time,\" she said, but there was the glint of a smile in her eyes.</p><p>\"I did leave you a going-away present,\" I said.</p><p>For a moment her face was blank. Then she remembered. \"The tree!\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley and me had killed the mad vampaneze - Murlough - in Debbie's house on Christmas Eve, after using her as bait to lure him out of his lair. Before leaving, I'd placed a small Christmas tree by her bedside and decorated it (I'd drugged Debbie and her parents earlier, so they were unconscious when Murlough attacked).</p>","<p>\"I'd forgotten about the tree,\" she muttered. \"Which brings us to another point - what happened back then? One moment we were sitting down to dinner, the next I woke up in bed and it was late Christmas Day. Mum and Dad woke in their beds too, with no idea of how they got there.\"</p><p>\"How are Donna and Jesse?\" I asked, trying to avoid her question.</p><p>\"Fine. Dad's still travelling the world, going wherever his work takes him, and Mum's started a new... No,\" she said, prodding me in the chest. \"Forget what's been going on with me. I want to know what's up with you. For thirteen years you've been a fond memory. I tried finding you a few times, but you'd vanished without a trace. Now you waltz back into my life, looking as though the years had been months. I want to know what gives.\"</p><p>\"It's a long story,\" I sighed. \"And complicated.\"</p><p>\"I've got time,\" she sniffed.</p><p>\"No, you haven't,\" I contradicted her, nodding at the closed classroom door.</p><p>\"Damn. I forgot about them.\" She strode to the door and opened it. The kids inside had been talking loudly, but they stopped at the sight of their teacher. \"Get out your books!\" she snapped. \"I'll be with you presently.\" Facing me again, she said, \"You're right - we don't have time. And my schedule's full for the rest of the day - I've a teachers' meeting to attend during lunch. But we have to get together soon and talk.\"</p><p>\"How about after school?\" I suggested. \"I'll go home, change clothes, and we can meet... where?\"</p><p>\"My place,\" Debbie said. \"I live on the third floor of an apartment block. 3c, Bungrove Drive. It's about a ten-minute walk from here.\"</p><p>\"I'll find it.\"</p><p>\"But give me a couple of hours to correct homework,\" she said. \"Don't come before half-six.\"</p><p>\"Sounds perfect.\"</p><p>\"Darren Shan,\" she whispered, a small smile lifting the corners of her mouth. \"Who'd have believed it?\" She leant towards me, and I thought - hoped! - she was going to kiss me, but then she stopped, adopted a stern expression and pushed me back into class ahead of her.</p><p>The lesson passed in a blur. Debbie tried hard not to pay special attention to me, but our eyes kept meeting and we were unable to stop smiling. The others kids noted the remarkable bond between us and it was the talk of the school by lunchtime. If the students had been suspicious of me at the start of the day, now they were downright wary, and everyone gave me a wide berth.</p><p>I breezed through the later classes. It didn't bother me that I was out of my depth and ignorant of the subject matter. I no longer cared or tried to act clued up. Debbie was all I could think about. Even when Mr. Smarts threw my maths copy at me in science and bawled furiously, I only smiled, nodded and tuned him out.</p><p>At the end of the day I rushed back to the hotel. I'd been given the key to a locker, where I was supposed to leave my books, but I was so excited I didn't bother with it, and carried the full bag of books home with me. Mr. Crepsley was still in bed when I arrived, but Harkat was awake, and I hurriedly told him about my day and meeting Debbie.</p><p>\"Isn't it wonderful?\" I finished breathlessly. \"Isn't it incredible? Isn't it the most...\" I couldn't think of any way to describe it, so I simply threw my hands into the air and yelled, \"Yahoo!\"</p><p>\"It's great,\" Harkat said, wide mouth spreading into a jagged smile, but he didn't sound happy.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" I asked, reading the unease in his round green eyes.</p><p>\"Nothing,\" he said. \"It's great. Really. I'm thrilled for you.\"</p><p>\"Don't lie to me, Harkat. Something's bugging you. What?\"</p><p>He came out with it. \"Doesn't this seem a bit... too coincidental?\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\"</p><p>\"Of all the schools you could have gone to... all the teachers in the world... you end up at the one where your... old girlfriend's teaching? And in her class?\"</p><p>\"Life's like that, Harkat. Strange things happen all the time.\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" the Little Person agreed. \"And sometimes they happen... by chance. But other times they're... arranged.\"</p><p>I'd been unbuttoning my shirt, having slipped off my jumper and tie. Now I paused, fingers on the buttons, and studied him. \"What are you saying?\"</p><p>\"Something smells rotten. If you'd run into Debbie in the street, that... would be something else. But you're in her class at a school where... you shouldn't be. Somebody set you up to go to Mahler's, someone who... knows about Murlough, and about your past.\"</p><p>\"You think the person who forged our signatures knew Debbie was working at Mahler's?\" I asked.</p><p>\"That's obvious,\" Harkat said. \"And that in itself is cause for worry. But there's something else we... must consider. What if the person who set you up didn't... just know about Debbie - what if it was Debbie?\"</p><p>Chapter SEVEN</p><p>I COULDN'T believe Debbie was in league with the vampaneze or Mr. Tiny, or had played any part in setting me up to go to Mahler's. I told Harkat how stunned she'd been to see me, but he said she might have been acting. \"If she went to all the trouble of getting... you there, she'd hardly not act surprised,\" he noted.</p><p>I shook my head stubbornly. \"She wouldn't do something like this.\"</p><p>\"I don't know her, so I can't voice... an opinion. But you don't really know her either. She was a child when you... last saw her. People change as they grow.\"</p><p>\"You don't think I should trust her?\"</p><p>\"I'm not saying that. Maybe she's genuine. Maybe she had nothing to do with faking the... forms, or with you being there - it could be a... huge coincidence. But caution is required. Go see her, but keep an eye... on her. Be careful what you say. Put some probing questions to her. And take a weapon.\"</p><p>\"I couldn't hurt her,\" I said quietly. \"Even if she has plotted against us, there's no way I could kill her.\"</p><p>\"Take one anyway,\" Harkat insisted. \"If she's working with the vampaneze, it may not be... her you have to use it on.\"</p><p>\"You reckon the vampaneze could be lying in wait there?\"</p><p>\"Maybe. We couldn't understand why... the vampaneze - if they're behind the fake forms - would send you... to school. If they're working with Debbie - or using... her - this might explain it.\"</p>","<p>\"You mean they want to get me at Debbie's alone, so they can pick me off?\"</p><p>\"They might.\"</p><p>I nodded thoughtfully. I didn't believe Debbie was working with our foes, but it was possible that they were manipulating her to get to me. \"How should we handle this?\" I asked.</p><p>Harkat's green eyes betrayed his uncertainty. \"I'm not sure. It would be foolish to walk into... a trap. But sometimes risks must be taken. Perhaps this is our way to flush out... those who would ensnare us.\"</p><p>Chewing my lower lip, I brooded upon it a while, then followed the most sensible course of action - I went and woke Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>I rang the bell for 3c and waited. A moment later, Debbie's voice came over the intercom. \"Darren?\"</p><p>\"The one and only.\"</p><p>\"You're late.\" It was twenty past seven. The sun was setting.</p><p>\"Got stuck doing homework. Blame my English teacher - she's a real dragon.\"</p><p>\"Ha-flaming-ha.\"</p><p>There was a buzzing noise and the door opened. I paused before entering and looked across the street at the opposite block of apartments. I spotted a lurking shadow on the roof - Mr. Crepsley. Harkat was behind Debbie's building. Both would rush to my rescue at the first sign of trouble. That was the plan we'd hatched. Mr. Crepsley had suggested beating a hasty retreat - things were getting too complicated for his liking - but when I pulled rank, he'd agreed to make the most of the situation and attempt to turn the tables on our opponents - if they showed.</p><p>\"If a fight develops,\" he warned me before setting out, \"it may not be possible to choose targets. You are not prepared to raise a hand against your friend, but I am, if she is working with the enemy. Do not get in my way if that happens.\"</p><p>I nodded grimly. I wasn't sure I could stand by and let him harm Debbie, even if it turned out that she was conspiring against us - but I'd try.</p><p>Trotting up the stairs, I was painfully aware of the two knives I was carrying, strapped to my calves so as not to show. I hoped I wouldn't have to use them, but it was good to know they were there if needed.</p><p>The door to 3c was open, but I knocked before entering. \"Come in,\" Debbie called. \"I'm in the kitchen.\"</p><p>I closed the door but didn't lock it. Quickly scanned the apartment. Very tidy. Several bookcases, overflowing with books. A CD player and stand; lots of CDs. A portable TV set. A cover poster of The Lord of the Rings on one wall, a picture of Debbie with her parents on another.</p><p>Debbie stepped in from the kitchen. She was wearing a long red apron and there was flour in her hair. \"I got bored waiting for you,\" she said, \"so I started to make scones. Do you like yours with currants or without?\"</p><p>\"Without,\" I said and smiled as she ducked back into the kitchen - killers and their cohorts don't greet you with flour in their hair! Any half-doubts I had about Debbie quickly vanished and I knew I'd nothing to fear from her. But I didn't drop my guard - Debbie didn't pose a threat, but there might be vampaneze in the room next door or hovering on the fire escape.</p><p>\"How did you enjoy your first day at school?\" Debbie asked, as I wandered round the living room.</p><p>\"It was strange. I haven't been inside a school since... Well, it's been a long time. So much has changed. When I was...\" I stopped. The cover of a book had caught my eye: The Three Musketeers. \"Is Donna still making you read this?\"</p><p>Debbie poked her head through the doorway and looked at the book. \"Oh,\" she laughed. \"I was reading that when we first met, wasn't I?\"</p><p>\"Yep. You hated it.\"</p><p>\"Really? That's odd - I love it now. It's one of my favourites. I recommend it to my pupils all the time.\"</p><p>Shaking my head wryly, I laid the book down and went to view the kitchen. It was small, but professionally organized. There was a lovely smell of fresh dough. \"Donna taught you well,\" I remarked. Debbie's mum used to be a chef.</p><p>\"She wouldn't let me leave home until I could run a good kitchen,\" Debbie smiled. \"Graduating university was easier than passing the tests she set.\"</p><p>\"You've been to university?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I'd hardly be teaching if I hadn't.\"</p><p>Laying a tray of unbaked scones into a petite oven, she switched off the light and motioned me back to the living room. As I flopped into one of the soft chairs she went to the CD stand and looked for something to play. \"Any preferences?\"</p><p>\"Not really.\"</p><p>\"I don't have much in the way of pop or rock. Jazz or classical?\"</p><p>\"I don't mind.\"</p><p>Choosing a CD, she took it out of its case, inserted it in the player and turned it on. She stood by the player a couple of minutes while flowing, lifting music filled the air. \"Like it?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Not bad. What is it?\"</p><p>\"The Titan. Do you know who it's by?\"</p><p>\"Mahler?\" I guessed.</p><p>\"Right. I thought I'd play it for you, so you're familiar with it - Mr. Chivers gets very upset if his students don't recognize Mahler.\" Taking the chair next to mine, Debbie studied my face in silence. I felt uncomfortable, but didn't turn away. \"So,\" she sighed. \"Want to tell me about it?\"</p><p>I'd discussed what I should tell her with Mr. Crepsley and Harkat, and quickly launched into the story we'd settled upon. I said I was the victim of an ageing disease, which meant I aged slower than normal people. I reminded her of the snake-boy, Evra Von, whom she'd met, and said the two of us were patients at a special clinic.</p><p>\"You aren't brothers?\" she asked.</p><p>\"No. And the man we were with wasn't our father - he was a nurse at the hospital. That's why I never let you meet him - it was fun, having you think I was an ordinary person, and I didn't want him giving the game away.\"</p><p>\"So how old are you?\" she enquired.</p><p>\"Not much older than you,\" I said. \"The disease didn't set in until I was twelve. I wasn't very different to other children until then.\"</p><p>She considered that in her careful, thoughtful manner. \"If that's true,\" she said, \"what are you doing in school now? And why pick mine?\"</p><p>\"I didn't know you were working at Mahler's,\" I said. \"That's a freak occurrence. I've returned to school because... It's hard to explain. I didn't get a proper education when I was growing up. I was rebellious and spent a lot of time off fishing or playing football when I should have been learning. Lately I've been feeling like I missed out. A few weeks ago I met a man who forges papers - passports, birth certificates, stuff like that. I asked him to set me up with a fake ID, so I could pretend I was fifteen.\"</p>","<p>\"Whatever for?\" Debbie asked. \"Why didn't you go to an adult night school?\"</p><p>\"Because, looks-wise, I'm not an adult.\" I pulled a sad face. \"You don't know how miserable it gets, growing so slowly, explaining myself to strangers, knowing they're talking about me. I don't mingle much. I live alone and stay indoors most of the time. I felt this was an opportunity to pretend I was normal. I thought I could fit in with the people I most resemble - fifteen year olds. I hoped, if I dressed and talked like them, and went to school with them, maybe they'd accept me and I wouldn't feel so lonely.\" Lowering my gaze; I added mournfully, \"I guess the pretence stops now.\"</p><p>There was a silent beat. Another. Then Debbie said, \"Why should it?\"</p><p>\"Because you know about me. You'll tell Mr. Chivers. I'll have to leave.\"</p><p>Debbie reached across and took my left hand in hers. \"I think you're crazy,\" she said. \"Practically everyone I know couldn't wait to leave school, and here you are, desperate to return. But I admire you for this. I think it's great that you want to learn. I think you're very brave, and I won't say anything about it.\"</p><p>\"Really?\"</p><p>\"I think you'll be found out eventually - an act like this is impossible to sustain - but I won't blow the whistle on you.\"</p><p>\"Thanks, Debbie. I...\" Clearing my throat, I looked at our joined hands. \"I'd like to kiss you - to thank you - but I don't know if you want me to.\"</p><p>Debbie frowned, and I could see what she was thinking - was it acceptable for a teacher to let one of her pupils kiss her? Then she chuckled and said, \"OK - but just on my cheek.\"</p><p>Lifting my head, I leant over and brushed her cheek with my lips. I would have liked to kiss her properly, but knew I couldn't. Although we were of similar ages, in her eyes I was still a teenager. There was a line between us we couldn't step over - much as the adult within me hungered to cross it.</p><p>We talked for hours. I learnt all about Debbie's life, how she'd gone to university after school, studied English and sociology, graduated and went on to become a teacher. After a few part-time appointments elsewhere, she'd applied for a number of permanent positions here - she'd seen out her schooldays in this city, and felt it was the nearest place she had to a home. She ended up at Mahler's. She'd been there two years and loved it. There'd been men in her life - she'd been engaged at one stage! - but none at the moment. And she said - very pointedly - that she wasn't looking for any either!</p><p>She asked me about that night thirteen years ago and what had happened to her and her parents. I lied and said there'd been something wrong with the wine. \"You all fell asleep at the table. I rang for the nurse who was looking after Evra and me. He came, checked, said you were OK and would be fine when you woke. We put the three of you to bed and I slipped away. I've never been good at saying farewell.\"</p><p>I told Debbie I was living alone. If she checked with Mr. Blaws, she'd know that was a lie, but I didn't think ordinary teachers mixed much with inspectors.</p><p>\"It's going to be bizarre having you in my class,\" she murmured. We were sitting on the couch. \"We'll have to be careful. If anyone suspects there was ever anything between us, we must tell the truth. It'd mean my career if we didn't.\"</p><p>\"Maybe it's a problem we won't have to worry about much longer,\" I said.</p><p>\"What do you mean?\"</p><p>\"I don't think I'm cut out for school. I'm behind in all the subjects. In some - maths and science - I'm not even within sighting distance of everyone else. I think I'll have to drop out.\"</p><p>\"That's quitting talk,\" she growled, \"and I won't stand for it.\" She popped one of the scones - they were chestnut brown, smeared with butter and jam - into my mouth and made me munch on it. \"Finish what you start or you'll regret it.\"</p><p>\"Buh I cahn't duh iht,\" I mumbled, mouth full of scone.</p><p>\"Of course you can,\" she insisted. \"It won't be easy. You'll have to study hard, maybe get some private tuition...\" She stopped and her face lit up. \"That's it!\"</p><p>\"What?\" I asked.</p><p>\"You can come to me for lessons.\"</p><p>\"What sort of lessons?\"</p><p>She punched my arm. \"School lessons, you ninny! You can come round for an hour or two after school every day. I'll help you with your homework and fill you in on stuff you've missed.\"</p><p>\"You wouldn't mind?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Of course not,\" she smiled. \"It will be a pleasure.\"</p><p>Enjoyable as the night was, it had to end eventually. I'd forgotten about the possible threat of the vampaneze, but when Debbie excused herself and went to the bathroom, I fell to thinking about them, and wondered if Mr. Crepsley or Harkat had sighted any - I didn't want to come to Debbie's for lessons if it meant getting her mixed up in our dangerous affairs.</p><p>If I waited for her to return, I might forget about the threat again, so I composed a quick note - 'Have to go. Wonderful to see you. Meet you at school in the morning. Hope you won't mind if I don't do my homework! - left it on the bare plate which had contained the scones, and ducked out as quietly as possible.</p><p>I trotted down the stairs, humming happily, paused outside the main door at the bottom and let rip with three long whistles - my signal to Mr. Crepsley to let him know that I was leaving. Then I made my way round to the back of the building and found Harkat hiding behind a couple of large black rubbish bins. \"Any trouble?\" I asked.</p><p>\"None,\" he replied. \"Nobody's gone near the place.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley arrived and crouched behind the bins with us. He looked more solemn than usual. \"Spot any vampaneze?\" I asked.</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"Mr. Tiny?\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"Things are looking good then,\" I smiled.</p><p>\"What about Debbie?\" Harkat asked. \"Is she on the level?\"</p><p>\"Oh, yes.\" I gave them a quick account of my conversation with Debbie. Mr. Crepsley said nothing, only grunted as I filled him in. He appeared very moody and distant.</p><p>\"... so we've arranged to meet each evening after school,\" I finished. \"We haven't set a time yet. I wanted to discuss it with you two first, to see if you want to shadow us when we meet. I don't think there's any need - I'm sure Debbie isn't part of a plot - but if you want, we can schedule the lessons for late at night.\"</p>","<p>Mr. Crepsley sighed half-heartedly. \"I do not think that will be necessary. I have scouted the area thoroughly. There is no evidence of the vampaneze. It would be preferable if you came in daylight, but not essential.\"</p><p>\"Is that a seal of approval?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" Again he sounded unusually downhearted.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" I asked. \"You're not still suspicious of Debbie, are you?\"</p><p>\"It has nothing to do with her. I...\" He looked at us sadly. \"I have bad news.\"</p><p>\"Oh?\" Harkat and me exchanged uncertain glances.</p><p>\"Mika Ver Leth transmitted a short telepathic message to me while you were inside.\"</p><p>\"Is this about the Lord of the Vampaneze?\" I asked nervously.</p><p>\"No. It is about our friend, your fellow Prince, Paris Skyle. He...\" Mr. Crepsley sighed again, then said dully, \"Paris is dead.\"</p><p>Chapter EIGHT</p><p>THE DEATH of the ancient Prince should have come as no great surprise - he was the wrong side of eight hundred, the War of the Scars had taken its toll on him, and I remembered thinking when I left Vampire Mountain how poorly he looked - but I hadn't expected him to go this quickly, and the news knocked the wind out of me.</p><p>As far as Mr. Crepsley knew, the Prince had died of natural causes. He wouldn't be sure until he got to Vampire Mountain - vampires could only send basic telepathic messages - but there'd been no hint of foul play in Mika's message.</p><p>I wanted to go with him to the funeral - it would be a huge affair, which almost every vampire in the world would attend - but Mr. Crepsley asked me not to. \"One Prince must always remain absent from Vampire Mountain,\" he reminded me, \"in case anything happens to the others. I know you were fond of Paris, but Mika, Arrow and Vancha knew him far longer than you. It would be unfair to ask one of them to give up their place.\"</p><p>I was disappointed, but bowed to his wishes - it would have been selfish of me to put myself before the elder Princes. \"Tell them to be careful,\" I warned him. \"I don't want to be the only Prince left - if they all perished together, and I had to lead the clan by myself, it would be a disaster!\"</p><p>\"You can say that again,\" Harkat laughed, but there was no merriment in his voice. \"Can I come with you?\" he asked Mr. Crepsley. \"I'd like to pay... my respects.\"</p><p>\"I would rather you remained with Darren,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"I do not like the idea of leaving him on his own.\"</p><p>Harkat nodded immediately. \"You're right. I'll stay.\"</p><p>\"Thanks,\" I said softly.</p><p>\"Now,\" Mr. Crepsley mused, \"that leaves us with the question of whether you hold camp here or locate elsewhere.\"</p><p>\"We'll stay, of course,\" I said rather quickly.</p><p>Morose as he was, the vampire managed a wry smile. \"I thought you would say that. I glimpsed you through the window as you kissed your teachers cheek.\"</p><p>\"You were spying on me!\" I huffed.</p><p>\"That was the general idea, was it not?\" he replied. I sputtered indignantly, but of course that had been the plan. \"You and Harkat should withdraw while I am away,\" Mr. Crepsley continued. \"If you come under attack, you will be hard-pushed to defend yourselves.\"</p><p>\"I'm ready to risk it if Harkat is,\" I said.</p><p>Harkat shrugged. \"The thought of staying doesn't... frighten me.\"</p><p>\"Very well,\" Mr. Crepsley sighed. \"But promise me you will abandon the search for the killers while I am absent, and do nothing to endanger yourselves.\"</p><p>\"You've no fear on that score,\" I told him. \"Chasing killers is the last thing an my mind. I've something far more terrifying to deal with - homework!\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley wished us well, then hurried back to the hotel to gather his belongings and depart. He was gone when we got there, probably already at the edge of the city, getting ready to flit. It felt lonely without him, and a little bit scary, but we weren't too worried. He should only be gone a few weeks at most. What could possibly go wrong in so short a time?</p><p>The next fortnight was tough. With Mr. Crepsley out of the city, the hunt for the vampaneze suspended, and the death count stable (nobody new had been killed recently), I was able to concentrate on school - which was just as well, given the amount of work I had to put into it.</p><p>Debbie pulled some strings to lighten my load. Guided by her, I played up the effects of the imaginary fire I'd been trapped in and said I'd missed a lot of school. I explained the good marks by saying my father had been best friends with the headmaster of my old school. Mr. Chivers was decidedly unimpressed when he heard that, but Debbie convinced him not to take matters further.</p><p>I opted out of modern languages and dropped back a couple of years in maths and science. I felt more peculiar than ever sitting amidst a bunch of thirteen year olds, but at least I was able to follow what they were doing. I still had Mr. Smarts for science, but he was more understanding now that he knew I hadn't been faking ignorance, and spent a lot of time helping me catch up.</p><p>I faced difficulties in English, history and geography, but with the extra free periods I had instead of languages, I was able to focus on them and was gradually pulling even with the others in my class.</p><p>I enjoyed mechanical drawing and computer studies. My Dad had taught me the basics of MD when I was a kid - he'd hoped I'd go into draughtsmanship when I grew up - and I quickly picked up on what I'd missed. To my surprise, I took to computers like a vampire to blood, aided by my super-fast fingers, which could speed about a keyboard faster than any human typist's.</p><p>I had to keep a close watch on my powers. I was finding it hard to make friends - my classmates were still suspicious of me - but I knew I could become popular if I took part in the lunchtime sporting activities. I could shine in any game - football, basketball, handball - and everyone likes a winner. The temptation to show off, and earn a few friends in the process, was strong.</p><p>But I resisted. The risk was too great. It wasn't just the possibility that I'd do something superhuman - like leap higher than a professional basketball player - which might tip people off to my powers, but the fear that I might injure somebody. If someone dug me in the ribs while playing football, I might lose my temper and take a punch at him, and my punches could put a human in hospital, or worse - a morgue!</p><p>PE was therefore a frustrating class - I had to deliberately mask my strength behind a clumsy, pathetic facade. English, oddly enough, was a pain too. It was great to be with Debbie, but when we were in class we had to act like an ordinary teacher and student. There could be no undue familiarity. We maintained a cool, distant air, which made the forty minutes - eighty on Wednesdays and Fridays, when I had double English - pass with agonizing slowness.</p>","<p>After school and at weekends, when I went round to her apartment for private tuition, it was different. There we could relax and discuss whatever we wanted; we could curl up on the couch with a bottle of wine and watch an old film on the TV, or listen to music and chat about the past.</p><p>I ate at Debbie's most nights. She loved cooking, and we experimented with a variety of culinary feasts. I soon put on weight, and had to go jogging late at night to keep myself trim.</p><p>But it wasn't all relaxation and good food with Debbie. She was determined to educate me to a satisfactory level and spent two or three hours every evening working on my subjects with me. It wasn't easy for her - apart from being tired after her day at work, she didn't know a lot about maths, science and geography - but she stuck with it and set an example which I felt compelled to follow.</p><p>\"Your grammar's shaky,\" she said one night, reading through an essay I'd written, \"Your English is good but you have some bad habits you need to break.\"</p><p>\"Such as?\"</p><p>\"This sentence, for instance: 'John and me went to the store to buy a magazine. What's wrong with that?\"</p><p>I thought about it. \"We went to buy newspapers?\" I suggested innocently.</p><p>Debbie threw the copy at me. \"Seriously,\" she giggled.</p><p>I picked up the copy and studied the sentence. \"It should be 'John and I'?\" I guessed.</p><p>\"Yes,\" she nodded. \"You use 'and me' all the time. It's not grammatically correct. You'll have to rise out of it.\"</p><p>\"I know,\" I sighed. \"But it'll be tough. I keep a diary, and for the last fifteen years I've been using 'and me' - it just seems more natural.\"</p><p>\"Nobody ever said English was natural,\" Debbie scolded me, then cocked an eyebrow and added, \"I didn't know you kept a diary.\"</p><p>\"I've kept one since I was nine years old. All my secrets are in it.\"</p><p>\"I hope you don't write about me. If it fell into the wrong hands...\"</p><p>\"Hmm,\" I smirked. \"I could blackmail you if I wanted, couldn't I?\"</p><p>\"Just try it,\" she growled. Then, earnestly, \"I really don't think you should write about us, Darren. Or if you do, use a code, or invent a name for me. Diaries can be misplaced, and if word of our friendship leaked, I'd have a hard time setting things straight.\"</p><p>\"OK. I haven't included any new entries lately - I've been too busy- but when I do, I'll exercise due discretion.\" That was one of Debbie's pet phrases.</p><p>\"And make sure when you're describing us that it's 'Miss X and I', not 'Miss X and me,\" she said pompously, then screeched as I pounced across the room and set about tickling her until her face turned red!</p><p>Chapter NINE</p><p>ON MY third Tuesday at school, I made a friend. Richard Montrose was a small, mousey-haired boy, whom I recognized from my English and history classes. He was a year younger than most of the others. He didn't say very much, but was always being complimented by the teachers. Which of course made him the perfect target for bullies.</p><p>Since I didn't take part in games on the quad, I spent most of my lunch breaks strolling around, or in the computer room on the third floor of the building at the rear of the school. That's where I was when I heard sounds of a scuffle outside and went to investigate I found Richard pinned to the wall by Smickey Martin - the guy who'd called me an asswipe on my first day at school - and three of his pals. Smickey was rooting through the younger boy's pockets. \"You know you have to pay, Monty,\" he laughed. \"If we don't take yer money, someone else will. Better the devil you know than the devil you don't.\"</p><p>\"Please, Smickey,\" Richard sobbed. \"Not this week. I have to buy a new atlas.\"</p><p>\"Should have taken more care of your old one,\" Smickey snickered.</p><p>\"You're the one who ripped it up, you...\" Richard was on the point of calling Smickey something awful, but drew up short.</p><p>Smickey paused threateningly. \"Wot was you gonna call me, Monty?\"</p><p>\"Nothing,\" Richard gasped, truly frightened now.</p><p>\"Yes, you was,\" Smickey snarled. \"Hold him, boys. I'm gonna teach him a-\"</p><p>\"You'll teach him nothing,\" I said quietly from behind.</p><p>Smickey turned swiftly. When he saw me, he laughed. \"Little Darrsy Horston,\" he chuckled. \"Wot are you doing here?\" I didn't answer, only stared coldly at him. \"Better run along, Horsty,\" Smickey said. \"We ain't come after you for money yet - but that's not to say we won't!\"</p><p>\"You won't get anything from me,\" I told him. \"And you won't get anything from Richard in future either. Or anyone else.\"</p><p>\"Oh?\" His eyes narrowed. \"Them's awful big words, Horsty. If you take 'em back quick, I might forget you said em.</p><p>I stepped forward calmly, relishing the chance to put this bully in his place. Smickey frowned - he hadn't been expecting an open challenge - then grinned, grabbed Richard's left arm and swung him towards me. I stepped aside as Richard cried out - I was fully focused on Smickey - but then I heard him collide with something hard. Glancing back, I saw that he'd slammed into the banisters of the stairs and was toppling over - about to fall head first to the floor three storeys below!</p><p>I threw myself backwards and snatched for Richard's feet. I missed his left foot but got a couple of fingers on his right ankle just before he disappeared over the side of the handrail. Gripping the fabric of his school trousers hard, I grunted as the weight of his body jerked me roughly against the banisters. There was a ripping sound, and I feared his trousers would tear and I'd lose him. But the material held, and as he hung over the railings, whimpering, I hauled him back up and set him on his feet.</p><p>When Richard was safe, I turned to deal with Smickey Martin and the rest, but they'd scattered like the cowards they were. \"So much for that lot,\" I muttered, then asked Richard if he was OK. He nodded feebly but said nothing. I left him where he was and returned to the soft hum of the computer room.</p><p>Moments later, Richard appeared in the doorway. He was still shaking, but he was smiling also. \"You saved my life,\" he said. I shrugged and stared at the screen as though immersed in it. Richard waited a few seconds, then said, \"Thanks.\"</p><p>\"No problem.\" I glanced up at him. \"Three floors isn't that big a fall. You'd probably only have broken a few bones.\"</p>","<p>\"I don't think so,\" Richard said. \"I was going nose-down, like a plane.\" He sat beside me and studied the screen. \"Creating a screen saver?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"I know where to find some really good scenes from sci-fi and horror movies. Want me to show you?\"</p><p>I nodded. \"That'd be cool.\"</p><p>Smiling, his fingers flew over the keyboard and soon we were discussing school and homework and computers, and the rest of the lunch break whizzed by.</p><p>Richard swapped seats in English and history in order to sit beside me, and let me copy from his notes - he had his own shorthand system which allowed him to jot down everything that was said in class. He also started spending most of his breaks and lunches with me. He pulled me out of the computer room and introduced me to other friends of his. They didn't exactly welcome me with open arms, but at least I had a few people to talk to now.</p><p>It was fun hanging out, discussing TV, comics, music, books and (of course!) girls. Harkat and me - Harkat and I - had TV sets in our rooms at the hotel, and I started watching a few programmes at night. Most of the stuff my new friends enjoyed was formulaic and tedious, but I pretended to enthuse about it like they did.</p><p>The week passed swiftly and before I knew it I was facing another weekend. For the first time I was mildly disappointed to have two free days on my hands - Richard would be away at his grandparents' - but cheered up at the thought of spending them with Debbie.</p><p>I'd been thinking a lot about Debbie, and the bond between us. We'd been very close as teenagers, and I now felt closer to her than ever. I knew there were obstacles - especially my appearance - but having spent so much time with her, I now believed we could overcome those obstacles and pick up where we'd left off thirteen years before.</p><p>That Friday night, I summoned all my courage as we were sitting together on the couch, leant over and tried to kiss Debbie. She looked surprised, and pushed me away lightly, laughing uneasily. When I tried to kiss her again, her surprise turned to icy anger and she shoved me away firmly. \"No!\" she snapped.</p><p>\"Why not?\" I retorted, upset.</p><p>\"I'm your teacher,\" Debbie said, standing. \"You're my student. It wouldn't be right.\"</p><p>\"I don't want to be your student,\" I growled, standing up beside her. \"I want to be your boyfriend.\"</p><p>I leant forward to kiss her again, but before I could, she slapped me hard. I blinked and stared at her, stunned. She slapped me again, softer this time. She was trembling and there were tears in her eyes.</p><p>\"Debbie,\" I groaned, \"I didn't mean to-\"</p><p>\"I want you to leave now,\" Debbie said. I took a couple of steps back, then halted. I opened my mouth to protest. \"No,\" Debbie said. \"Don't say anything. Just go, please.\"</p><p>Nodding miserably, I turned my back on her and walked to the door. I paused with my fingers on the handle and spoke to her without looking back. \"I only wanted to be closer to you. I didn't mean any harm.\"</p><p>After short silence Debbie sighed and said, \"I know.\"</p><p>I risked a quick look back - Debbie had her arms crossed over her chest and was gazing down at the floor. She was close to crying. \"Does this change things between us?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" she answered honestly. She glanced up at me and I could see confusion mingled in her eyes with the tears. \"Let's leave it for a couple of days. We'll talk about this on Monday. I need to think it over.\"</p><p>\"OK.\" I opened the door, took a step out, then said very quickly, \"You might not want to hear this, but I love you, Debbie. I love you more than anybody else in the world.\" Before she could reply, I shut the door and slunk away down the stairs like a downtrodden rat.</p><p>Chapter TEN</p><p>I PACED the streets as though walking fast could rid me of my problems, thinking of things I might have said to Debbie to make her accept me. I was sure she felt the same way about me that I felt about her. But my looks were confusing her. I had to find a way to get her to view me as an adult, not a child. What if I told her the truth? I imagined breaking the news to her:</p><p>\"Debbie, prepare yourself for a shock - I'm a vampire.\"</p><p>\"That's nice, dear.\"</p><p>\"You're not upset?\"</p><p>\"Should I be?\"</p><p>\"I drink blood! I creep around in the dead of night, find sleeping humans, and open up their veins!\"</p><p>\"Well... nobody's perfect.\"</p><p>The imaginary conversation brought a fleeting smile to my lips. Actually, I had no idea how Debbie would react. I'd never broken the news to a human before. I didn't know where or how to start, or what a person would say in response. I knew vampires weren't the murderous, emotionless monsters of horror movies and books - but how would I convince others?</p><p>\"Bloody humans!\" I grumbled, kicking a postbox in anger. \"Bloody vampires! We should all be turtles or something!\"</p><p>On that ridiculous thought, I looked around and realized I'd no idea which part of city I was in. I scouted for a familiar street name, so I could chart a course for home. The streets were largely deserted. Now that the mystery killers had stopped or moved on, the soldiers had withdrawn, and although local police still patrolled the streets, the barricades had come down and you could walk unheeded. Even so, the curfew was still in effect, and most people were happy to respect it.</p><p>I relished the dark, quiet streets. Walking alone down narrow, twisting alleys, I could have been winding my way through the tunnels of Vampire Mountain. It was comforting to imagine myself back with Seba Nile, Vanez Blane and the others, no love life, school or fate-fuelled quests to trouble me.</p><p>Thinking about Vampire Mountain set me thinking about Paris Skyle. I'd been so busy with school and Debbie, I hadn't had time to brood on the death of the Prince. I'd miss the old vampire who'd taught me so much. We'd shared laughter as well. As I stepped over a pile of rubbish strewn across the ground of a particularly dark alley, I recalled the time a few years ago when he leant too close to a candle and set his beard on fire. He'd hopped around the Hall of Princes like a clown, shrieking and slapping at the flames until-</p><p>Something struck the back of my head, hard, and I went toppling into the rubbish. I cried out as I fell, my recollections of Paris shattering, then rolled away defensively, clutching my head between my hands. As I rolled, a silver object came crashing down on the ground where my head had been, and sparks flew.</p>","<p>Ignoring my wounded head, I scrambled to my knees and looked for something to defend myself with. The plastic top of a dustbin lay nearby. It wouldn't be much good but it was all I could find. Stooping swiftly, I snatched it up and held it in front of me like a shield, turning to meet the charge of my assailant, who was streaking towards me at a speed no human could have matched.</p><p>Something gold flashed and swung down upon my makeshift shield, cutting the dustbin lid in half. Somebody chuckled, and it was the sound of pure, insane evil.</p><p>For a dreadful moment I thought it was Murlough's ghost, come to wreak revenge. But that was silly. I believed in ghosts - Harkat used to be one, before Mr. Tiny brought him back from the dead - but this guy was far too solid to be a spirit.</p><p>\"I'll cut you to pieces!\" my attacker boasted, circling me warily. There was something familiar about his voice, but try as I might, I couldn't place it.</p><p>I studied his outline as he circled around me. He was wearing dark clothes and his face was masked by a balaclava. The ends of a beard jutted out from underneath it. He was large and chunky - but not as fat as Murlough had been - and I could see two blood-red eyes glinting above his snarling teeth. He had no hands, just two metallic attachments - one gold, the other silver - attached to the ends of his elbows. There were three hooks on each attachment, sharp, curved and deadly.</p><p>The vampaneze - the eyes and speed were the giveaway - struck. He was fast, but I avoided the killer hooks, which dug into the wall behind me and gouged out a sizeable crater when he pulled free. It took less than a second for my attacker to free his hand, but I used that time to strike, kicking him in the chest. But he'd been expecting it and brought his other arm down upon my shin, cruelly knocking my leg aside.</p><p>I yelped as pain shot up the length of my leg. Hopping madly, I threw the two halves of the useless dustbin lid at the vampaneze. He ducked out of the way, laughing. I tried to run - no good. My injured leg wouldn't support me, and after a couple of strides I collapsed to the floor, helpless.</p><p>I whirled over on to my back and stared up at the hook-handed vampaneze as he took his time approaching. He swung his arms back and forth as he got closer, the hooks making horrible screeching noises as they scraped together. \"Going to cut you,\" the vampaneze hissed. \"Slow and painful. I'll start on your fingers. Slice them off, one at a time. Then your hands. Then your toes. Then-\"</p><p>There was a sharp clicking noise, followed by the hiss of parted air. Something shot by the vampaneze's head, only narrowly missing. It struck the wall and embedded itself - a short, thick, steel-tipped arrow. The vampaneze cursed and crouched, hiding in the shadows of the alley.</p><p>Moments ticked by like spiders scuttling up my spine. The vampaneze's angry breath and my gasping sobs filled the air. There was no sight or sound of the person who'd fired the arrow. Shuffling backwards, the vampaneze locked gazes with me and bared his teeth. \"I'll get you later,\" he vowed. \"You'll die slowly, in great agony. I'll cut you. Fingers first. One at a time.\" Then he turned and sprinted. A second arrow was fired after him, but he ducked low and again it missed, burying itself in a large bag of rubbish. The vampaneze exploded out of the end of the alley and vanished quickly into the night.</p><p>There was a lengthy pause. Then footsteps. A man of medium height appeared out of the gloom. He was dressed in black, with a long scarf looped around his neck, and gloves covering his hands. He had grey hair - though he wasn't old - and there was a stern set to his features. He was holding a gun-shaped weapon, out of the end of which jutted a steel-tipped arrow. Another of the arrow-firing guns was slung over his left shoulder.</p><p>I sat up, grunting, and tried to rub some life back into my right leg. \"Thanks,\" I said as the man got closer. He didn't answer, just proceeded to the end of the alley, where he scanned the area beyond for signs of the vampaneze.</p><p>Turning, the grey-haired man came back and stopped a couple of metres away. He was holding the arrow gun in his right hand, but it wasn't pointed harmlessly down at the ground - it was pointing at me.</p><p>\"Mind lowering that?\" I asked, forcing a sheepish smile. \"You just saved my life. Be a shame if that went off by accident and killed me.\"</p><p>He didn't reply immediately. Nor did he lower the gun. There was no warmth in his expression. \"Does it surprise you that I spared your life?\" he asked. As with the vampaneze, there was something familiar about this man's voice, but again I couldn't place it.</p><p>\"I... guess,\" I said weakly, nervously eyeing the arrow gun.</p><p>\"Do you know why I saved you?\"</p><p>I gulped. \"Out of the goodness of your heart?\"</p><p>\"Maybe.\" He took a step closer. The tip of the gun was now aimed directly at my heart. If he fired, he'd create a hole the size of a football in my chest. \"Or maybe I was saving you for myself!\" he hissed.</p><p>\"Who are you?\" I croaked, desperately pressing back against the wall.</p><p>\"You don't recognize me?\"</p><p>I shook my head. I was certain I'd seen his face before, but I couldn't put a name to it.</p><p>The man breathed out through his nose. \"Strange. I never thought you'd forget. Then again, it's been a long time, and the years haven't been as kind to me as they've been to you. Perhaps you'll remember this.\" He held out his left hand. The palm of the glove had been cut away, exposing the flesh beneath. It was an ordinary hand in all respects save one - in the centre, a rough cross had been carved into the flesh.</p><p>As I stared at the cross, pink and tender-looking, the years evaporated and I was back in a cemetery on my first night as a vampire's assistant, facing a boy whose life I'd saved, a boy who was jealous of me, who thought I'd conspired with Mr. Crepsley and betrayed him.</p><p>\"Steve!\" I gasped, staring from the cross to his cold, hard eyes. \"Steve Leopard!\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" he nodded grimly.</p><p>Steve Leopard, my one-time best friend. The angry, mixed-up boy who'd sworn to become a vampire hunter when he grew up, so that he could track me down - and kill me!</p><p>Chapter ELEVEN</p><p>HE WAS close enough for me to lunge at the gun barrel and maybe redirect it. But I couldn't move. I was stunned beyond anything but passive observation. Debbie Hemlock walking into my English class had left me gobsmacked - but Steve Leopard (his real name was Leonard) turning up out of the blue like this was ten times as shocking.</p><p>After a handful of anxious seconds, Steve lowered the arrow gun, then jammed it through a belt behind his back. He extended his hands, took my left arm above the elbow, and hauled me to my feet. I rose obediently, a puppet in his hands.</p>","<p>\"Had you going for a minute, didn't I?\" he said - and smiled.</p><p>\"You're not going to kill me?\" I wheezed.</p><p>\"Hardly!\" He took my right hand and shook it awkwardly. \"Hello, Darren. Good to see you again, old friend.\"</p><p>I stared at our clasped hands, then at his face. Then I threw my arms around him and hugged him for dear life. \"Steve!\" I sobbed into his shoulder.</p><p>\"Stop that,\" he muttered and I could hear the sound of his own voice breaking. \"You'll have me in tears if you keep it up.\" Pushing me away, he wiped around his eyes and grinned.</p><p>I dried my cheeks and beamed. \"It's really you!\"</p><p>\"Of course. You don't think two people could be born this handsome, do you?\"</p><p>\"Modest as ever,\" I noted wryly.</p><p>\"Nothing to be modest about,\" he sniffed, then laughed. \"You able to walk?\"</p><p>\"I think a hobble's the best I can manage,\" I said.</p><p>\"Then lean on me. I don't want to hang around. Hooky might come back with his friends.\"</p><p>\"Hooky? Oh, you mean the vampa-\" I stopped, wondering how much Steve knew about the creatures of the night.</p><p>\"The vampaneze,\" he finished, nodding soberly.</p><p>\"You know about them?\"</p><p>\"Obviously.\"</p><p>\"Is the hook-handed guy the one who's been killing people?\"</p><p>\"Yes. But he isn't alone. We'll discuss it later. Let's get you out of here and cleaned up first.\" Letting me lean on him, Steve led me back the way I'd come, and as we walked I couldn't help wondering if I'd been knocked unconscious in the alley. If not for the pain in my leg - which was all too real - I'd have been seriously tempted to think this was nothing but a wishful dream.</p><p>Steve took me to the fifth floor of a run-down apartment block. Many of the doors we passed along the landing were boarded-over or broken down. \"Nice neighbourhood,\" I commented sarcastically.</p><p>\"It's a condemned building,\" he said. \"A few apartments are occupied - mostly by old folk with nowhere else to go - but the majority are empty. I prefer places like this to boarding houses and hotels. The space and quiet suit my purposes.\"</p><p>Steve stopped at a battered brown door kept shut by an extra thick padlock and chain. Rooting through his pockets, he found a key, unlocked the padlock, removed the chain and pushed the door open. The air inside was stale, but he took no notice as he bundled me inside and closed the door. The darkness within held until he lit a candle. \"No electricity,\" he said. \"The lower apartments are still connected, but it went off up here last week.\"</p><p>He helped me into a cluttered living room and laid me down on a couch that had seen better days - it was threadbare, and wiry springs stuck out through several holes. \"Try not to impale yourself,\" Steve laughed.</p><p>\"Is your interior decorator on strike?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Don't complain,\" Steve scolded me. \"It's a good base to work from. If we had to report back to some swanky hotel, we'd have to explain your leg and why we're covered in filth. As for accounting for these ...\" He shrugged off the pair of arrow guns and laid them down.</p><p>\"Care to tell me what's going on, Steve?\" I asked quietly. \"How you were in that alley and why you're carrying those?\"</p><p>\"Later,\" he said, \"after we've tended to your wounds. And after you've-\" he produced a mobile phone and tossed it to me \"-made a call.\"</p><p>\"Who am I supposed to ring?\" I asked, staring at the phone suspiciously.</p><p>\"Hooky followed you from your friend's house - the dark-skinned lady.\"</p><p>My face whitened. \"He knows where Debbie lives?\" I gasped.</p><p>\"If that's her name - yes. I doubt he'll go after her, but if you don't want to run the risk, my advice is to call and tell her to-\"</p><p>I was hitting buttons before he finished. Debbie's phone rang four times. Five. Six. Seven. I was about to dash to her rescue, regardless of my bad leg, when she picked up and said, \"Hello?\"</p><p>\"It's me.\"</p><p>\"Darren? What are-\"</p><p>\"Debbie - do you trust me?\"</p><p>There was a startled pause. \"Is this a joke?\"</p><p>\"Do you trust me?\" I growled.</p><p>\"Of course,\" she answered, sensing my seriousness.</p><p>\"Then get out now. Throw some gear into a bag and scram. Find a hotel for the weekend. Stay there.\"</p><p>\"Darren, what's going on? Have you lost your-\"</p><p>\"Do you want to die?\" I interrupted.</p><p>A silent beat. Then, quietly, \"No.\"</p><p>\"Then get out.\" I hit the disconnect button and prayed she'd heed my warning. \"Does the vampaneze know where I'm staying?\" I asked, thinking of Harkat.</p><p>\"I doubt it,\" Steve said. \"If he did, he'd have attacked you there. From what I saw, he stumbled upon you earlier tonight by chance. He was casing a crowd, selecting his next victim, when he saw you and picked up your trail. He followed you to your friend's house, waited, trailed after you when you left, and...\"</p><p>I knew the rest.</p><p>Steve fetched a first-aid kit from a shelf behind the couch. He told me to lean forward, then examined the back of my head. \"Is it cut?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Yes, but not badly. It doesn't need stitches. I'll clean it up and apply a dressing.\" With my head seen to, he focused on my leg. It was deeply gashed and the material of my trousers was soaked through with blood. Steve snipped it away with a sharp pair of scissors, exposing the flesh beneath, then swabbed at the wound with cotton wool. When it was clean, he studied it momentarily, then left and came back with a reel of catgut and a needle. \"This'll hurt,\" he said.</p><p>\"It won't be the first time I've been stitched back together,\" I grinned. He went to work on the cut, and did a neat job on it. I'd only have a small scar when it was fully healed. \"You've done this before,\" I noted as he tucked the catgut away.</p><p>\"I took first-aid classes,\" he said. \"Figured they'd come in handy. Never guessed who my first patient would be.\" He asked if I wanted something to drink.</p><p>\"Just some water.\"</p><p>He pulled a bottle of mineral water out of a bag by the sink and filled a couple of glasses. \"Sorry it's not cold. The fridge won't work without electricity.\"</p><p>\"No problem,\" I said, taking a long drink. Then I nodded at the sink. \"Has the water been cut off too?\"</p>","<p>\"No, but you wouldn't want to drink any - fine for washing, but you'd be on a toilet for days if you swallowed.\"</p><p>We smiled at each other over the rims of our glasses.</p><p>\"So,\" I said, \"mind telling me what you've been up to these last fifteen years?\"</p><p>\"You first,\" Steve said.</p><p>\"Nuh-uh. You're the host. It's your place to start.\"</p><p>\"Toss you for it?\" he suggested.</p><p>\"OK.\"</p><p>He produced a coin and told me to call. \"Heads.\"</p><p>He flipped the coin, caught it and slapped it over. When he took his hand away he grimaced. \"I never did have much luck,\" he sighed, then started to talk. It was a long story, and we were down to the bottom of the bottle of water and on to a second candle before he finished.</p><p>Steve hated Mr. Crepsley and me for a long, long time. He'd sit up late into the night, plotting his future, dreaming of the day he'd track us down and stake us through the heart. \"I was crazy with rage,\" he muttered. \"I couldn't think about anything else. In woodwork classes I made stakes. In geography I committed the maps of the world to memory, so I'd know my way around whichever country I traced you to.\"</p><p>He found out everything there was to know about vampires. He'd had a large collection of horror books when I knew him, but he'd doubled, then trebled that in the space of a year. He learnt what climates we favoured, where we preferred to make our homes, how best to kill us. \"I got in contact with people on the Internet,\" he said. \"You'd be surprised how many vampire hunters there are. We exchanged notes, stories, opinions. Most were crackpots, but a few knew what they were talking about.\"</p><p>When he turned sixteen he left school and home, and went out into the world. He supported himself through a series of odd jobs, working in hotels, restaurants and factories. Sometimes he stole, or broke into empty houses and squatted. They were rough, lean, lonely years. He had very few scruples, hardly any friends, and no real interests except learning how to become a killer of vampires.</p><p>\"To begin with, I thought I'd pretend to befriend them,\" he explained. \"I went in search of vampires, acting as if I wanted to become one. Most of what I'd read in books or gleaned through the Internet was rubbish. I decided the best way to rid myself of my enemies was to get to know them.\"</p><p>Of course, when he eventually tracked a few vampires down and worked himself into their good books, he realized we weren't monsters. He discovered our respect for life, that we didn't kill humans when we drank and that we were people of honour. \"It made me take a long, hard look at myself,\" he sighed, his face dark and sad by the light of the candle. \"I saw that I was the monster, like Captain Ahab in Moby Dick, chasing a pair of killer whales - except these whales weren't killers!\"</p><p>Gradually his hatred subsided. He still resented me for going off with Mr. Crepsley, but accepted the fact that I hadn't done it to spite him. When he looked back at the past, he saw that I'd given up my family and home to save his life, and hadn't tricked or plotted against him.</p><p>That's when he dropped his crazy quest. He stopped searching for us, put all thoughts of revenge from his mind, and sat down to work out what he was going to do with the rest of his life. \"I could have gone back,\" he said. \"My mother's still alive. I could have returned home, finished my education, found a normal job, carved out an ordinary life for myself. But the night has a way of claiming those who embrace it. I'd found out the truth about vampires - but also about vampaneze.\"</p><p>Steve couldn't stop thinking about the vampaneze. He thought it was incredible that creatures like that could exist, roaming and killing as they pleased. It angered him. He wanted to put a stop to their murderous ways. \"But I couldn't go to the police,\" he smiled ruefully. \"I'd have had to capture a live vampaneze to prove they existed, but taking a vampaneze alive is almost impossible, as I'm sure you know. Even if they believed me, what could they have done? Vampaneze move in, kill, then move on. By the time I'd convinced the police of the danger they were in, the vampaneze would have vanished, and the danger with him. There was only one thing for it - I had to take them on myself!\"</p><p>Applying the knowledge he'd gathered when studying to be a vampire hunter, Steve set himself the task of tracking down and killing as many vampaneze as he could. It wasn't easy - vampaneze hide their tracks (and the bodies of their victims) expertly, leaving little evidence of their existence - but in time he found people who knew something of their ways, and he built up a picture of vampaneze habits, traits and routes, and eventually stumbled upon one.</p><p>\"Killing him was the hardest thing I'd ever done,\" Steve said grimly. \"I knew he was a killer, and would kill again if I let him go, but as I stood there, studying him while he slept...\" He shivered.</p><p>\"How did you do it?\" I asked quietly. \"A stake?\"</p><p>He nodded bitterly. \"Fool that I was - yes.\"</p><p>\"I don't understand,\" I frowned. \"Isn't a stake the best way to kill a vampaneze, like with vampires?\"</p><p>He stared coldly at me. \"Ever kill anybody with a stake?\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"Don't!\" he snorted. \"Driving it in is simple enough, but blood gushes up into your face, over your arms and chest, and the vampaneze doesn't die straightaway like vampires do in movies. The one I killed lived for the better part of a minute, thrashing and screaming. He crawled out of the coffin and came after me. He was slow, but I slipped on his blood, and before I knew what was happening, he was on top of me.\"</p><p>\"What did you do?\" I gasped.</p><p>\"I punched and kicked him and tried to knock him off. Fortunately he'd lost too much blood and hadn't the strength to kill me. But he died on top of me, his blood drenching me, his face next to mine as he shuddered and sobbed and...\"</p><p>Steve looked away. I didn't press him for further details.</p><p>\"Since then I've learnt to use those.\" He nodded at the arrow guns. \"They're the best there is. An axe is good too - if you have a good aim and the strength to chop a head clean off - but stay away from ordinary guns - they're not reliable where the extra tough bones and muscles of the vampaneze are concerned.\"</p><p>\"I'll bear that in mind,\" I said, grinning sickly, then asked how many vampaneze Steve had killed.</p>","<p>\"Six, though two of those were mad and would have died before long anyway.\"</p><p>I was impressed. \"That's more than most vampires kill.\"</p><p>\"Humans have an advantage over vampires,\" Steve said. \"We can move about and strike by day. In a fair contest, a vampaneze would wipe the floor with me. But if you catch them in the day, while they're sleeping...</p><p>\"Although,\" he added, \"that's changing. The last few I've tracked have been accompanied by humans. I wasn't able to get close enough to kill them. It's the first time I've heard of vampaneze travelling with human assistants.\"</p><p>\"They're called vampets,\" I told him.</p><p>He frowned. \"How do you know? I thought the families of the night had nothing to do with one another.\"</p><p>\"We hadn't until recently,\" I said grimly, then glanced at my watch. Steve's story wasn't complete - he still hadn't explained how he'd wound up here - but it was time I made a move. It was getting late and I didn't want Harkat to worry. \"Will you come to my hotel with me? You can finish telling me about yourself there. Besides, there's someone I'd like you to share your story with.\"</p><p>\"Mr. Crepsley?\" Steve guessed.</p><p>\"No. He's away on... business. This is somebody else.\"</p><p>\"Who?\"</p><p>\"It would take too long to explain. Will you come?\"</p><p>He hesitated a moment, then said he would. But he stopped to grab his arrow guns before we left - I had a feeling Steve didn't even go to the toilet without his weapons!</p><p>Chapter TWELVE</p><p>DURING THE walk to the hotel, I filled Steve in on what I'd been up to. It was a greatly condensed version, but I covered most of the bases, and told him about the War of the Scars and how it started.</p><p>\"The Lord of the Vampaneze,\" he muttered. \"I thought it was strange, how they were organizing.\"</p><p>I asked Steve about my family and friends, but he hadn't been home since he was sixteen, and knew nothing about them.</p><p>At the hotel he clambered on to my back and I scaled the outside wall. The stitches in my leg strained with the effort, but held. I rapped on the window and Harkat quickly appeared and let us in. He stared suspiciously at Steve but said nothing until I'd made the introductions.</p><p>\"Steve Leopard,\" he mused. \"I've heard much... about you.\"</p><p>\"None of it good, I bet,\" Steve laughed, rubbing his hands together - he hadn't taken off his gloves, although he'd loosened his scarf slightly. There was a strong medicinal smell coming from him, which I only noticed now that we were in a warm, normal room.</p><p>\"What's he doing here?\" Harkat asked me, green eyes pinned on Steve. I gave him a quick run-down. Harkat relaxed slightly when he heard that Steve had saved my life, but remained on guard. \"You think it was wise to bring... him here?\"</p><p>\"He's my friend,\" I said shortly. \"He saved my life.\"</p><p>\"But he knows where we are now.\"</p><p>\"So?\" I snapped.</p><p>\"Harkat's right,\" Steve said. \"I'm human. If I fell into the hands of the vampaneze, they could torture the name of this place out of me. You should move on to somewhere new in the morning, and not tell me about it.\"</p><p>\"I don't think that will be necessary,\" I said stiffly, angry with Harkat for not trusting Steve.</p><p>There was an uncomfortable silence. \"Well!\" Steve laughed, breaking it. \"It's rude to ask, but I have to. What on earth are you, Harkat Mulds?\"</p><p>The Little Person grinned at the directness of the question and warmed to Steve a bit. Asking Steve to sit, he told him about himself, how he was a ghost who'd been brought back to life by Mr. Tiny. Steve was astounded. \"I've never heard anything like this before!\" he exclaimed. \"I was interested in the small people in the blue robes when I saw them at the Cirque Du Freak - I sensed there was something weird about them. But with all that's happened since, they'd slipped my mind entirely.\"</p><p>Harkat's revelation - that he'd been a ghost - unnerved Steve. \"Something wrong?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Kind of,\" he muttered. \"I never believed in life after death. When I killed, I thought that was the end of the matter. Knowing that people have souls, that they can survive death and even come back... It's not the most welcome news.\"</p><p>\"Afraid the vampaneze you killed will come after you?\" I smirked.</p><p>\"Something like that.\" Shaking his head, Steve settled down and finished telling the story he'd started earlier that night in his apartment. \"I came here two months ago, when I heard reports of what appeared to be a vampaneze presence. I thought the killer must be a mad vampaneze, since normally only the crazy ones leave bodies where they can be found. But what I discovered was far more disturbing.\"</p><p>Steve was a highly resourceful investigator. He'd managed to examine three of the victims, and found minor differences in the ways they'd been killed. \"Vampaneze - even the crazy ones - have highly developed drinking patterns. No two kill and drain a victim exactly alike, and no vampaneze varies his method. There had to be more than one of them at work.\"</p><p>And since mad vampaneze were by their nature loners, Steve concluded that the killers must be sane.</p><p>\"But it doesn't make sense,\" he sighed. \"Sane vampaneze shouldn't leave bodies where they can be found. As far as I can figure, they're setting a trap for someone, though I've no idea who.\"</p><p>I glanced questioningly at Harkat. He hesitated, then nodded. \"Tell him,\" he said, and I told Steve about the fake forms which had been sent to Mahler's.</p><p>\"They're after you?\" Steve asked incredulously.</p><p>\"Possibly,\" I said. \"Or Mr. Crepsley. But we're not entirely sure. Somebody else might be behind it, someone who wants to pit us against the vampaneze.\"</p><p>Steve thought about that in silence.</p><p>\"You still haven't told us how you were... there to save Darren tonight,\" Harkat said, interrupting Steve's reverie.</p><p>Steve shrugged. \"Luck. I've been turning this city upside-down, searching for vampaneze. The killers aren't in any of their usual hiding places - abandoned factories or buildings, crypts, old theatres. Eight nights ago, I spotted a large man with hooks for hands emerging from an underground tunnel.\"</p><p>\"That's the guy who attacked me,\" I told Harkat. \"He has three hooks on either arm. One hand's made of gold, the other of silver.\"</p>","<p>\"I've been following him every night since,\" Steve continued. \"It isn't easy for a human to trail a vampaneze - their senses are much more acute - but I've had plenty of practice. Sometimes I lose him, but I always pick him up again exiting the tunnels at dusk.\"</p><p>\"He comes out the same way every night?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Of course not,\" Steve snorted. \"Even a crazy vampaneze wouldn't do that.\"</p><p>\"Then how do you find him?\"</p><p>\"By wiring manhole covers.\" Steve beamed proudly. \"Vampaneze won't use the same exit night after night, but they tend to stick to a strictly defined area when they set up base. I wired every manhole cover within a two hundred metre radius - I've extended that to half a kilometre since. Whenever one of them opens, a light flashes on a kit I have, and it's a simple matter to track the vampaneze down.</p><p>\"At least, it was.\" He paused unhappily. \"After tonight, he'll probably move on to somewhere new. He won't know how much I know about him, but he'll expect the worst. I don't think he'll use those tunnels again.\"</p><p>\"Did you know it was Darren you were saving?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>Steve nodded seriously. \"I wouldn't have come to his rescue otherwise.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I frowned.</p><p>\"I could have taken Hooky out ages ago,\" Steve said, \"but I knew he wasn't working alone. I wanted to track down his companions. I've been exploring the tunnels by day, hoping to trail him to his base. By interfering tonight, I've blown that chance. I wouldn't have done that for anyone but you.\"</p><p>\"If he'd attacked an ordinary human, you'd have let him kill?\" I gasped.</p><p>\"Yes.\" Steve's eyes were hard. \"If sacrificing one person means saving many more, I will. If I hadn't caught a glimpse of your face as you left your lady friend's, I'd have let Hooky kill you.\"</p><p>That was a harsh way of looking at the world, but it was a way I understood. Vampires knew the needs of the group had to be put before those of the individual. It surprised me that Steve was able to think that way - most humans can't - but I suppose you have to learn to be ruthless if you dedicate yourself to the hunting and killing of ruthless creatures.</p><p>\"That's about the bones of it,\" Steve said, pulling his dark overcoat a notch tighter around his shoulders, suppressing a shiver. \"There's plenty I haven't mentioned, but I've covered most of the major stuff.\"</p><p>\"Are you cold?\" Harkat asked, noting Steve's shivers. \"I can turn up the heat.\"</p><p>\"Wouldn't do any good,\" Steve said. \"I picked up some kind of germ when Mr. Crepsley tested me all those years ago. I catch colds simply by looking at someone with a runny nose.\" He plucked at the scarf around his throat, then wiggled his gloved fingers. \"That's why I wrap up so much. If I don't, I wind up confined to bed for days on ends, coughing and spluttering.\"</p><p>\"Is that why you smell?\" I asked.</p><p>Steve laughed. \"Yeah. It's a special herbal mix. I rub it in all over before I get dressed every morning. It works wonders. The only drawback is the stench. I have to be careful to keep downwind of the vampaneze when I'm tracking them - one whiff of this and they'd have me pegged.\"</p><p>We discussed the past some more - Steve wanted to know what life in the Cirque Du Freak had been like; I wanted to know where he'd been and what he'd got up to when he wasn't hunting - then talk returned to the present and what we were going to do about the vampaneze.</p><p>\"If Hooky was acting alone,\" Steve said, \"my attack would have driven him off. The vampaneze don't take chances when they're alone. If they think they've been discovered, they flee. But since he's part of a gang, I doubt he'll run.\"</p><p>\"I agree,\" I said. \"They've gone to too much trouble preparing this trap to walk away the first time something goes wrong.\"</p><p>\"Do you think the vampaneze will know it was... you who saved Darren?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"I don't see how,\" Steve replied. \"They know nothing about me. They'll probably think it was you or Mr. Crepsley. I was careful not to reveal myself to Hooky.\"</p><p>\"Then we might still get the better of them,\" Harkat said. \"We haven't gone hunting for them since... Mr. Crepsley left. It would be too dangerous, just the... two of us.\"</p><p>\"But if you had me to go with you,\" Steve said, reading Harkat's thoughts, \"it would be different. I'm accustomed to vampaneze hunts. I know where to look and how to track them.\"</p><p>\"And with us to back you up,\" I added, \"you could work faster than normal and cover more ground.\"</p><p>We gazed silently around at one another.</p><p>\"You'd be taking a big risk, getting involved... with us,\" Harkat warned him. \"Whoever set us up knows all... about us. You might tip them off to your presence by... pitching in with us.\"</p><p>\"It'd be risky for you too,\" Steve countered. \"You're safe up here. Underground, it's their turf, and if we go down, we're inviting an attack. Remember - though vampaneze usually sleep by day, they don't need to when they're sheltered from the sun. They could be awake and waiting.\"</p><p>We thought about it some more. Then I stretched forth my right hand and held it out in front of me, palm downwards. \"I'm up for it if you are,\" I said.</p><p>Steve immediately laid his left hand - the one with the scarred palm - on top of mine and said, \"I've nothing to lose. I'm with you.\"</p><p>Harkat was slower to react. \"I wish Mr. Crepsley was here,\" he mumbled.</p><p>\"Me too,\" I said. \"But he's not. And the longer we wait for him, the more time the vampaneze have to plan an attack. If Steve's right, and they panic and switch base. it'll take them a while to settle. They'll be vulnerable. This could be our best chance to strike.\"</p><p>Harkat sighed unhappily. \"It could also be our best chance to walk... straight into a trap. But,\" he added, laying a large grey hand on top of ours, \"the rewards justify the risks. If we can find and kill them, we'll save... many lives. I'm with you.\"</p><p>Smiling at Harkat, I proposed a vow. \"To the death?\" I suggested.</p><p>\"To the death,\" Steve agreed.</p><p>\"To the death,\" Harkat nodded, then added pointedly, \"but not, I hope, ours!\"</p>","<p>Chapter THIRTEEN</p><p>WE SPENT Saturday and Sunday exploring the tunnels. Harkat and Steve carried arrow guns. They were simple to use - load an arrow, point and fire. Deadly up to a range of twenty metres. As a vampire, I'd sworn not to use such weapons, so I had to make do with my usual short sword and knives.</p><p>We started with the area where Steve had first spotted 'Hooky', in the hope of finding some trace of him or his companions. We took the tunnels one at a time, examining the walls for marks of vampaneze nails or hooks, listening carefully for sounds of life, keeping within sight of each other. We moved swiftly at first - Steve knew these tunnels - but when our search extended to new, unfamiliar sections, we advanced more cautiously.</p><p>We found nothing.</p><p>That night, after a long wash and simple meal together, we talked some more. Steve hadn't changed much. He was as lively and funny as ever, although he'd sometimes get a faraway look in his eyes and fall silent, perhaps thinking about the vampaneze he'd killed or the path in life he'd chosen. He got nervous whenever talk swung round to Mr. Crepsley. Steve had never forgotten the vampire's reason for rejecting him - Mr. Crepsley said Steve had bad blood and was evil - and didn't think the vampire would be glad to see him.</p><p>\"I don't know why he thought I was evil,\" Steve grumbled. \"I was wild as a kid, sure, but never evil - was I, Darren?\"</p><p>\"Of course not,\" I said.</p><p>\"Maybe he mistook determination for evil,\" Steve mused. \"When I believe in a cause, I'll commit to it wholeheartedly. Like my quest to kill vampaneze. Most humans couldn't kill another living being, even a killer. They'd rather turn them over to the law. But I'll go on killing vampaneze until I die. Maybe Mr. Crepsley saw my ability to kill and confused it with a desire to kill.\"</p><p>We had lots of dark conversations like that, talking about the human soul and the nature of good and evil. Steve had devoted many long hours to Mr. Crepsley's cruel judgement. He was almost obsessed with it. \"I can't wait to prove him wrong,\" he smiled. \"When he learns I'm on his side, helping the vampires in spite of his rejecting me... That's something I'm looking forward to.\"</p><p>When the weekend drew to a close, I had a decision to make regarding school. I didn't want to bother with Mahler's - it seemed a waste of time - but there was Debbie and Mr. Blaws to consider. If I dropped out suddenly, without a reason, the inspector would come looking for me. Steve said this wasn't a problem, that we could switch to another hotel, but I didn't want to leave until Mr. Crepsley returned. The Debbie situation was even more complicated. The vampaneze now knew she was connected to me, and where she lived. Somehow I had to convince her to move to a new apartment - but how? What sort of a story could I concoct to persuade her to leave home?</p><p>I decided to go to school that Monday morning, mostly to sort things out with Debbie. With my other teachers, I'd pretend I was coming down with a virus, so they wouldn't suspect anything was amiss when I didn't turn up the next day. I didn't think Mr. Blaws would be sent to investigate before the weekend - missing three or four days was hardly unusual - and by the time he did, Mr. Crepsley would have hopefully returned. When he was back, we could sit down and establish a definite plan..</p><p>Steve and Harkat were going to continue hunting for the vampaneze when I was at school, but agreed to be careful, and promised not to engage them by themselves if they found any.</p><p>At Mahler's, I looked for Debbie before classes began. I was going to tell her that an enemy from my past had found out I was seeing her, and I feared he planned to hurt her, to get at me. I'd say he didn't know where she worked, just where she lived, so if she found somewhere new for a few weeks and didn't go back to her old apartment, she'd be fine.</p><p>It was a weak story, but I could think of nothing better. I'd plead with her if I had to, and do all in my power to persuade her to heed my warning. If that failed, I'd have to consider kidnapping her and locking her up to protect her.</p><p>But there was no sign of Debbie at school. I went to the staffroom during the break, but she hadn't turned up for work and nobody knew where she was. Mr. Chivers was with the teachers and he was furious. He couldn't stand it when people - teachers or students - didn't call in before going absent.</p><p>I returned to class with a sinking feeling in my gut. I wished I'd asked Debbie to contact me with her new address, but hadn't thought of that when I'd told her to move. Now there was no way for me to check on her.</p><p>The two hours of classes and first forty minutes of lunch were some of the most miserable moments of my life. I wanted to flee the school and dash round to Debbie's old apartment, to see if there was any sign of her there. But I realized that it would be better not to act at all than to act in panic. It was tearing me apart, but it would be for the best if I waited for my head to clear before I went investigating.</p><p>Then, at ten to two, something wonderful happened - Debbie arrived! I was moping about in the computer room - Richard had sensed my dark mood and left me alone - when I saw her pulling up outside the back of the school in a car accompanied by two men and a woman - all three dressed in police uniforms! Getting out, she entered the building with the woman and one of the men.</p><p>Hurrying, I caught up with her on her way to Mr. Chivers' office. \"Miss Hemlock!\" I shouted, alarming the policeman, who turned quickly, hand going for a weapon on his belt. He stopped when he saw my school uniform and relaxed. I raised a shaking hand. \"Could I talk to you for a minute, Miss?\"</p><p>Debbie asked the officers if she could have a few words with me. They nodded, but kept a close watch on us. \"What's going on?\" I whispered.</p><p>\"You don't know?\" She'd been crying and her face was a mess. I shook my head. \"Why did you tell me to leave?\" she asked, and there was surprising bitterness in her voice.</p><p>\"It's complicated.\"</p><p>\"Did you know what was going to happen? If you did, I'll hate you forever!\"</p><p>\"Debbie, I don't know what you're talking about. Honestly.\"</p><p>She studied my face for a hint of a lie. Finding none, her expression softened. \"You'll hear about it on the news soon,\" she muttered, \"so I guess it doesn't matter if I break it to you now, but don't tell anyone else.\" She took a deep breath. \"I left on Friday when you told me. Booked into a hotel, even though I thought you were crazy.\"</p>","<p>She paused. \"And?\" I prompted her.</p><p>\"Somebody attacked the people in the apartments next to mine,\" she said. \"Mr. and Mrs Andrews, and Mr. Hugon. You never met them, did you?\"</p><p>\"I saw Mrs Andrews once.\" I licked my lips nervously. \"Were they killed?\" Debbie nodded. Fresh tears sprung to her eyes. \"And drained of blood?\" I croaked, dreading the answer.</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>I looked away, ashamed. I never thought the vampaneze would go after Debbie's neighbours. I'd had only her welfare in mind, not anybody else's. I should have staked out her building, anticipating the worst. Three people were dead because I hadn't.</p><p>\"When did it happen?\" I asked sickly.</p><p>\"Late Saturday night or early Sunday morning. The bodies were discovered yesterday afternoon, but the police didn't track me down until today. They've kept it quiet, but I think the news is breaking. There were news teams swarming around the building when I passed on my way over here.\"</p><p>\"Why did the police want to track you down?\" I asked.</p><p>She glared at me. \"If the people either side of the apartment where you lived were killed, and you were nowhere to be found, don't you think the police would look for you too?\" she snapped.</p><p>\"Sorry. Dumb question. I wasn't thinking straight.\"</p><p>Lowering her head, she asked very quietly, \"Do you know who did it?\"</p><p>I hesitated before replying. \"Yes and no. I don't know their names, but I know what they are and why they did it.\"</p><p>\"You must tell the police,\" she said.</p><p>\"It wouldn't help. This is beyond them.\"</p><p>Looking at me through her tears, she said, \"I'll be released later this evening. They've taken my statement, but they want to run me through it a few more times. When they release me, I'm coming to put some hard questions to you. If I'm not happy with your answers, I'll turn you over to them.\"</p><p>\"Thank-\" She swivelled sharply and stormed off, joining the police officers and proceeding on to Mr. Chivers' office \"-you,\" I finished to myself, then slowly headed back for class. The bell rang, signalling the end of lunch - but to me it sounded like a death knell.</p><p>Chapter FOURTEEN</p><p>THE TIME had come to fill Debbie in on the truth, but Steve and Harkat weren't keen on the idea. \"What if she informs the police?\" Steve screeched.</p><p>\"It's dangerous,\" Harkat warned. \"Humans are unpredictable at... the best of times. You can't know how she'll act or what... she'll do.\"</p><p>\"I don't care,\" I said stubbornly. \"The vampaneze aren't toying with us any longer. They know we know about them. They went to kill Debbie. When they couldn't find her, they slaughtered the people living next door. The stakes have risen. We're in deep now. Debbie has to be told how serious this is.\"</p><p>\"And if she betrays us to the police?\" Steve asked quietly.</p><p>\"It's a risk we have to take,\" I sniffed.</p><p>\"A risk you have to take,\" Steve said pointedly.</p><p>\"I thought we were in this together,\" I sighed. \"If I was wrong, leave. I won't stop you.\"</p><p>Steve fidgeted in his chair and traced the cross on his bare left palm with the gloved fingers of his right hand. He did that often, like Mr. Crepsley stroking his scar when he was thinking. \"There's no need to snap,\" Steve said sullenly. \"I'm with you to the end, like I vowed. But you're making a decision that affects all of us. That isn't right. We should vote on this.\"</p><p>I shook my head. \"No votes. I can't sacrifice Debbie, any more than you could let Hooky kill me in the alley. I know I'm putting Debbie before our mission, but I can't help that.\"</p><p>\"You feel that strongly about her?\" Steve asked.</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"Then I won't argue any more. Tell her the truth.\"</p><p>\"Thanks.\" I looked to Harkat for his approval.</p><p>The Little Person dropped his gaze. \"This is wrong. I can't stop you, so I won't try, but... I don't approve. The group should always come before the... individual.\" Pulling his mask - the one he needed to filter out the air, which was poisonous to him - up around his mouth, he turned his back on us and brooded in sullen silence.</p><p>Debbie turned up shortly before seven. She'd showered and changed clothes - the police had fetched some of her personal items from her apartment - but still looked terrible. \"There's a police officer in the lobby,\" she said as she entered. \"They asked if I wanted a personal guard and I said I did. He thinks I came up here to tutor you. I gave him your name. If you object to that - tough!\"</p><p>\"Nice to see you too,\" I smiled, holding out my hands to take her coat. She ignored me and walked into the apartment, stopping short when she caught sight of Steve and Harkat (who was facing away from her).</p><p>\"You didn't say we'd have company,\" she said stiffly.</p><p>\"They have to be here,\" I replied. \"They're part of what I have to tell you.\"</p><p>\"Who are they?\" she asked.</p><p>\"This is Steve Leopard.\" Steve took a quick bow. \"And that's Harkat Mulds.\"</p><p>For a moment I didn't think Harkat was going to face her. Then he slowly turned around. \"Oh, my lord!\" Debbie gasped, shocked by his grey, scarred, unnatural features.</p><p>\"Guess you don't get many like... me in school,\" Harkat smiled nervously.</p><p>\"Is...\" Debbie licked her lips. \"Is he from that institute you told me about? Where you and Evra Von lived?\"</p><p>\"There is no institute. That was a lie.\"</p><p>She eyed me coldly. \"What else have you lied about?\"</p><p>\"Everything, more or less,\" I grinned guiltily. \"But the lies stop here. Tonight I'll tell you the truth. By the end you'll either think I'm crazy or wish I'd never told you, but you have to hear me out - your life depends on it.\"</p><p>\"Is it a long story?\" she asked.</p><p>\"One of the longest you'll ever hear,\" Steve answered with a laugh.</p><p>\"Then I'd better take a pew,\" she said. She chose a chair, shrugged off her coat, laid it across her lap, and nodded curtly to let me know I could begin.</p><p>I started with the Cirque Du Freak and Madam Octa, and took it from there. I quickly covered my years as Mr. Crepsley's assistant and my time in Vampire Mountain. I told her about Harkat and the Lord of the Vampaneze. Then I explained why we'd come here, how fake forms had been submitted to Mahler's, how I'd run into Steve and what role he played in this. I finished with the events of the weekend.</p>","<p>There was a long pause at the end.</p><p>\"It's insane,\" Debbie finally said. \"You can't be serious.\"</p><p>\"He is,\" Steve chuckled.</p><p>\"Vampires... ghosts... vampaneze... It's ludicrous.\"</p><p>\"It's true,\" I said softly. \"I can prove it.\" I raised my fingers to show her the scars on my fingertips.</p><p>\"Scars don't prove anything,\" she sneered.</p><p>I walked to the window. \"Go to the door and face me,\" I said. Debbie didn't respond. I could see the doubt in her eyes. \"Go on,\" I said. \"I won't hurt you.\" Holding her coat in front of her, she went to the door and stood opposite me. \"Keep your eyes open,\" I said. \"Don't even blink if you can help it.\"</p><p>\"What are you going to do?\" she asked.</p><p>\"You'll see - or, rather, you won't.\"</p><p>When she was watching carefully, I tensed the muscles in my legs, then dashed forward, drawing up just in front of her. I moved as quickly as I could, quicker than a human eye could follow. To Debbie it must have seemed that I simply disappeared and reappeared before her. Her eyes shot wide and she leant against the door. Turning, I darted back, again faster than she could follow, stopping by the window.</p><p>\"Ta-da!\" Steve said, clapping dryly.</p><p>\"How did you do that?\" Debbie asked, voice trembling. \"You just... you were there... then you were here... then...\" \"I can move at tremendously fast speeds. I'm strong, too - I could put a fist through any of these walls and not tear the skin on my knuckles. I can leap higher and further than any human. Hold my breath for longer. Live for centuries.\" I shrugged. \"I'm a half-vampire.\"</p><p>\"But it isn't possible! Vampires don't...\" Debbie took a few steps towards me, then stopped. She was torn between wanting to disbelieve me and knowing in her heart that I was telling the truth.</p><p>\"I can spend all night proving it to you,\" I said. \"And you can spend all night pretending there's some other logical explanation. The truth's the truth, Debbie. Accept it or don't - it's your call.\"</p><p>\"I don't... I can't...\" She studied my eyes for a long, searching moment. Then she nodded and sank back into her chair. \"I believe you,\" she moaned. \"Yesterday I wouldn't have, but I saw photos of the Andrews and Mr. Hugon after they'd been killed. I don't think anyone human could have done that.\"</p><p>\"You see now why I had to tell you?\" I asked. \"We don't know why the vampaneze lured us here or why they're playing with us, but their plan is surely to kill us. The attack on your neighbours was only the start of the bloodshed. They won't stop with that. You'll be next if they find you.\"</p><p>\"But why?\" she asked weakly. \"If it's you and this Mr. Crepsley they want, why come after me?\"</p><p>\"I don't know. It doesn't make sense. That's what's so frightening.\"</p><p>\"What are you doing to stop them?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Tracking them by day. Hopefully we'll find them. If we do, we'll fight. With luck, we'll win.\"</p><p>\"You've got to tell the police,\" she insisted. \"And the army. They can-\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said firmly. \"The vampaneze are our concern. We'll deal with them.\"</p><p>\"How can you say that when it's humans they're killing?\" She was angry now. \"The police have struggled to find the killers because they don't know anything about them. If you'd told them what they should be looking for they might have put an end to these creatures months ago.</p><p>\"It doesn't work that way,\" I said. \"It can't.\"</p><p>\"It can!\" she snapped. \"And it will! I'm going to tell the officer in the lobby about this. We'll see what-\"</p><p>\"How will you convince him?\" Steve interrupted.</p><p>\"I'll...\" She drew up short.</p><p>\"He wouldn't believe you,\" Steve pressed. \"He'd think you were mad. He'd call a doctor and they'd take you away to-\" he grinned \" - cure you.\"</p><p>\"I could take Darren with me,\" she said unconvincingly. He-\"</p><p>\"- would smile sweetly and ask the kind policeman why his teacher was acting so strangely,\" Steve chortled.</p><p>\"You're wrong,\" Debbie said shakily. \"I could convince people.\"</p><p>\"Then go ahead,\" Steve smirked. \"You know where the door is. Best of luck. Send us a postcard to let us know how you got on.\"</p><p>\"I don't like you,\" Debbie snarled. \"You're cocky and arrogant.\"</p><p>\"You don't have to like me,\" Steve retorted. \"This isn't a popularity contest. It's a matter of life and death. I've studied the vampaneze and killed six of them. Darren and Harkat have fought and killed them too. We know what we have to do to put a stop to them. Do you honestly think you have the right to stand there and tell us our business? You hadn't even heard of the vampaneze until a few hours ago!\"</p><p>Debbie opened her mouth to argue, then closed it. \"You're right,\" she admitted sullenly. \"You've risked your lives for the sake of others, and you know more about this than me. I shouldn't be lecturing you. I guess it's the teacher in me.\" She managed a very feeble smile.</p><p>\"Then you trust us to deal with it?\" I asked. \"You'll find a new apartment, maybe move out of the city for a few weeks, until it's over?\"</p><p>\"I trust you,\" she said, \"but if you think I'm running away, you're deluding yourself. I'm staying to fight.\"</p><p>\"What are you talking about?\" I frowned.</p><p>\"I'll help you find and kill the vampaneze.\"</p><p>I stared at her, astonished by the simple way she'd put it, as though we were in search of a lost puppy. \"Debbie!\" I gasped. \"Haven't you been listening? These are creatures that can move at super-fast speeds and flick you into the middle of next week with a snap of a finger. What can you - an ordinary human - hope to accomplish?\"</p><p>\"I can explore the tunnels with you,\" she said, \"provide an extra pair of legs, eyes, ears. With me we can split into pairs and cover twice the ground.\"</p><p>\"You couldn't keep up.\" I protested. \"We move too fast.\"</p><p>\"Through dark tunnels, with the threat of the vampaneze ever present?\" She smiled. \"I doubt it.\"</p>","<p>\"OK,\" I agreed, \"you could probably match us for pace, but not endurance. We go all day, hour after hour, without pause. You'd tire and fall behind.\"</p><p>\"Steve keeps up,\" she noted.</p><p>\"Steve's trained himself to track them. Besides,\" I added, \"Steve doesn't have to report to school every day.\"</p><p>\"Neither do I,\" she said. \"I'm on compassionate leave. They don't expect me back' until the start of next week at the earliest.\"</p><p>\"Debbie... you... it's...\" I sputtered, then turned appealingly to Steve. \"Tell her she's out of her mind,\" I pleaded.</p><p>\"Actually, I think it's a good idea,\" he said.</p><p>\"What? I roared.</p><p>\"We could do with another pair of legs down there. If she has the guts for it, I say we give her a go.\"</p><p>\"And if we run into the vampaneze?\" I challenged him. \"Do you see Debbie going face to face with Hooky or his pals?\"</p><p>\"I do, as a matter of fact,\" he smiled. \"From what I've seen, she's got a spine of steel.\"</p><p>\"Thank you,\" Debbie said.</p><p>\"Don't mention it,\" he laughed, then grew serious. \"I can kit her out with an arrow gun. In a scrape we might be glad of an extra body. At least she'd give the vampaneze another target to worry about.\"</p><p>\"I won't stand for it,\" I growled. \"Harkat - tell them.\"</p><p>The Little Persons green eyes were thoughtful. \"Tell them what, Darren?\"</p><p>\"That it's madness! Lunacy! Stupidity!\"</p><p>\"Is it?\" he asked quietly. \"If Debbie was any other person, would you be so... quick to turn down her offer? The odds are against us. We need allies if we are to triumph.\"</p><p>\"But-\" I began.</p><p>\"You got her into this,\" Harkat interrupted. \"I told you not to. You ignored me. You can't control people once... you involve them. She knows the danger and she... accepts it. What excuse have you to reject her offer... other than you're fond of her and... don't want to see her harmed?\"</p><p>Put like that, there was nothing I could say. \"Very well,\" I sighed. \"I don't like this, but if you want to pitch in, I guess we have to let you.\"</p><p>\"He's so gallant, isn't he?\" Steve observed.</p><p>\"He certainly knows how to make a girl feel welcome,\" Debbie grinned, then dropped her coat and leant forward. \"Now,\" she said, \"let's quit with the time-wasting and get down to business. I want to know everything there is to know about these monsters. What do they look like? Describe their smell. What sort of tracks do they leave? Where do-\"</p><p>\"Quiet!\" I snapped, cutting her short.</p><p>She stared at me, offended. \"What did I-\"</p><p>\"Hush,\" I said, quieter this time, laying a finger to my lips. I advanced to the door and pressed my ear against it.</p><p>\"Trouble?\" Harkat asked, stepping up beside me.</p><p>\"I heard soft footsteps in the hallway a minute ago - but no door has opened.\"</p><p>We retreated, communicating with our eyes. Harkat found his axe, then went to check on the window.</p><p>\"What's happening?\" Debbie asked. I could hear the fast, hard beat of her heart.</p><p>\"Maybe nothing - maybe an attack.\"</p><p>\"Vampaneze?\" Steve asked grimly.</p><p>\"I don't know. It could just be an inquisitive maid. But somebody's out there. Maybe they've been eavesdropping, maybe they haven't. Best not to take chances.\"</p><p>Steve swung his arrow gun around and slid an arrow into it.</p><p>\"Anyone outside?\" I asked Harkat.</p><p>\"No. I think the way's clear if we have to make a... break for it.\"</p><p>I drew my sword and tested the blade while considering our next move. If we left now, it would be safer - especially for Debbie - but once you start running, it's hard to stop.</p><p>\"Up for a scrap?\" I asked Steve.</p><p>He let out an uneven breath. \"I've never fought a vampaneze on its feet,\" he said. \"I've always struck by day, while they were sleeping. I don't know how much use I'd be.\"</p><p>\"Harkat?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I think you and I should go see... what's going on,\" he said. \"Steve and Debbie can wait by the window. If they hear sounds of fighting, they... should leave.\"</p><p>\"How?\" I asked. \"There's no fire escape and they can't scale walls.\"</p><p>\"No problem,\" Steve said. Reaching inside his jacket, he unwrapped a thin rope from around his waist. \"I always come prepared,\" he winked.</p><p>\"Will that hold two of you?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>Steve nodded and tied one end of the rope to a radiator. Going to the window, he swung it open and threw the other end of the rope down. \"Over here,\" he said to Debbie, and she went to him without objecting. He got her to climb on to the window sill and back out over it, holding on to the rope, so she was ready to descend in a hurry. \"You two do what you have to,\" Steve said, covering the door with his arrow gun. \"We'll get out if things look bad.\"</p><p>I checked with Harkat, then tiptoed to the door and took hold of the handle. \"I'll go first,\" I said, \"and drop low. You come straight after me. If you see anyone who looks like they don't belong - scalp them. We'll stop to ask for their credentials later.\"</p><p>I opened the door and dived into the hall, not bothering with a count. Harkat stepped out after me, arrow gun raised. Nobody to my left. I spun right - no one there either. I paused, ears cocked.</p><p>Long, tense moments passed. We didn't move. The silence gnawed at our nerves but we ignored it and concentrated - when you're fighting vampaneze, a second of distraction is all they need.</p><p>Then someone coughed overhead.</p><p>Dropping to the floor, I twisted on to my back and brought my sword upright, while Harkat swung his arrow gun up.</p><p>The figure clinging to the ceiling dropped before Harkat could fire, knocked him across the hallway, then kicked my sword from my hands. I scrambled after it, then stopped at a familiar chuckle. \"Game, set and match to me, I think.\"</p><p>Turning, I was greeted with the sight of a chunky man dressed in purple animal skins, with bare feet and dyed green hair. It was my fellow Vampire Prince - Vancha March!</p><p>\"Vancha!\" I gasped, as he grabbed me by the scruff of the neck and helped me to my feet. Harkat had risen by himself and was rubbing the back of his head, where Vancha had struck him.</p>","<p>\"Darren,\" Vancha said. \"Harkat.\" He wagged a finger at us. \"You should always check the shadows overhead when scanning for danger. If I'd meant to harm you, the two of you would be dead now.\"</p><p>\"When did you get back?\" I cried excitedly. \"Why did you sneak up on us? Where's Mr. Crepsley?\"</p><p>\"Larten's on the roof. We got back about fifteen minutes ago. We heard unfamiliar voices in the room, which is why we moved cautiously. Who's in there with you?\"</p><p>\"Come in and I'll introduce you,\" I grinned, then led him into the room. I told Steve and Debbie that we were safe, and went to the window to call down a wary, wind-bitten, very welcome Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>Chapter FIFTEEN</p><p>MR. CREPSLEY was every bit as suspicious of Steve as Steve had predicted. Even after I'd told him about the attack and Steve saving my life, he regarded the human with ill-concealed contempt and remained at a distance. \"Blood does not change,\" he growled. \"When I tested Steve Leonard's blood, it was the taste of pure evil. Time cannot have diluted that.\"</p><p>\"I'm not evil,\" Steve growled in return. \"You're the cruel one, making horrible, unfounded accusations. Do you realize how low an opinion I had of myself after you'd dismissed me as a monster? Your ugly rejection almost drove me to evil!\"</p><p>\"It would not, I think, have been a lengthy drive,\" Mr. Crepsley said smoothly.</p><p>\"You could have been wrong, Larten,\" Vancha said. The Prince was lying on the couch, feet propped on the TV set, which he'd dragged closer. His skin wasn't as red as it had been when I last saw him (Vancha was convinced he could train himself to survive sunlight, and often strolled about by day for an hour or so, allowing himself to be badly burnt, building up his body's defences). I guessed he must have spent the past few months walled-up inside Vampire Mountain.</p><p>\"I was not wrong,\" Mr. Crepsley insisted. \"I know the taste of evil.\"</p><p>\"I wouldn't bet on that,\" Vancha said, scratching an armpit. A bug fell out and landed on the floor. He guided it away with his right foot. \"Blood's not as easy to divine as certain vampires think. I've found traces of 'evil' blood in several people over the decades, and kept tabs on them. Three went bad, so I killed them. The others led normal lives.\"</p><p>\"Not all who are born evil commit evil,\" Mr. Crepsley said, \"but I do not believe in taking chances. I cannot trust him.\"</p><p>\"That's stupid,\" I snapped. \"You have to judge people by what they do, not by what you believe they might do. Steve's my friend. I'll vouch for him.\"</p><p>\"Me too,\" Harkat said. \"I was cautious at first, but I'm confident now that... he's on our side. It's not just Darren he saved - he also warned him... to ring Debbie and tell her to get out. She'd be dead otherwise.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley shook his head stubbornly. \"I say we should test his blood again. Vancha can do it. He will see that I am telling the truth.\"</p><p>\"There's no point,\" Vancha said. \"If you say there are traces of evil in his blood, I'm sure there are. But people can overcome their natural defects. I know nothing of this man, but I know Darren and Harkat, and I place more faith in their judgement than in the quality of Steve's blood.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley muttered something under his breath, but he knew he was outnumbered. \"Very well,\" he said mechanically. \"I will speak no more of it. But I will keep a very close watch on you,\" he warned Steve.</p><p>\"Watch away,\" Steve sniffed in reply.</p><p>To clear the air, I asked Vancha why he'd been absent so long. He said he'd reported to Mika Ver Leth and Paris Skyle and told them about the Vampaneze Lord. He would have left immediately, but he saw how close to death Paris was, and decided to see out the Prince's last few months beside him.</p><p>\"He died well,\" Vancha said. \"When he knew he was no longer able to play his part, he slipped away in secret. We found his body a few nights later, locked in a death embrace with a bear.\"</p><p>\"That's horrible!\" Debbie gasped, and everybody in the room smiled at her typical human reaction.</p><p>\"Trust me,\" I told her, \"there's no worse way for a vampire to die than in a bed, peacefully. Paris had more than eight hundred years under his belt. I doubt he left this world with any complaints.\"</p><p>\"Still...\" she said, troubled.</p><p>\"That's the vampire way,\" Vancha said, leaning across to give her hand a comforting squeeze. \"I'll take you aside some night and explain it to you,\" he added, leaving his hand on hers a few seconds longer than necessary.</p><p>If Mr. Crepsley was going to keep a close eye on Steve, I was going to keep an even closer one on Vancha! I could see that he fancied Debbie. I didn't think shed be attracted to the ill-mannered, mud-stained, smelly Prince - but I wouldn't leave him alone with her to find out!</p><p>\"Any news of the Vampaneze Lord or Gannen Harst?\" I asked, to distract him.</p><p>\"No,\" he said. \"I told the Generals that Gannen was my brother and gave them a full description of him, but none had seen him recently.\"</p><p>\"What of events here?\" Mr. Crepsley asked. \"Has anybody been murdered, apart from Miss Hemlock's neighbours?\"</p><p>\"Please,\" Debbie smiled. \"Call me Debbie.\"</p><p>\"If he won't, I certainly will,\" Vancha grinned and leant across to pat her hand again. I felt like saying something rude, but constrained myself. Vancha saw me puffing up and winked suggestively.</p><p>We told Mr. Crepsley and Vancha how quiet things had been before 'Hooky' attacked me in the alley. \"I don't like the sound of this Hooky,\" Vancha grumbled. \"I've never heard of a hook-handed vampaneze before. By tradition, a vampaneze would rather do without a lost leg or arm than replace it with an artificial limb. It's strange.\"</p><p>\"What is stranger is that he has not attacked since,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"If this vampaneze is in league with those who sent Darrens particulars to Mahler's, he knows the address of this hotel - so why not attack him here?\"</p><p>\"You think there might be two bands of vampaneze at work?\" Vancha asked.</p><p>\"Possibly. Or it could be that the vampaneze are responsible for the murders, while another - perhaps Desmond Tiny - set up Darren at school. Mr. Tiny could also have arranged for the hook-handed vampaneze to cross paths with Darren.\"</p>","<p>\"But how did Hooky recognize Darren?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"Maybe by the scent of Darren's blood,\" Mr. Crepsley said.</p><p>\"I don't like this,\" Vancha grumbled. \"Too many 'ifs' and 'buts'. Too twisted by far. I say we get out and leave the humans to fend for themselves.\"</p><p>\"I am inclined to agree with you,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"It pains me to say it, but perhaps our purposes would be best served by retreat.\"</p><p>\"Then retreat and be damned!\" Debbie snapped, and we all stared at her as she got to her feet and faced Mr. Crepsley and Vancha, hands bunched into fists, eyes on fire. \"What sort of monsters are you?\" she snarled. \"You talk of people as if we're inferior beings who don't matter!\"</p><p>\"May I remind you, madam,\" Mr. Crepsley replied stiffly, \"that we came here to fight the vampaneze and protect you and your kind?\"</p><p>\"Should we be grateful?\" she sneered. \"You did what anyone with even a trace of humanity would have done. And before you come back with that 'We aren't human' crud, you don't have to be human to be humane!\"</p><p>\"She's a fiery wench, isn't she?\" Vancha remarked to me in a stage-whisper. \"I could easily fall in love with a woman like this.\"</p><p>\"Fall somewhere else,\" I responded quickly.</p><p>Debbie paid no attention to our brief bit of interplay. Her eyes were fixed on Mr. Crepsley, who was gazing coolly back at her. \"Would you ask us to stay and sacrifice our lives?\" he said quietly.</p><p>\"I'm asking nothing,\" she retorted. \"But if you leave and the killing continues, will you be able to live with yourselves? Can you turn a deaf ear to the cries of those who'll die?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley maintained eye contact with Debbie a few beats more, then averted his gaze and muttered softly, \"No.\" Debbie sat, satisfied. \"But we cannot chase shadows indefinitely,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Darren, Vancha and I are on a mission, which has been deferred too long already. We must think about moving on.\"</p><p>He faced Vancha. \"I suggest we remain one more week, until the end of next weekend. We will do all in our power to engage the vampaneze, but if they continue to evade us, we should concede defeat and withdraw.\"</p><p>Vancha nodded slowly. \"I'd rather get out now, but that's acceptable. Darren?\"</p><p>\"A week,\" I agreed, then caught Debbie's eye and shrugged. \"It's the best we can do,\" I whispered.</p><p>\"I can do more,\" Harkat said. \"I am not tied to the mission as you... three are. I will stay beyond the deadline, if matters... are not resolved by then.\"</p><p>\"Me too,\" Steve said. \"I wont quit until the end.\"</p><p>\"Thank you,\" Debbie said softly. \"Thank you all.\" Then she grinned weakly at me and said, \"All for one and one for all?\"</p><p>I grinned back. \"All for one and one for all,\" I agreed, and then everyone in the room repeated it, unbidden, one at a time - although Mr. Crepsley did glance at Steve and grunt ironically when it was his turn to make the vow!</p><p>Chapter SIXTEEN</p><p>IT WAS almost dawn before we got to bed (Debbie dismissed her police guard earlier in the night). Everyone crammed into the two hotel rooms. Harkat, Vancha and I slept on the floor, Mr. Crepsley in his bed, Steve on the couch, and Debbie in the bed in the other room. Vancha had offered to share Debbie's bed if she wanted someone to keep her warm.</p><p>\"Thanks,\" she'd said coyly, \"but I'd rather sleep with an orangutan.\"</p><p>\"She likes me!\" Vancha declared as she left. \"They always play hard to get when they like me!\"</p><p>At dusk, Mr. Crepsley and I checked out of the hotel. Now that Vancha, Steve and Debbie had joined us, we needed to find somewhere quieter. Steve's almost deserted apartment block was ideal. We took over the two apartments next to his and moved straight in. A quick spot of tidying-up and the rooms were ready to inhabit. They weren't comfortable - they were cold and damp - but they'd suffice.</p><p>Then it was time to go vampaneze hunting.</p><p>We paired off into three teams. I wanted to go with Debbie, but Mr. Crepsley said it would be better if she accompanied one of the full-vampires. Vancha immediately offered to be her partner, but I put a quick stop to that idea. In the end we agreed that Debbie would go with Mr. Crepsley, Steve with Vancha, and Harkat with me.</p><p>Along with our weapons, each of us carried a mobile phone. Vancha didn't like phones - a tom-tom drum was the closest he'd got to modern telecommunications - but we convinced him that it made sense - this way, if one of us found the vampaneze, we'd be able to summon the others swiftly.</p><p>Disregarding the tunnels we'd already examined, and those that were used regularly by humans, we divided up the city's underground terrain into three sectors, assigned one per team, and descended into darkness.</p><p>A long, disappointing night lay ahead of us. Nobody found any trace of the vampaneze, although Vancha and Steve discovered a human corpse that had been stashed away by the blood-suckers many weeks earlier. They made a note of where it was, and Steve said he'd inform the authorities later, when we'd finished searching, so the body could be claimed and buried.</p><p>Debbie looked like a ghost when we met at Steve's apartment the following morning. Her hair was wet and scraggly, her clothes torn, her cheeks scratched, her hands cut by sharp stones and old pipes. While I cleaned out her cuts and bandaged her hands, she stared ahead at the wall, dark rims around her eyes.</p><p>\"How do you do it, night after night?\" she asked in a weak voice.</p><p>\"We're stronger than humans,\" I replied. \"Fitter and faster. I tried telling you that before, but you wouldn't listen.\"</p><p>\"But Steve isn't a vampire.\"</p><p>\"He works out. And he's had years of practice.\" I paused and studied her weary brown eyes. \"You don't have to come with us,\" I said. \"You could co-ordinate the search from here. You'd be more use up here than-\"</p><p>\"No,\" she interrupted firmly. \"I said I'd do it and I will.\"</p><p>\"OK,\" I sighed. I finished dressing her wounds and helped her hobble to bed. We'd said nothing about our argument on Friday - this wasn't the time for personal problems.</p><p>Mr. Crepsley was smiling when I returned. \"She will make it,\" he said.</p><p>\"You think so?\" I asked.</p><p>He nodded. \"I made no allowances. I held to a steady pace. Yet she kept up and did not complain. It has taken its toll - that is natural - but she will be stronger after a good day's sleep. She will not let us down.\"</p>","<p>Debbie looked no better when she woke late that evening, but perked up after a hot meal and shower, and was first out the door, nipping down to the shops to buy a strong pair of gloves, water-resistant boots and new clothes. She also tied her hair back and wore a baseball cap, and when we parted that night, I couldn't help admiring how fierce (but beautiful) she looked. I was glad it wasn't me she was coming after with the arrow gun she'd borrowed from Steve!</p><p>Wednesday was another wash-out, as was Thursday. We knew the vampaneze were down here, but the system of tunnels was vast, and it seemed as if we were never going to find them. Early Friday morning, as Harkat and I were making our way back to base, I stopped at a newspaper stand to buy some papers and catch up with the news. This was the first time since the weekend that I'd paused to check on the state of the world, and as I thumbed through the uppermost paper, a small article caught my eye and I came to a stop.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>I didn't answer. I was too busy reading. The article was about a boy the police were looking for. He was missing, a presumed victim of the killers who'd struck again on Tuesday, murdering a young girl. The wanted boy's name? Darren Horston!</p><p>I discussed the article with Mr. Crepsley and Vancha after Debbie had gone to bed (I didn't want to alarm her). It said simply that I'd been at school on Monday and hadn't been seen since. The police had checked up on me, as they were checking on all students who'd gone absent without contacting their schools (I forgot to phone in to say that I was sick). When they couldn't find me, they'd issued a general description and a plea for anyone who knew anything about me to come forward. They were also 'interested in talking to' my 'father - Vur Horston'.</p><p>I suggested ringing Mahler's to say I was OK, but Mr. Crepsley thought it would be better if I went in personally. \"If you call, they may want to send someone to interview you. And if we ignore the problem, someone might spot you and alert the police.\"</p><p>We agreed I should go in, pretend I'd been sick and that my father moved me to my uncle's house for the good of my health. I'd stay for a few classes - just long enough to assure everyone that I was OK - then say I felt sick again and ask one of my teachers to call my 'uncle' Steve to collect me. He'd remark to the teacher that my father had gone for a job interview, which would be the excuse we'd use on Monday - my father got the job, had to start straightaway, and had sent for me to join him in another city.</p><p>It was an unwelcome distraction, but I wanted to be free to throw my weight behind the search for the vampaneze this weekend, so I dressed up in my school uniform and headed in. I reported to Mr. Chivers' office twenty minutes before the start of class, thinking I'd have to wait for the perennial late-bird, but was surprised to find him in residence. I knocked and entered at his call. \"Darren!\" he gasped when he saw me. He jumped up and grasped my shoulders. \"Where have you been? What happened? Why didn't you call?\"</p><p>I ran through my story and apologized for not contacting him. I said I'd only found out that people were looking for me this morning. I also told him I hadn't been keeping up with the news, and that my father was away on business. Mr. Chivers scolded me for not letting them know where I was, but was too relieved to find me safe and well to bear me a grudge.</p><p>\"I'd almost given up on you,\" he sighed, running a hand through hair that hadn't been washed lately. He looked old and shaken. \"Wouldn't it have been awful if you'd been taken as well? Two in a week... It doesn't bear thinking about.\"</p><p>\"Two, sir?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Yes. Losing Tara was terrible, but if we'd-\"</p><p>\"Tara?\" I interrupted sharply.</p><p>\"Tara Williams. The girl who was killed last Tuesday.\" He stared at me incredulously. \"Surely you heard.\"</p><p>\"I read the name in the papers. Was she a student at Mahler's?\"</p><p>\"Great heavens, boy, don't you know?\" he boomed.</p><p>\"Know what?\"</p><p>\"Tara Williams was a classmate of yours! That's why we were so worried - we thought maybe the two of you had been together when the killer struck.\"</p><p>I ran the name through my memory banks but couldn't match it to a face. I'd met lots of people since coming to Mahler's, but hadn't got to know many, and hardly any of the few I knew were girls.</p><p>\"You must know her,\" Mr. Chivers insisted. \"You sat next to her in English!\"</p><p>I froze, her face suddenly clicking into place. A small girl, light brown hair, silver braces on her teeth, very quiet. She'd sat to the left of me in English. She let me share her poetry book one day when I left mine in the hotel by accident.</p><p>\"Oh, no,\" I moaned, certain this was no coincidence.</p><p>\"Are you all right?\" Mr. Chivers asked. \"Would you care for something to drink?\"</p><p>I shook my head numbly. \"Tara Williams,\" I muttered weakly, feeling a chill spread through my body from the inside out. First Debbie's neighbours. Now one of my classmates. Who would be next...?</p><p>\"Oh, no!\" I moaned again, but louder this time. Because I'd just remembered who sat to my right in English - Richard!</p><p>Chapter SEVENTEEN</p><p>I ASKED Mr. Chivers if I could take the day off. I said I hadn't been feeling well to begin with, and couldn't face classes with the thought of Tara on my mind. He agreed that I'd be better off at home. \"Darren,\" he said as I was leaving, \"will you stay in this weekend and take care?\"</p><p>\"Yes, sir,\" I lied, then hurried downstairs to look for Richard.</p><p>Smickey Martin and a couple of his friends were lounging by the entrance as I hit the ground floor. He'd said nothing to me since our run-in on the stairs - he'd shown his true yellow colours by fleeing - but he called out jeeringly when he saw me. \"Look what the cat's dragged in! Shame - I thought the vampires had done for you, like they did for Ta-ta Williams.\" Pausing, I stomped across to face him. He looked wary. \"Watch yourself, Horsty,\" he growled. \"If you get in my face, I'll-\"</p><p>I grabbed the front of his jumper, lifted him off the ground and held him high above my head. He shrieked like a little child and slapped and kicked at me, but I didn't let go, only shook him roughly until he was quiet. \"I'm looking for Richard Montrose,\" I said. \"Have you seen him?\" Smickey glared at me and said nothing. With my left fingers and thumb, I caught his nose and squeezed until he wailed. \"Have you seen him?\" I asked again.</p>","<p>\"Yuhs!\" he squealed.</p><p>I let go of his nose. \"When? Where?\"</p><p>\"A few minutes ago,\" he mumbled. \"Heading for the computer room.\"</p><p>I sighed, relieved, and gently lowered Smickey. \"Thanks,\" I said. Smickey told me what I could do with my thanks. Smiling, I waved a sarcastic goodbye to the humbled bully, then left the building, satisfied that Richard was safe - at least until night...</p><p>At Steve's I woke the sleeping vampires and humans - Harkat was already awake - and discussed the latest twist with them. This was the first Debbie had heard about the murdered girl - she hadn't seen the papers - and the news struck her hard. \"Tara,\" she whispered, tears in her eyes. \"What sort of a beast would pick on an innocent young child like Tara?\"</p><p>I told them about Richard, and put forward the proposal that he was next on the vampaneze hit list. \"Not necessarily,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"I think they will go after another of your classmates - just as they executed those living to either side of Debbie - but they might go for the boy or girl sitting in front of or behind you.\"</p><p>\"But Richard's my friend,\" I pointed out. \"I barely know the others.\"</p><p>\"I do not think the vampaneze are aware of that,\" he said. \"If they were, they would have targeted Richard first.\"</p><p>\"We need to stake out all three,\" Vancha said. \"Do we know where they live?\"</p><p>\"I can find out,\" Debbie said, wiping tears from her cheeks. Vancha tossed her a dirty scrap of cloth, which she accepted gratefully. \"The student files are accessible by remote computer. I know the password. I'll go to an Internet cafe, tap into the files and get their addresses.\"</p><p>\"What do we do when - if- they attack?\" Steve asked.</p><p>\"We do to them what they did to Tara,\" Debbie growled before any of the rest of us could answer.</p><p>\"You think that's wise?\" Steve responded. \"We know there's more than one of them in operation, but I doubt they'll all turn out to kill a child. Wouldn't it be wiser to trace the attacker back to-\"</p><p>\"Hold on,\" Debbie interrupted. \"Are you saying we let them kill Richard or one of the others?\"</p><p>\"It makes sense. Our primary aim is to-\"</p><p>Debbie slapped his face before he got any further. \"Animal!\" she hissed.</p><p>Steve stared at her emotionlessly. \"I am what I have to be,\" he said. \"We won't stop the vampaneze by being civilized.\"</p><p>\"You... you...\" She couldn't think of anything dreadful enough to call him.</p><p>\"He's got a point,\" Vancha interceded. Debbie turned on him, appalled. \"Well, he has,\" Vancha grumbled, dropping his gaze. \"I don't like the idea of letting them kill another child, but if it means saving others...\"</p><p>\"No,\" Debbie said. \"No sacrifices. I won't allow it.\"</p><p>\"Me neither,\" I said.</p><p>\"Have you an alternative suggestion?\" Steve asked.</p><p>\"Injury,\" Mr. Crepsley answered when the rest of us were silent. \"We stake out the houses, wait for a vampaneze, then shoot him with an arrow before he strikes. But we do not kill him - we target his legs or arms. Then we follow and, if we are lucky, he will lead us back to his companions.\"</p><p>\"I dunno,\" Vancha muttered. \"You, me and Darren can't use those guns - it's not the vampire way - which means we'll have to rely upon the aim of Steve, Harkat and Debbie.\"</p><p>\"I won't miss,\" Steve vowed.</p><p>\"I won't either,\" Debbie said.</p><p>\"Nor me,\" Harkat added.</p><p>\"Maybe you won't,\" Vancha agreed, \"but if there are two or more of them, you won't have time to target a second - the arrow guns are single-shooters.\"</p><p>\"It is a risk we must take,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Now, Debbie, you should go to one of these inferno net cafes and find the addresses as soon as possible, then get to bed and sleep. We must be ready for action when night comes.\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley and Debbie staked out the house of Derek Barry, the boy who sat in front of me in English. Vancha and Steve took responsibility for Gretchen Kelton (Gretch the Wretch, as Smickey Martin called her), who sat behind me. Harkat and I covered the Montrose household.</p><p>Friday was a dark, cold, wet night. Richard lived in a big house with his parents and several brothers and sisters. There were lots of upper windows the vampaneze could use to get in. We couldn't cover them all. But vampaneze almost never kill people in their homes - it was how the myth that vampires can't cross a threshold without being invited started - and although Debbie's neighbours had been killed in their apartments, all the others had been attacked in the open.</p><p>Nothing happened that night. Richard stayed indoors the whole time. I caught glimpses of him and his family through the curtains every now and then, and envied them their simple lives - none of the Montroses would ever have to stake out a house, anticipating an attack by dark-souled monsters of the night.</p><p>When the family was all in bed and the lights went off, Harkat and I took to the roof of the building, where we remained the rest of the night, hidden in the shadows, keeping guard. We left with the rising sun and met the others back at the apartments. They'd had a quiet night too. Nobody had seen any vampaneze.</p><p>\"The army are back,\" Vancha noted, referring to the soldiers who'd returned to guard the streets following the murder of Tara Williams. \"We'll have to take care not to get in their way - they could mistake us for the killers and open fire.\"</p><p>After Debbie had gone to bed, the rest of us discussed our post-weekend plans. Although Mr. Crepsley, Vancha and I had agreed to leave on Monday if we hadn't run down the vampaneze, I thought we should reconsider - things had changed with the murder of Tara and the threat to Richard.</p><p>The vampires were having none of it. \"A vow's a vow,\" Vancha insisted. \"We set a deadline and must stick to it. If we postpone leaving once, we'll postpone again.\"</p><p>\"Vancha is right,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed. \"Whether we sight our opponents or not, on Monday we leave. It will not be pleasant, but our quest takes priority. We must do what is best for the clan.\"</p><p>I had to go along with them. Indecision is the source of chaos, as Paris Skyle used to say. This wasn't the time to risk a rift with my two closest allies.</p><p>As things worked out, I needn't have worried, because late that Saturday, with heavy clouds masking an almost full moon, the vampaneze finally struck - and all bloody hell broke loose!</p>","<p>Chapter EIGHTEEN</p><p>HARKAT SAW him first. It was a quarter past eight. Richard and one of his brothers had left the house to go to a nearby shop and were returning with bags full of shopping. We'd shadowed them every step of the way. Richard was laughing at some joke his brother had cracked, when Harkat put a hand on my shoulder and pointed to the skyline. It took me no more than a second to spot the figure crossing the roof of a large apartment store, trailing the boys below.</p><p>\"Is it Hooky?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" I said, straining my eyes. \"He's not close enough to the edge. I can't see.\"</p><p>The brothers were approaching the mouth of an alley that they had to walk through to get home. That was the logical place for the vampaneze to strike, so Harkat and I hurried after the boys, until we were only a few metres behind when they turned off the main street. We hung back as they started down the alley. Harkat produced his arrow gun (he'd removed the trigger-guard, to accommodate his large finger) and loaded it. I took a couple of throwing knives (courtesy of Vancha) from my belt, ready to back Harkat up if he missed.</p><p>Richard and his brother were halfway down the alley when the vampaneze appeared. I saw his gold and silver hooks first - it was Hooky! - then his head came into view, masked by a balaclava as it had been before. He would have seen us if he'd checked, but he had eyes only for the humans.</p><p>Hooky advanced to the edge of the wall, then skulked along after the brothers, stealthy as a cat. He presented a perfect target, and I was tempted to tell Harkat to shoot to kill. But there were other fish in the vampaneze sea, and if we didn't use this one as bait, we'd never catch them. \"His left leg,\" I whispered. \"Below the knee. That'll slow him down.\"</p><p>Harkat nodded without taking his eyes off the vampaneze. I could see Hooky preparing to leap. I wanted to ask Harkat what he was waiting for, but that would have distracted him. Then, as Hooky crouched low to jump, Harkat squeezed the trigger and sent his arrow flying through the darkness. It struck Hooky exactly where I'd suggested. The vampaneze howled with pain and toppled clumsily from the wall. Richard and his brother jumped and dropped their bags. They stared at the person writhing on the floor, not sure whether to flee or go to his aid.</p><p>\"Get out of here!\" I roared, stepping forward, covering my face with my hands so that Richard couldn't identify me.</p><p>\"Run now if you want to live!\" That decided them. Leaving the bags, they bolted. For a couple of humans, it was amazing how fast they could run.</p><p>Hooky, meanwhile, was back on his feet. \"My leg!\" he roared, tugging at the arrow. But Steve was a cunning designer and it wouldn't come loose. Hooky pulled again, harder, and it snapped off in his hand, leaving the head embedded in the muscles of his lower leg. \"Aiiiieeee!\" Hooky screamed, throwing the useless shaft at us.</p><p>\"Move in,\" I said to Harkat, deliberately louder than necessary. \"We'll trap him and finish him off.\"</p><p>Hooky stiffened when he heard that, the whimpers dying on his lips. Realizing the danger he was in, he tried leaping back up on to the wall. But his left leg was no good and he couldn't manage the jump. Cursing, he pulled a knife out of his belt and propelled it towards us. We had to duck sharply to avoid it, which gave Hooky the time he needed to turn and flee - exactly what we wanted!</p><p>As we started after the vampaneze, Harkat phoned the others and told them what was happening. It was his job to keep them informed of developments - I had to focus on Hooky and make sure we didn't lose him.</p><p>He'd disappeared from sight when I reached the end of the alley, and for an awful moment I thought he'd escaped. But then I saw drops of blood on the pavement and followed them to the mouth of another alley, where I found him scaling a low wall. I let him get up, and then on to the roof of a neighbouring house, before going after him. It suited my purposes far better to have him up above the streets for the duration of the chase, illuminated by the glow of street lamps, out of the way of police and soldiers.</p><p>Hooky was waiting for me on the roof. He'd torn tiles loose and launched them at me, howling like a rabid dog. I dodged one, but had to use my hands to protect myself from the other. It shattered over my knuckles, but caused no real damage. The hook-handed vampaneze advanced, snarling. I was momentarily confused when I noticed that one of his eyes no longer glowed red - it was an ordinary blue or green colour - but I'd no time to mull it over. Bringing my knives up, I prepared to meet the killer's challenge. I didn't want to kill him before he'd had a chance to lead us back to his companions, but if I had to, I would.</p><p>Before he could test me, Vancha and Steve appeared. Steve fired an arrow at the vampaneze - missing on purpose - and Vancha leapt on to the wall. Hooky howled again, sent another few tiles flying towards us, then scrambled up the roof and down the other side.</p><p>\"Are you OK?\" Vancha asked, stopping beside me.</p><p>\"Yes. We got him in the leg. He's bleeding.\"</p><p>\"I noticed.\"</p><p>There was a small pool of blood nearby. I dipped a finger into it and sniffed. It smelt of vampaneze blood, but I still asked Vancha to test it. \"It's vampaneze,\" he said, tasting it. \"Why wouldn't it be?\" I explained about Hooky's eyes. \"Strange,\" he grunted, but said no more. Helping me to my feet, he scuttled to the top of the roof, checked to make sure Hooky wasn't lying in wait for us, then beckoned me to follow. The chase was on!</p><p>While Vancha and I trailed the vampaneze across the rooftops, Harkat and Steve kept abreast of us on the ground, slowing only to negotiate their way around roadblocks or police patrols. About five minutes into the chase, Mr. Crepsley and Debbie connected with us, Debbie joining those below, the vampire taking to the roofs.</p><p>We could have closed in on Hooky - he was having a hard time, slowed by his injured leg, the pain and loss of blood - but we allowed him to remain ahead of us. There was no way he could ditch us up here. If we'd wanted to kill him, it would have been a simple matter to reel him in. But we didn't want to kill him - yet!</p><p>\"We mustn't let him grow suspicious,\" Vancha said after several minutes of silence. \"If we hang back too long, he'll guess something's up. Time to drive him to earth.\" Vancha moved ahead of us, until he was within shuriken-throwing range of the vampaneze. He took a throwing star from the belts looped around his chest, aimed carefully and sent it skimming off a chimney just above Hooky's head.</p>","<p>Whirling, the vampaneze shouted something unintelligible back at us and angrily shook a golden hook. Vancha silenced him with another shuriken, which flew even closer to its mark than the first. Dropping to his belly, Hooky slid to the edge of the roof, where he grabbed on to the guttering with his hooks, halting his fall. He hung over open space a moment, checked the area underneath, jerked his hooks clear of the guttering and then dropped. It was a four-storey fall, but that was nothing to a vampaneze.</p><p>\"Here we go,\" Mr. Crepsley muttered, making for a nearby fire escape. \"Call the others and warn them - we do not want them running into him on the streets.\"</p><p>I did that while jogging down the steps of the fire escape. They were a block and a half behind us. I told them to hold position until further notice. While Mr. Crepsley and I followed the vampaneze on the ground, Vancha kept sight of him from the rooftops, making sure he couldn't take to the roofs again, narrowing his options so that he had to choose between the streets and the tunnels.</p><p>After three minutes of frenzied running, he chose the tunnels.</p><p>We found a discarded manhole cover and a trail of blood leading down into the darkness. \"This is it,\" I sighed nervously as we stood waiting for Vancha. I hit the redial button on my mobile and summoned the others. When they arrived, we paired off into our regular teams, and climbed down into the tunnels. Each of us knew what we had to do and no words were exchanged.</p><p>Vancha and Steve led the pursuit. The rest of us trailed behind, covering adjacent tunnels, so Hooky couldn't double back. It wasn't easy tracking Hooky down here. The water in the tunnels had washed much of his blood away, and the darkness made it hard to see very far ahead. But we'd become accustomed to these tight, dark spaces, and we moved quickly and efficiently, keeping close, picking up on the slightest identifying marks.</p><p>Hooky led us deeper into the tunnels than we'd ever been. Even the mad vampaneze, Murlough, hadn't delved this deeply into the underbelly of the city. Was Hooky heading for his companions and help, or simply trying to lose us?</p><p>\"We must be nearing the city limits,\" Harkat remarked as we rested a moment. \"The tunnels must run out soon, or else...\"</p><p>\"What?\" I asked when he didn't continue.</p><p>\"They could open up,\" he said. \"Perhaps he is making a break... for freedom. If he reaches open countryside and... has a clear run, he can flit to safety.\"</p><p>\"Won't his wounds stop him doing that?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Perhaps. But if he is desperate enough... perhaps not.\"</p><p>We resumed the chase and caught up with Vancha and Steve. Harkat told Vancha what he thought Hooky was planning. Vancha replied that he'd already thought of that, and was gradually closing in on the fleeing vampaneze - if Hooky angled for the surface, Vancha would head him off and make an end of him.</p><p>But, to our surprise, instead of heading upwards, the vampaneze led us ever further down. I'd no idea the tunnels ran this deep, and couldn't imagine what they were for - they were modern in design, and showed no signs of having been used. As I was pondering it, Vancha came to a standstill and I almost walked into him.</p><p>\"What is it?\" I asked.</p><p>\"He's stopped,\" Vancha whispered. \"There's a room or cave up ahead and he's come to a halt.\"</p><p>\"Waiting for us, to make a final stand?\" I suggested.</p><p>\"Perhaps,\" Vancha replied uneasily. \"He's lost a lot of blood and the pace of the chase must be sapping his energy. But why stop now? Why here?\" He shook his head. \"I don't like it.\"</p><p>As Mr. Crepsley and Debbie arrived, Steve unstrapped his arrow gun and loaded it by torchlight.</p><p>\"Careful!\" I hissed. \"He'll see the light.\"</p><p>Steve shrugged. \"So? He knows we're here. We might as well operate by light as in darkness.\"</p><p>That made sense, so we all lit the torches we'd brought, keeping the lights dim so as not to create too many distracting shadows.</p><p>\"Do we go after him,\" Steve asked, \"or stay here and wait for him to attack?\"</p><p>\"We go in,\" Mr. Crepsley answered after the briefest of pauses.</p><p>\"Aye,\" Vancha said. \"In.\"</p><p>I studied Debbie. She was trembling and looked ready to collapse. \"You can wait out here if you like,\" I told her.</p><p>\"No,\" she said. \"I'm coming.\" She stopped trembling. \"For Tara.\"</p><p>\"Steve and Debbie will keep to the back,\" Vancha said, loosening a few of his shurikens. \"Larten and I will lead. Darren and Harkat in the middle.\" Everybody nodded obediently. \"If he's alone, I'll take him,\" Vancha went on. \"An even fight, one-on-one. If he has company-\" he grinned humourlessly \"-it's everyone for themselves.\"</p><p>One final check to make sure we were ready and he advanced, Mr. Crepsley to his right, Harkat and I close behind, Steve and Debbie bringing up the rear.</p><p>We found ourselves in a large, domed room, modern like the tunnels. A handful of candles jutted from the walls, casting a gloomy, flickering light. There was another way into the room directly across from us, but it was barred by a heavy, round, metal door, like those used for walk-in safes in banks. Hooky had squatted a few metres in front of the door. His knees were drawn up to cover his face, and his hands were busy trying to pry the arrow head from his leg.</p><p>We fanned out, Vancha in front, the rest of us forming a protective semi-circle behind him. \"The game's over,\" Vancha said, holding back, examining the shadows for traces of other vampaneze.</p><p>\"Think so?\" Hooky snorted and looked up at us with his one red eye and one blue-green. \"I think it's only beginning.\" The vampaneze clashed his hooks together. Once. Twice. Three times.</p><p>And someone dropped from the ceiling.</p><p>The someone landed beside Hooky. Stood and faced us. His face was purple and his eyes were blood-red - a vampaneze. Someone else dropped. Another. More. I felt sick inside as I watched vampaneze drop. There were human vampets among them too, dressed in brown shirts and black trousers, with skinned heads, a tattooed 'V above either ear, and red circles painted around their eyes, carrying rifles, pistols and crossbows.</p><p>I counted nine vampaneze and fourteen vampets, not including Hooky. We'd walked into a trap, and as I stared around at the armed, grim-faced warriors, I knew we'd need all the luck of the vampires just to scrape out of this alive.</p><p>Chapter NINETEEN</p>","<p>AS POOR as the odds were, they were about to get even worse. As we stood awaiting the onslaught, the huge door behind Hooky opened and four more vampaneze stepped through to join the others. That made it twenty-eight to six. We hadn't a hope.</p><p>\"Not so pleased with yourselves now, are you?\" Hooky jeered, hobbling forward a few gleeful paces.</p><p>\"I don't know about that,\" Vancha sniffed. \"This just means more of you for us to kill.\"</p><p>Hooky's smile vanished. \"Are you arrogant or ignorant?\" he snapped.</p><p>\"Neither,\" Vancha said, gazing calmly at our foes. \"I'm a vampire.\"</p><p>\"You really think you stand a chance against us?\" Hooky sneered.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Vancha answered softly. \"Were we fighting honest, noble vampaneze, I'd think otherwise. But a vampaneze who sends armed humans to fight his battles is a coward, without honour. I have nothing to fear from such pitiable beasts.\"</p><p>\"Be careful what you say,\" the vampaneze to the left of Hooky growled. \"We don't take kindly to insults.\"</p><p>\"We're the ones who've been insulted,\" Vancha replied. \"There's honour in dying at the hands of a worthy foe. If you'd sent your best warriors against us and killed us, we'd have died with smiles on our lips. But to send these... these...\" He spat into the dust of the floor. \"There's no word low enough to describe them.\"</p><p>The vampets bristled at that, but the vampaneze looked uneasy, almost ashamed, and I realized they were no fonder of the vampets than we were. Vancha noticed this too and slowly loosened his belts of shurikens. \"Drop your arrow guns,\" he said to Steve, Harkat and Debbie. They stared at him dumbly. \"Do it!\" he insisted gruffly and they complied. Vancha held up his bare hands. \"We've put our long-range weapons aside. Will you order your pets to do the same and engage us honourably - or will you have us shot down in cold blood like the curs I think you are?\"</p><p>\"Shoot them!\" Hooky screamed, his voice laced with hatred. \"Shoot them all!\"</p><p>The vampets raised their weapons and took aim.</p><p>\"No!\" the vampaneze to Hooky's left bellowed and the vampets paused. \"By all the shadows of the night, I say no!\"</p><p>Hooky whirled on him. \"Are you crazy?\"</p><p>\"Beware,\" the vampaneze warned him. \"If you cross me on this, I'll kill you where you stand.\"</p><p>Hooky stepped back, stunned. The vampaneze faced the vampets. \"Drop your guns,\" he commanded. \"We'll fight with our traditional weapons. With honour.\"</p><p>The vampets obeyed the order. Vancha turned and winked at us while they were laying their weapons aside. Then he faced the vampaneze again. \"Before we start,\" he said, \"I'd like to know what manner of creature this thing with the hooks is.\"</p><p>\"I'm a vampaneze!\" Hooky replied indignantly.</p><p>\"Really?\" Vancha smirked. \"I've never seen one with mismatched eyes before.\"</p><p>Hooky's eyes twitched exploratively. \"Damn!\" he shouted. \"It must have slipped out when I fell.\"</p><p>\"What slipped out?\" Vancha asked.</p><p>\"A contact lens,\" I answered softly. \"He's wearing red contact lenses.\"</p><p>\"No I'm not!\" Hooky yelled. \"That's a lie! Tell them, Bargen. My eyes are as red as yours and my skin's as purple.\"</p><p>The vampaneze to Hooky's left shuffled his feet with embarrassment. \"He is a vampaneze,\" he said, \"but he's only been recently blooded. He wanted to look like the rest of us, so he wears contacts and...\" Bargen coughed into a fist. \"He paints his face and body purple.\"</p><p>\"Traitor!\" Hooky howled.</p><p>Bargen looked up at him, disgusted, then spat into the dust of the floor as Vancha had moments before.</p><p>\"What has the world come to when the vampaneze blood maniacs like this and recruit humans to fight for them?\"</p><p>Vancha asked quietly and there was no mockery in his voice - it was a genuine, puzzled query.</p><p>\"Times change,\" Bargen answered. \"We don't like the changes, but we accept them. Our Lord has said it must be so.\"</p><p>\"This is what the great Lord of the Vampaneze has brought to his people?\" Vancha barked. \"Human thugs and crazy, hook-handed monsters?\"</p><p>\"I'm not crazy!\" Hooky shouted. \"Except crazy with rage!\" He pointed at me and snarled. \"And it's all his fault.\"</p><p>Vancha turned and stared at me, as did everybody else in the room.</p><p>\"Darren?\" Mr. Crepsley asked quietly.</p><p>\"I don't know what he's talking about,\" I said.</p><p>\"Liar!\" Hooky laughed and started dancing. \"Liar, liar, pants on fire!\"</p><p>\"Do you know this creature!\" Mr. Crepsley enquired.</p><p>\"No,\" I insisted. \"The first time I saw him was when he attacked me in the alley. I never-\"</p><p>\"Lies!\" Hooky screamed, then stopped dancing and glared at me. \"Pretend all you like, man, but you know who I am. And you know what you did to drive me to this.\" He held up his arms, so the hooks glinted in the light of the candles.</p><p>\"Honestly,\" I swore, \"I haven't a clue what you're on about.\"</p><p>\"No?\" he sneered. \"It's easy to lie to a mask. Let's see if you can stick to your lie when faced with-\" he removed the balaclava with one quick sweep of his left hooks, revealing his face \"- this!\"</p><p>It was a round, heavy, bearded face, smeared with purple paint. For a few seconds I couldn't place it. Then, putting it together with the missing hands, and the familiarity of the voice that I'd previously noted, I nailed him. \"Reggie Veggie?\" I gasped.</p><p>\"Don't call me that!\" he shrieked. \"It's R.V. - and it stands for Righteous Vampaneze!\"</p><p>I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. R.V. was a man I'd run into not long after joining the Cirque Du Freak, an eco-warrior who'd devoted his life to the protection of the countryside. We'd been friends until he found me killing animals to feed the Little People. He set out to free the Wolf Man - he thought we were mistreating him - but the savage beast bit his arms off. The last time I'd seen him, he'd been fleeing into the night, screaming loudly, \"My hands! My hands!\"</p><p>Now he was here. With the vampaneze. And I began to understand why I'd been set up and who was behind it. \"You sent those forms to Mahler's!\" I accused him.</p>","<p>He grinned slyly, then shook his head. \"With hands like these?\" He waved the hooks at me. \"They're good for chopping and slicing and gutting, but not for writing. I played my part to get you down here, but it was one with a lot more cunning than me who dreamt the plan up.\"</p><p>\"I don't understand,\" Vancha interrupted. \"Who is this lunatic?\"</p><p>\"It's a long story,\" I said. \"I'll tell you later.\"</p><p>\"Optimistic to the last,\" Vancha chuckled.</p><p>I stepped closer to R.V., ignoring the threat of the vampaneze and vampets, until I was only a metre or so away. I studied his face silently. He fidgeted but didn't back off. \"What happened to you?\" I asked, appalled. \"You loved life. You were gentle and kind. You were a vegetarian!\"</p><p>\"Not any more,\" R.V. chuckled. \"I eat plenty of meat now and I like it bloody!\" His smile faded. \"You happened to me, you and your band of freaks. You ruined my life, man. I wandered the world, alone, frightened, defenceless, until the vampaneze took me in. They gave me strength. They equipped me with new hands. In turn, I helped give them you.\"</p><p>I shook my head sadly. \"You're wrong. They haven't made you strong. They've turned you into an abomination.\"</p><p>His face darkened. \"Take that back! Take that back or I'll-\"</p><p>\"Before this goes any further,\" Vancha interrupted dryly, \"could I ask one more question? It's my final one.\" R.V. stared at him in silence. \"If you didn't set us up, who did?\" R.V. said nothing. Nor did the other vampaneze. \"Come on!\" Vancha shouted. \"Don't be shy. Who's the clever boy?\"</p><p>The silence held a few moments more. Then, from behind us, somebody said in a soft, wicked voice, \"I am.\"</p><p>I whirled around to see who'd spoken. So did Vancha, Harkat and Mr. Crepsley. But Debbie didn't whirl, because she was standing still, a knife pressed to the soft flesh of her throat. And Steve Leopard didn't whirl either, because he was standing beside her - holding the knife!</p><p>We gawped wordlessly at the pair. I blinked twice, slowly, thinking maybe that would restore sanity to the world. But it didn't. Steve was still there, holding his knife on Debbie, grinning darkly.</p><p>\"Take off your gloves,\" Mr. Crepsley said, his voice strained. \"Take them off and show us your hands.\"</p><p>Steve smiled knowingly, then put the fingertips of his left hand - which was wrapped around Debbie's throat - to his mouth, gripped the ends of the glove with his teeth, and pulled his hand free. The first thing my eyes went to was the cross carved into the flesh of his palm, the cross he'd made the night he vowed to track me down and kill me. Then my eyes slid from his palm to the end of his fingers, and I understood why Mr. Crepsley had asked him to remove the glove.</p><p>There were five small scars running along his fingertips - the sign that he was a creature of the night. But Steve hadn't been blooded by a vampire. He'd been blooded by one of the others. He was a half-vampaneze!</p><p>Chapter TWENTY</p><p>AS THE initial shock faded, a cold, dark hatred grew in the pit of my stomach. I forgot about the vampaneze and vampets and focused entirely on Steve. My best friend. The boy whose life I'd saved. The man I'd welcomed back with open arms. I'd vouched for him. Trusted him. Included him in our plans.</p><p>And all along he'd been plotting against us.</p><p>I would have gone for him there and then, and ripped him to pieces, except he was using Debbie as a shield. Fast as I was, I wouldn't be able to stop him slashing the knife across her throat. If I attacked, Debbie would die.</p><p>\"I knew we could not trust him,\" Mr. Crepsley said, looking only slightly less wrathful than I felt. \"Blood does not change. I should have killed him years ago.\"</p><p>\"Don't be a sore loser,\" Steve laughed, pulling Debbie even tighter in to him.</p><p>\"It was all a ploy, wasn't it?\" Vancha noted. \"The hooked one's attack and your rescue of Darren was staged.\"</p><p>\"Of course,\" Steve smirked. \"I knew where they were all along. I suckered them in, sending R.V. to this city to spread panic among the humans, knowing it would draw Creepy Crepsley back.\"</p><p>\"How did you know?\" Mr. Crepsley asked, astonished.</p><p>\"Research,\" Steve said. \"I found out all I could about you. I made you my life's work. It wasn't easy, but I traced you in the end. Found your birth certificate. Connected you to this place. I teamed up with my good friends, the vampaneze, during the course of my travels. They didn't reject me like you did. Through them I learnt that one of their brethren - poor, deranged Murlough - had gone missing here some years ago. Knowing what I did about you and your movements, it wasn't difficult to join the dots.</p><p>\"What did happen with Murlough?\" Steve asked. \"Did you kill him or merely scare him off?\"</p><p>Mr. Crepsley didn't answer. Nor did I.</p><p>\"No matter,\" Steve said. \"It's not important. But I figured that if you came back to help these people once, you'd do it again.\"</p><p>\"Very clever,\" Mr. Crepsley snarled. His fingers were twitching like spider legs by his sides, and I knew he was itching to wrap them around Steve's throat.</p><p>\"What I don't understand,\" Vancha remarked, \"is what this lot are doing here.\" He nodded at Bargen and the other vampaneze and vampets. \"Surely they're not here to assist you in your insane quest for revenge.\"</p><p>\"Of course not,\" Steve said. \"I'm just a humble half-vampaneze. It's not for me to command my betters. I told them about Murlough, which interested them, but they're here for other reasons, on someone else's say-so.\"</p><p>\"Whose?\" Vancha asked.</p><p>\"That would be telling. And we aren't here to tell - we're here to kill!\"</p><p>Behind us, the vampaneze and vampets advanced. Vancha, Mr. Crepsley and Harkat spun to face their challenge. I didn't. I couldn't tear my eyes away from Steve and Debbie. She was weeping, but holding herself steady, looking appealingly in my direction.</p><p>\"Why?\" I croaked.</p><p>\"Why what?\" Steve replied.</p><p>\"Why do you hate us? We did nothing to hurt you.\"</p><p>\"He said I was evil!\" Steve howled, nodding at Mr. Crepsley, who didn't turn to remonstrate with him. \"And you chose his side over mine. You set that spider on me and tried to kill me.\"</p><p>\"No! I saved you. I gave up everything so that you could live.\"</p>","<p>\"Nonsense,\" he snorted. \"I know what really happened. You plotted with him against me, so you could take my rightful place among the vampires. You were jealous of me.\"</p><p>\"No, Steve,\" I groaned. \"That's madness. You don't know what-\"</p><p>\"Save it!\" Steve interrupted. \"I'm not interested. Besides, here comes the guest of honour - a man I'm sure you're all just dying to meet.\"</p><p>I didn't want to turn away from Steve, but I had to see what he was talking about. Looking over my shoulder, I saw two vague shapes behind the massed vampaneze and vampets. Vancha, Mr. Crepsley and Harkat were ignoring Steve's jibes and the pair at the back, concentrating instead on the foes directly in front of them, warding off their early testing jabs. Then the vampaneze parted slightly and I had a clear view of the two behind them.</p><p>\"Vancha!\" I shouted.</p><p>\"What?\" he snapped.</p><p>\"At the rear - it's...\" I licked my lips. The taller of the pair had spotted me and was gazing at me with a neutral, inquisitive expression. The other was dressed in dark green robes, his face covered by a hood.</p><p>\"Who?\" Vancha shouted, knocking aside a vampets blade with his bare hands.</p><p>\"It's your brother, Gannen Harst,\" I said quietly and Vancha stopped fighting. So did Mr. Crepsley and Harkat. And so, puzzled, did the vampaneze.</p><p>Vancha stood to his fullest height and stared over the heads of those in front of him. Gannen Harst's eyes left mine and locked on Vancha's. The brothers stared at each other. Then Vancha's gaze switched to the person in the robes and hood - the Lord of the Vampaneze!</p><p>\"Him! Here? Vancha gasped.</p><p>\"You've met before, I take it,\" Steve commented snidely.</p><p>Vancha ignored the half-vampaneze. \"Here!\" he gasped again, eyes pinned on the leader of the vampaneze, the man we'd sworn to kill. Then he did the last thing the vampaneze had been expecting - with a roar of pure adrenaline, he charged!</p><p>It was lunacy, one unarmed vampire taking on twenty-eight armed and able opponents, but that lunacy worked in his favour. Before the vampaneze and vampets had time to come to terms with the craziness of Vancha's charge, he'd barrelled through nine or ten of them, knocking them to the ground or into the way of others, and was almost upon Gannen Harst and the Vampaneze Lord before they knew what was happening.</p><p>Seizing the moment, Mr. Crepsley reacted quicker than anyone else and darted after Vancha. He dived among the vampaneze and vampets, knives outstretched in his extended hands like a pair of talons at the end of a bat's wings, and three of our foes fell, throats or chests slit open.</p><p>As Harkat swung in behind the vampires, burying the head of his axe in the skull of a vampet, the last in the line of vampaneze closed ranks on Vancha and blocked his path to their Lord. The Prince lashed at them with his blade-like hands, but they knew what they were doing now, and although he killed one of them, the others surged forward and forced him to a halt.</p><p>I should have gone after my companions - killing the Vampaneze Lord meant more than anything else - but my senses were screaming one name only, and it was a name I reacted to impulsively: \"Debbie?\" Swivelling away from the battle, praying that Steve had been distracted by the sudden outbreak, I sent a knife flying towards him. It wasn't intended to hit - I couldn't risk striking Debbie - just to make him duck.</p><p>It worked. Startled by the swiftness of my move, Steve jerked his head behind Debbie's for protection. His left arm loosened around her throat, and his right hand - holding the knife - dropped a fraction. As I raced forward, I knew the momentary swing of fortune wasn't enough - he'd still have time to recover and kill Debbie before I reached him. But then Debbie, acting like a trained warrior, dug her left elbow sharply back into Steve's ribs, and broke free of his hold, throwing herself to the floor.</p><p>Before Steve could dive after her, I was on him. I grabbed him around the waist and propelled him backwards into the wall. He connected harshly and cried out. Stepping away from him, I sent my right fist smashing into the side of his face. The force of the blow knocked him down. It also nearly broke a couple of small bones in my fingers, but that didn't bother me. Falling upon him, I grabbed his ears, pulled his head up, then smashed it down on the hard concrete floor. He grunted and the lights went out in his eyes. He was dazed and defenceless - mine for the taking.</p><p>My hand went for the hilt of my sword. Then I saw Steves own knife lying close beside his head, and decided it would be more fitting to kill him with that. Picking it up, I positioned it above his dark, monstrous heart and prodded through the material of his shirt to make sure he wasn't protected by a breastplate or some other such armour. Then I raised the knife high above my head and brought it down slowly, determined to strike the mark and put an end to the life of the man I'd once counted as my dearest friend.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-ONE</p><p>\"STOP!\" R.V. screamed as my blade descended, and something in his voice made me pause and look back. My heart sank - he had Debbie! He was holding her as Steve had, the hooks of his golden right hand pressed up into the flesh of her jaw. A couple of hooks had lightly punctured the skin and thin streams of blood trickled down the golden blades. \"Drop the knife or I slit her like a pig!\" R.V. hissed.</p><p>If I dropped the knife, Debbie would die anyway, along with the rest of us. There was only one thing for it - I had to try and force a stand-off. Grabbing Steve by his long grey hair, I jammed my knife against the flesh of his throat. \"If she dies, he dies,\" I growled and I saw doubt fill R.V.'s eyes.</p><p>\"Don't play games with me,\" the hook-handed vampaneze warned. \"Let him go or I kill her.\"</p><p>\"If she dies, he dies,\" I said again.</p><p>R.V. cursed, then glanced over his shoulder for help. The battle was going the way of the vampaneze. Those who'd stumbled in the first few seconds of the fight had regained their feet, and now encircled Vancha, Mr. Crepsley and Harkat, who fought back to back, protecting each other, unable to advance or retreat. Beyond the crush, Gannen Harst and the Lord of the Vampaneze looked on.</p><p>\"Forget about them,\" I said. \"This is between you and me. It's got nothing to do with anybody else.\" I managed a weak smile. \"Or are you afraid to face me on your own?\"</p><p>R.V. sneered. \"I'm afraid of nothing, man. Except...\" He stopped.</p><p>Guessing what he'd been about to say, I put my head back and howled like a wolf. R.V.'s eyes widened with fear at the sound, but then he collected himself and stood firm. \"Howling won't save your tasty little girlfriend,\" he taunted me.</p>","<p>I had a strange sense of deja vu - Murlough used to speak that way about Debbie, and for a moment it was as though the spirit of the dead vampaneze was alive inside R.V. Then I put such macabre thoughts behind me and concentrated.</p><p>\"Let's stop wasting each other's time,\" I said. \"You put Debbie aside, I'll put Steve aside, and we'll settle this man to man, winner takes all.\"</p><p>R.V. grinned and shook his head. \"No deal. I don't have to risk my neck. I'm holding all the cards.\"</p><p>Keeping Debbie in front of him, he edged towards the exit at the opposite side of the room, skirting the vampaneze.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" I shouted, moving to block him.</p><p>\"Stay back!\" he roared, digging his hooks deeper into Debbie's jaw, causing her to gasp with pain.</p><p>I stopped uncertainly. \"Let her go,\" I said quietly, desperately.</p><p>\"No,\" he replied. \"I'm taking her. If you try to stop me, I'll kill her.\"</p><p>\"I'll kill Steve if you do.\"</p><p>He laughed. \"I don't care for Steve as much as you care for precious little Debbie. I'll sacrifice my friend if you'll sacrifice yours. How about it, Shan?\" I studied Debbie's round, terrified eyes, then took a step back, clearing the way for R.V. to pass. \"Wise move,\" he grunted, easing past, not turning his back on me.</p><p>\"If you harm her...\" I sobbed.</p><p>\"I won't,\" he said. \"Not for the time being. I want to see you squirm before I do. But if you kill Steve or come after me...\" His cold, mismatched eyes told me what would happen.</p><p>Laughing, the hook-handed monster slipped past the vampaneze, then past Gannen Harst and his Lord, vanishing into the gloomy darkness of the tunnel beyond, taking Debbie with him, leaving me arid the others to the mercy of the vampaneze.</p><p>Now that Debbie was beyond saving, my choices were clear. I could try to help my friends, who were trapped by the vampaneze, or go after the Vampaneze Lord. It took me no time to choose. I couldn't rescue my friends - there were just too many vampaneze and vampets - and even if I could, I wouldn't have - the Vampaneze Lord came first. I'd momentarily forgotten that when Steve seized Debbie, but now my training reasserted itself. Across the way, Steve was still unconscious. No time to finish him off - I'd do it later, if possible. Sneaking around the vampaneze, drawing my sword, meaning to take on Gannen Harst and the figure he guarded.</p><p>Harst spotted me, put his fingers to his mouth and whistled loudly. Four of the vampaneze at the rear of the group looked to him, then followed the direction of his finger as he pointed towards me. Turning away from the ruckus, they blocked my path, then advanced.</p><p>I might have tried to fight my way through them, hopeless as it was, but then I saw Gannen Harst call another two vampaneze away from the fighting. He gave the Vampaneze Lord to them and they exited down the tunnel that R.V. had fled through. Gannen Harst swung the huge door shut after them and spun a large, circular lock at the centre of it. Without the combination, it would be impossible to get through a door as thick as that.</p><p>Gannen Harst stepped up behind the four vampaneze who were converging on me. He clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth and the vampaneze came to a standstill. Harst looked into my eyes, then made the death's touch sign by pressing his middle finger to the centre of his forehead, the two adjacent fingers over his eyes, and spreading his thumb and little finger out wide. \"Even in death, may you be triumphant,\" he said.</p><p>I glanced around swiftly, taking in the state of play. Close to my right, the battle still raged. Mr. Crepsley, Vancha and Harkat were cut in many places, bleeding liberally, yet none had sustained fatal wounds. They were on their feet, weapons in hand - except Vancha, whose weapons were his hands - keeping the circle of vampaneze and vampets at bay.</p><p>I couldn't understand it. Given our foes' superior numbers, they should have overwhelmed and dispatched the trio by now. The longer the fighting progressed, the more damage we were inflicting - at least six vampets and three vampaneze were dead, and several more nursed life-threatening injuries. Yet still they fought warily, judging their blows with care, almost as though they didn't want to kill us.</p><p>I reached a snap decision and knew what I had to do. I faced Gannen Harst and screamed, \"I'll be triumphant in life!\" in defiance, then whipped out a knife and launched it at the vampaneze, throwing it deliberately high. As the five vampaneze ahead of me ducked to avoid the knife, I swivelled and swung with my sword at the vampaneze and vampets packed tightly around Mr. Crepsley, Vancha and Harkat. Now that the Lord of the Vampaneze was beyond reach, I was free to help or perish with my friends. A few moments earlier, we'd surely have perished, but the pendulum had swung round slightly in our favour. The pack had been whittled down by half a dozen members - two had left with their Lord, and four more were standing with Gannen Harst. The remaining vampaneze and vampets had spread themselves out to cover for their missing clansmen.</p><p>My sword connected with the vampaneze to my right, and narrowly missed the throat of a vampet to my left. The vampaneze and vampet both stepped aside at the same moment, instinctively, in opposite directions, creating a gap. \"To me!\" I cried at the trio trapped in the middle of the mayhem.</p><p>Before the gap could be filled, Harkat burst through, chopping with his axe. More vampaneze and vampets drew back, and Mr. Crepsley and Vancha hurried after Harkat, fanning out around him, turning so that they were all facing the same way, instead of having to fight back to back.</p><p>We retreated swiftly towards the tunnel leading out of the cavern.</p><p>\"Quick - block the exit!\" one of the four vampaneze with Gannen Harst yelled, moving forward to bar our way.</p><p>\"Hold,\" Gannen Harst responded quietly and the vampaneze stopped. He looked back at Harst, puzzled, but Harst only shook his head grimly.</p><p>I wasn't sure why Harst had prevented his men from blocking our one route of escape, but I didn't stop to ponder it. As we backed up towards the exit, lashing out at the vampaneze and vampets who pushed forward after us, we passed Steve. He was regaining his senses and was half sitting up. I paused as we came abreast of him, grabbed him by his hair and hauled him to his feet. He yelped and struggled, but then I stuck the edge of my sword to his throat and he went quiet. \"You're coming with us!\" I hissed in his ear. \"If we die, so do you.\" I'd have killed him then and there, except I remembered what R.V. had said - if I killed Steve, he'd kill Debbie.</p>","<p>As we came to the mouth of the tunnel, a vampet swung a short length of chain at Vancha. The vampire grabbed the chain, yanked the vampet in, caught him by the head, and made to twist it sharply to the right, meaning to snap his neck and kill him.</p><p>\"Enough!\" Gannen Harst bellowed and the vampaneze and vampets closing upon us instantly stopped fighting and dropped back two paces.</p><p>Vancha relaxed his lock, but didn't release the vampet, and glared around suspiciously. \"What now?\" he muttered.</p><p>\"I do not know,\" Mr. Crepsley said, wiping sweat and blood from his brow. \"But they fight most bizarrely. Nothing they do would surprise me.\"</p><p>Gannen Harst pushed through the vampaneze until he was standing in front of his brother. The two didn't look alike - where Vancha was burly, gruff and rough, Gannen was slim, cultured and smooth - but there was a certain way they had of standing and inclining their heads that was very similar.</p><p>\"Vancha,\" Gannen greeted his estranged brother.</p><p>\"Gannen,\" Vancha replied, not letting go of the vampet, watching the other vampaneze like a hawk in case they made any sudden moves.</p><p>Gannen looked at Mr. Crepsley, Harkat and me. \"We meet again,\" he said, \"as was destined. Last time, you had the beating of me. Now the tables have turned.\" He paused and gazed around the room at the silent vampaneze and vampets, then at their dead and dying colleagues. Then he glanced at the tunnel behind us. \"We could kill you here, in this tunnel, but you would take many of us with you,\" he sighed. \"I tire of needless bloodshed. Shall we strike a deal?\"</p><p>\"What sort of a deal?\" Vancha grunted, trying to hide his bewilderment.</p><p>\"It would be easier for us to slaughter you in the larger tunnels beyond this one. We could pick you off, in our own time, possibly without losing more of our men.\"</p><p>\"You want us to make your job easier for you?\" Vancha laughed.</p><p>\"Let me finish,\" Gannen continued. \"As things stand, you have no hope of making it back to the surface alive. If we attack you here, our losses will be great, but all four of you will certainly die. If, on the other hand, we were to give you a head start...\" He trailed off into silence, then spoke again. \"Fifteen minutes, Vancha. Leave your hostages - you can move more quickly without them - and flee. For fifteen minutes, nobody will follow. You have my word.\"</p><p>\"This is a trick,\" Vancha snarled. \"You wouldn't let us go, not like this.\"</p><p>\"I don't lie,\" Gannen said stiffly. \"The odds are still in our favour - we know these tunnels better than you do, and will probably catch you before you make it to freedom. But this way you have hope - and I won't have to bury any more of my friends.\"</p><p>Vancha exchanged a furtive glance with Mr. Crepsley.</p><p>\"What about Debbie?\" I shouted before either vampire could speak. \"I want to take her too!\"</p><p>Gannen Harst shook his head. \"I command those in this room,\" he said, \"but not he of the hooks. She is his now.\"</p><p>\"Not good enough,\" I snorted. \"If Debbie doesn't leave, I don't either. I'll stay here and kill as many of you as I can.\"</p><p>\"Darren-\" Vancha began to protest.</p><p>\"Do not argue,\" Mr. Crepsley intervened. \"I know Darren - your words would be wasted. He will not leave without her. And if he will not leave, nor will I.\"</p><p>Vancha cursed, then looked his brother clean in the eye. \"There you have it. If they won't go, I won't either.\"</p><p>Harkat cleared his throat. \"These fools don't speak... for me. I'll go.\" Then he smiled to show he was joking.</p><p>Gannen spat between his feet, disgusted. In my arms, Steve stirred and groaned. Gannen studied him for a moment, then looked at his brother again. \"Let's try this then,\" Gannen said. \"R.V. and Steve Leonard are close friends. Leonard designed R.V.'s hooks and persuaded us to blood him. I don't think R.V. would kill the woman if it meant Leonard's death, despite his threats. When you leave, you can take Leonard with you. If you escape, perhaps you'll be able to use him to bargain for the woman's life at a later time.\" He squinted at me warningly. \"That is the best I can do - and it's more than you have a right to expect.\"</p><p>I thought it over, realized this was Debbie's only real hope, and nodded imperceptibly.</p><p>\"Is that a yes?\" Gannen asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I croaked.</p><p>\"Then go now!\" he snapped. \"From the moment you start to walk, the clock begins to tick. In fifteen minutes, we come - and if we catch you, you die.\"</p><p>At a signal from Gannen, the vampaneze and vampets drew back and regrouped around him. Gannen stood in front of them all, hands folded across his chest, waiting for us to leave.</p><p>I shuffled forward to my three friends, pushing Steve ahead of me. Vancha still had hold of his captured vampet and was gripping him as I gripped Steve. \"Is he serious?\" I asked in a whisper.</p><p>\"It seems so,\" Vancha replied, though I could tell he hardly believed it either.</p><p>\"Why is he doing this?\" Mr. Crepsley asked. \"He knows it is our mission to kill the Lord of the Vampaneze. By offering us this opportunity, he frees us to perhaps recover and strike again.\"</p><p>\"It's crazy,\" Vancha agreed, \"but we'd be just as crazy to look this gift horse in the mouth. Let's get out before he changes his mind. We can debate it later - if we survive.\"</p><p>Keeping his vampet in front of him, as a shield, Vancha retreated. I followed, an arm wrapped around Steve, who was fully conscious now, but too groggy to make a break for freedom. Mr. Crepsley and Harkat came after us. The vampaneze and vampets watched us leave. Many of the red or red-rimmed eyes were filled with loathing and disgust - but none pursued us.</p><p>We backed up through the tunnel for a while, until we were certain we weren't being followed. Then we stopped and exchanged uncertain looks. I opened my mouth to say something, but Vancha silenced me before I spoke. \"Let's not waste time.\" Turning, he pushed his vampet ahead of him and began jogging. Harkat took off after him, shrugging helplessly at me as he passed. Mr. Crepsley pointed at me to go next, with Steve. Shoving Steve in front, I poked him in the back with the tip of my sword, and roughly encouraged him forward at a brisk pace.</p><p>Up through the long, dark tunnels we padded, the hunters and their prisoners, beaten, bloodied, bruised and bewildered. I thought about the Vampaneze Lord, the insane R.V. and his hapless prisoner - Debbie. It tore me up inside to leave her behind, but I had no choice. Later, if I lived, I'd return for her. Right now I had to think only of my own life. With a great effort, I thrust all thoughts of Debbie from my head and concentrated on the path ahead. At the back of my mind, unbidden, a clock formed, and with every footstep I could hear the hands ticking down the seconds, cutting away at our period of grace, bringing us relentlessly closer to the moment when Gannen Harst would set the vampaneze and vampets after us - freeing the hounds of hell.</p>",""]},{"title":"Killers of the Dawn","pages":["<p>Chapter ONE</p><p>IT WASan age of deceit. Everyone was suspicious of everyone else - and with good reason! You never knew when a trusted ally would turn, bare his fangs and rip you to pieces.</p><p>The vampires and vampaneze were at war the War of the Scars - and the result hinged upon finding and killing the Lord of the Vampaneze. If the vampires did that, victory would be theirs. Otherwise, the night would belong to their purple-skinned blood-cousins, who would drive the vampires to extinction.</p><p>Three vampires were sent by Mr Desmond Tiny to hunt the Vampaneze Lord - Vancha March, Larten Crepsley and me, Darren Shan. I'm a half-vampire.</p><p>Mr Tiny told us that other vampires couldn't assist us in our hunt, but non-vampires could. Thus, the only one to accompany us was a Little Person called Harkat Mulds, though a witch known as Lady Evanna also travelled with us for a short time during our quest.</p><p>After unwittingly letting the Vampaneze Lord slip through our fingers in the first of four predicted encounters, we travelled to the city of Mr Crepsley's birth. We didn't expect to find the Lord of the Vampaneze there - we came to track down and stop a gang of vampaneze who were murdering humans.</p><p>We attracted two more companions in the city - my ex-girlfriend, Debbie Hemlock, and Steve Leopard. Steve used to be my best friend. He said he'd become a vampaneze-hunter, and swore he'd help us put an end to the killer vampaneze. Mr Crepsley was suspicious of Steve - he believed Steve had evil blood - but I persuaded him to grant my old friend the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>Our target was an insane, hook-handed vampaneze. It turned out he was another of my ex-associates - R.V. , which originally stood for Reggie Veggie, though he now claimed it was short for Righteous Vampaneze. He was once an eco-warrior, until his hands had been bitten off by the Wolf Man at the Cirque Du Freak. He blamed me for the accident, and had teamed up with the vampaneze in order to exact revenge.</p><p>We could have killed R.V. , but we knew he was in league with other vampaneze, and we chose instead to trick him into leading us to them. What we didn't know was that we were actually the flies in the trap, not the spiders. Deep beneath the streets of the city, dozens of vampaneze were waiting for us. Among them stood the Lord of the Vampaneze and his protector, Gannen Harst - Vancha March's estranged brother.</p><p>In an underground cavern, Steve Leopard revealed his true colours. He was a half-vampaneze and had plotted with R.V. and the Vampaneze Lord to lure us to our doom. But Steve underestimated us, and I overcame him and would have killed him - except R.V. captured Debbie and threatened to murder her in retaliation.</p><p>While this was happening, my allies pursued the Vampaneze Lord, but the odds were stacked against them and he escaped. The vampaneze could have slaughtered us all, but we would have killed many of them in the process. To avoid the bloodshed, Gannen Harst let us go and gave us a fifteen-minute head start - it would be easier for the vampaneze to kill us in the tunnels.</p><p>With me holding Steve Leopard hostage, and Vancha clutching a vampet - a human who'd been trained in the ways of the vampaneze - we retreated, leaving R.V. free to do all the terrible things he wanted to Debbie. Through the tunnels we hurried, exhausted and distraught, knowing the vampaneze would soon swarm after us and cut us down dead if they caught up ?</p><p>Chapter ONE</p><p>WE SCURRIED through the tunnels, Mr Crepsley leading the way, Vancha and I in the middle with our prisoners, Harkat bringing up the rear. We said as little as possible, and I cuffed Steve into silence whenever he started to speak - I wasn't in the mood to listen to his threats or insults.</p><p>I didn't have a watch, but I'd been ticking off the seconds inside my head. About ten minutes or so had passed by my reckoning. We'd moved out of the modern tunnels and were back in the warren of old, damp tunnels. There was still a long way to go - plenty of time for the vampaneze to run us down.</p><p>We came to a junction and Mr Crepsley took the left turn. Vancha started to follow him, then stopped. \"Larten,\" he called him back. When Mr Crepsley returned, Vancha crouched low. He was almost invisible in the darkness of the tunnels. \"We have to try and shake them off,\" he said. \"If we make straight for the surface, they'll be upon us before we're halfway there.\"</p><p>\"But we could lose ourselves if we detour,\" Mr Crepsley said. \"We do not know this area. We might run into a dead end.\"</p><p>\"Aye,\" Vancha sighed, \"but it's a chance we'll have to take. I'll act as a decoy and go back the way we came. The rest of you try and find an alternative route out. I'll work my way back to you later, if the luck of the vampires is with me.\"</p><p>Mr Crepsley thought about that a moment, then nodded quickly. \"Luck, Sire,\" he said, but Vancha was already gone, disappearing into the gloom in an instant, moving with the almost perfect silence of the vampires.</p><p>We rested a moment, then took the right tunnel and pressed on, Harkat now in charge of the vampet Vancha had kidnapped. We moved quickly but carefully, trying not to leave any signs that we'd passed this way. At the end of the tunnel, we branched off, again to the right. As we entered a fresh stretch of tunnel, Steve coughed loudly. Mr Crepsley was on him in a flash. \"Do that again and you die!\" he snapped, and I sensed the blade of his knife pressing against Steve's throat.</p><p>\"It was a real cough - not a signal,\" Steve snarled in reply.</p><p>\"It matters not!\" Mr Crepsley hissed. \"The next time, I will kill you.\"</p><p>Steve was silent after that, as was the vampet. We marched steadily upwards, instinctively navigating the tunnels, wading through water and waste. I felt terrible, tired and drawn, but I didn't slow down. It must be daylight above ground, or very close to it. Our only hope was to get clear of the tunnels before the vampaneze found us - the sunlight should prevent them from pursuing us any further.</p><p>A short while later, we heard the vampaneze and vampets. They were coming up the tunnels at great speed, not having to worry about stealth. Mr Crepsley dropped back a bit, to check if they were following us, but they didn't seem to have found our trail - all of them appeared to have gone after Vancha.</p><p>We continued to climb, working our way closer to the surface. Our pursuers kept passing in and out of earshot. By the sounds they made, they'd realized we weren't following the shortest route back, and had stopped and fanned out in search of us. I guessed that we were at least half an hour from ground level. If they located us any time soon, we were certainly doomed. The tunnels were as tight as they were dark - a lone, well-placed vampet would have no difficulty mowing us down with a rifle or arrow-gun.</p>","<p>We were picking our way over a heap of rubble in a crumbling tunnel when we were eventually spotted. A vampet with a torch entered the tunnel at the far end, picked us out with a strong beam of light, and roared triumphantly. \"I've found them! They're here! They?\"</p><p>He got no further. A figure stepped out of the shadows behind him, grabbed his head and twisted sharply, left then right. The vampet dropped to the ground. His assailant paused just long enough to turn off the torch, then hurried over. I knew without having to see him that it was Vancha.</p><p>\"Good timing,\" Harkat muttered as the scraggly Prince joined us.</p><p>\"I've been shadowing you for a while,\" Vancha said. \"He's not the first one I've picked off. He just got a bit closer to you than the others.\"</p><p>\"Any idea how far we are from the surface?\" I asked.</p><p>\"No,\" Vancha said. \"I was ahead of you earlier, but I've been bringing up the rear for the last quarter of an hour, covering you and laying a few false trails.\"</p><p>\"What about the vampaneze?\" Mr Crepsley said. \"Are they close?\"</p><p>\"Aye,\" came Vancha's reply, and then he slipped away again, to provide more cover.</p><p>Slightly further ahead, we found ourselves in familiar tunnels. We'd explored a vast slice of the city's infrastructure when hunting for the vampaneze, and had been in this section three or four times. We were no more than six or seven minutes from safety. Mr Crepsley whistled loudly, signalling to Vancha. The Prince swiftly joined us and we pushed on vigorously, finding a new lease of life.</p><p>\"There they go!\"</p><p>The shout came from a tunnel to our left. We didn't stop to check how many were nearby - putting our heads down, we pushed Steve and the vampet in front and ran.</p><p>The vampaneze weren't long surging after us. Vancha dropped back and kept them at bay with his shurikens - sharp, multi-edged throwing stars which were lethal when thrown by one as experienced as Vancha March. By the hysterical voices, I knew most - if not all - of the vampaneze and vampets had now converged behind us, but the tunnel we were in ran straight ahead, with hardly any side-tunnels opening out of it. Our enemies weren't able to sneak around and attack us from the sides or in front - they were forced to follow behind.</p><p>As we got closer to street level, the tunnels grew brighter, and my half-vampire eyes quickly adjusted to the dim light. I was now able to see the vampaneze and vampets trailing behind - and they were able to see us! The vampaneze, like vampires, had sworn not to use any missile-firing weapons such as guns or bows, but the vampets weren't limited by that oath. They began firing as soon as they had a clear line of sight, and we had to run doubled-over. Ifwe'd had to cover a long distance in that uncomfortable crouch, they'd have surely picked us off one by one, but within a minute of them opening fire, we arrived at a steel ladder leading up to a manhole.</p><p>\"Go!\" Vancha barked, unleashing a hail of shurikens at the vampets.</p><p>Mr Crepsley grabbed me and shoved me up the ladder. I didn't protest at being first. It made the most sense - if the vampaneze pressed forward, Mr Crepsley was better equipped to fight them off.</p><p>At the top of the ladder I braced myself, then heaved against the manhole cover with my shoulders. It flew off, clearing the way up. I hauled myself out and quickly checked my surroundings. I was in the middle of a small street; it was early in the morning and nobody was about. Leaning back over the manhole, I yelled, \"It's clear!\"</p><p>Seconds later, Steve Leopard crawled out of the manhole, grimacing in the sunlight (almost blinding after being down the tunnels so long). Then Harkat came, followed by the vampet. There was a short delay after that. The tunnel underneath echoed with angry gun retorts. Fearing the worst, I was about to climb back down the ladder to check on Mr Crepsley and Vancha, when the orange-haired vampire burst out of the manhole, gasping wildly. Almost immediately, Vancha shot out after him. The pair must have jumped, one directly after the other.</p><p>As soon as Vancha was clear of the manhole, I stumbled across the street, picked up the cover, shuffled back with it and set it in place. Then all four of us gathered around it, Vancha grasping several shurikens, Mr Crepsley his knives, Harkat his axe, and me my sword. We waited ten seconds. Twenty. Half a minute. A minute passed. Mr Crepsley and Vancha were sweating stingingly beneath the wan glare of the morning sun.</p><p>Nobody came.</p><p>Vancha cocked an eyebrow at Mr Crepsley. \"Think they've given up?\"</p><p>\"For the moment,\" Mr Crepsley nodded, backing off warily, switching his attention to Steve and the vampet, making sure they didn't make a break for freedom.</p><p>\"We should get out of - this city,\" Harkat said, wiping a layer of dried blood from around his stitched-together grey face. Like Mr Crepsley and Vancha, he was nicked in many places after his battle with the vampaneze, but the cuts weren't serious. \"It would be suicide to remain.\"</p><p>\"Run, rabbits, run,\" Steve murmured, and I cuffed him around the ears again, shutting him up.</p><p>\"I'm not leaving Debbie,\" I said. \"R.V.'s a crazed killer. I'm not going to abandon her to him.\"</p><p>\"What did you do to that maniac to madden him so much?\" Vancha asked, peeking down one of the small holes in the manhole cover, still not entirely convinced that we were in the clear. The purple animal hides he dressed in were hanging from his frame in shreds, and his dyed green hair was flecked with blood.</p><p>\"Nothing,\" I sighed. \"There was an accident at the Cirque Du Freak. He?\"</p><p>\"We have no time for recollections,\" Mr Crepsley interrupted, tearing off the left sleeve of his red shirt, which had been slashed in as many places as Vancha's hides. He squinted up at the sun. \"In our state, we cannot bear to stay in the sun very long. Whatever our choice, we must choose soon.\"</p><p>\"Darren's right,\" Vancha said. \"We can't leave. Not because of Debbie - much as I like her, I wouldn't sacrifice myself for her - but the Lord of the Vampaneze. We know he's down there. We have to go after him.\"</p><p>\"But he's too well protected,\" Harkat protested. \"Those tunnels are full of vampaneze - and vampets. We'd perish for certain if we went - down again. I say we flee and come back - later, with help.\"</p><p>\"You've forgotten Mr Tiny's warning,\" Vancha said. \"We can't ask other vampires for help. I don't care how poor the odds are - we must try to breach their defences and kill their Lord.\"</p>","<p>\"I agree,\" Mr Crepsley said. \"But now is not the time. We are wounded and exhausted. We should rest and form a plan of action. The question is, where do we retire to - the apartments we have been using, or elsewhere?\"</p><p>\"Elsewhere,\" Harkat said instantly. \"The vampaneze know where - we've been living. If we stay, we'd be crazy to go where - they can attack any time they like.\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" I muttered. \"It was weird, the way they let us leave. I know Gannen said it was to spare the lives of his companions, but if they'd killed us, they were guaranteed victory in the War of the Scars. I think there's more to it than he was letting on. Having spared us when they had us trapped on their own turf, I doubt they'll come all the way up here to fight on our territory.\"</p><p>My companions mused on that in silence.</p><p>\"I think we should return to our base and try to make sense of this,\" I said. \"Even if we can't, we can get some rest and tend to our wounds. Then, come night, we'll attack.\"</p><p>\"Sounds good to me,\" Vancha said.</p><p>\"As good a plan as any,\" Mr Crepsley sighed.</p><p>\"Harkat?\" I asked the Little Person.</p><p>His round green eyes were full of doubt, but he grimaced and nodded. \"I think we're fools to stay, but if - we're going to, I guess at least we have weapons and - provisions there.\"</p><p>\"Besides,\" Vancha added grimly, \"most of the apartments are empty. It's quiet.\" He ran a menacing finger along the neck of his captured vampet, a shaven-headed man with the dark 'V' of the vampets tattooed above either ear. \"There are some questions I want answered, but the asking won't be pleasant. It'll be for the best if there's nobody around to hear.\"</p><p>The vampet sneered at Vancha as though unimpressed, but I could see fear in his blood-rimmed eyes. Vampaneze had the strength to withstand horrible torture, but vampets were human. A vampire could do terrible things to a human.</p><p>Mr Crepsley and Vancha wrapped their robes and hides around their heads and shoulders, to protect them from the worst of the sun. Then, pushing Steve and the vampet ahead of us, we climbed to roof level, got our bearings, and wearily headed for base.</p><p>Chapter TWO</p><p>\"BASE\" WASthe fifth floor of an ancient, largely abandoned block of apartments. It was where Steve had set up camp. We'd moved in when we teamed up with him. We occupied three apartments on the floor. While Mr Crepsley, Harkat and I bundled Steve into the middle apartment, Vancha grabbed the vampet by his ears and hauled him off to the apartment on the right.</p><p>\"Will he torture him?\" I asked Mr Crepsley, pausing at the door.</p><p>\"Yes,\" the vampire answered bluntly.</p><p>I didn't like the thought of that, but the circumstances called for swift, true answers. Vancha was only doing what had to be done. In war there's sometimes no room for compassion or humanity.</p><p>Entering our apartment, I hurried to the fridge. It didn't work - the apartment had no electricity - but we stored our drinks and food there.</p><p>\"Anyone hungry or thirsty?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I'll have asteak - extra bloody - fries and a Coke to go,\" Steve quipped. He'd made himself comfortable on the couch, and was smiling around at us as though we were one big happy family.</p><p>I ignored him. \"Mr Crepsley? Harkat?\"</p><p>\"Water, please,\" Mr Crepsley said, shrugging off his tattered red cloak, so he could examine his wounds. \"And bandages,\" he added.</p><p>\"Are you hurt?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"Not really. But the tunnels we crawled through were unhygienic. We should all clean out our wounds to prevent infection.\"</p><p>I washed my hands, then threw some food together. I wasn't hungry but I felt I should eat - my body was working solely on excess adrenaline; it needed feeding. Harkat and Mr Crepsley also tucked into the food and soon we were finishing off the last of the crumbs.</p><p>We offered none to Steve.</p><p>While we were tending to our wounds, I stared hatefully at Steve, who grinned back mockingly. \"How long did it take to set this up?\" I asked. \"Getting us here, arranging those false papers for me and sending me to school, luring us down the tunnels - how long?\"</p><p>\"Years,\" Steve replied proudly. \"It wasn't easy. You don't know the half of it. That cavern where the trap was set - we built that from scratch, along with the tunnels leading in and out of it. We built other caverns too. There's one I'm especially proud of. I hope I have the chance to show it to you some time.\"</p><p>\"You went to all this trouble just for us?\" Mr Crepsley asked, startled.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Steve replied smugly.</p><p>\"Why?\" I asked. \"Wouldn't it have been easier to fight us in the old, existing tunnels?\"</p><p>\"Easier,\" Steve agreed, \"but not as much fun. I've developed a love of the dramatic over the years - a bit like Mr Tiny. You should appreciate that, having worked for a circus for so long.\"</p><p>\"WhatI don't understand,\" Harkat mused, \"is what the - Vampaneze Lord was doing there, or why the other vampaneze - aided you in your insane plans.\"</p><p>\"Not as insane as you might think,\" Steve retorted. \"The Vampaneze Lord knew you'd be coming. Mr Tiny told him all about the hunters who would dog his footsteps. He also said that running away or hiding wasn't an option - if our Lord didn't make a stand and face those who hunted him, the War of the Scars would be lost.</p><p>\"When he learnt of my interest in you - and R.V.'s - he consulted us and together we hatched this plan. Gannen Harst cautioned against it - he's old school and would have preferred a direct confrontation - but the Vampaneze Lord shares my theatrical tastes.\"</p><p>\"This Lord of yours,\" Mr Crepsley said. \"What does he look like?\"</p><p>Steve laughed and shook a finger at the vampire. \"Now, now, Larten. You don't honestly expect me to describe him, do you? He's been very careful not to show his face, even to most of those who follow him.\"</p><p>\"We could torture it out of you,\" I growled.</p><p>\"I doubt it,\" Steve smirked. \"I'm half-vampaneze. I can take anything you can dish out. I'd let you kill me before I betrayed the clan.\" He shrugged off the heavy jacket he'd been wearing since we met. Strong chemical odours wafted off him.</p><p>\"He's not shivering any more,\" Harkat said suddenly. Steve had told us he suffered from colds, which was why he had to wear lots of clothes and smear on lotions to protect himself.</p>","<p>\"Of course not,\" Steve said. \"That was all for show.\"</p><p>\"You have the slyness of a demon,\" Mr Crepsley grunted. \"By claiming to be susceptible to colds, you were able to wear gloves to hide your fingertip scars, and douse yourself in sickly-smelling lotions to mask your vampaneze stench.\"</p><p>\"The smell was the difficult bit,\" Steve laughed. \"I knew your sensitive noses would sniff my blood out, so I had to distract them.\" He pulled a face. \"But it hasn't been easy. My sense of smell is also highly developed, so the fumes have played havoc with my sinuses. The headaches are awful.\"</p><p>\"My heart bleeds for you,\" I snarled sarcastically, and Steve laughed with delight. He was having a great time, even though he was our prisoner. His eyes were alight with evil glee.</p><p>\"You won't be grinning if R.V. refuses to trade Debbie for you,\" I told him.</p><p>\"True enough,\" he admitted. \"But I live only to see you and Creepy Crepsley suffer. I could die happy knowing the torment you'll endure if R.V. carves up your darling teacher girlfriend.\"</p><p>I shook my head, appalled. \"How did you get so twisted?\" I asked. \"We were friends, almost like brothers. You weren't evil then. What happened to you?\"</p><p>Steve's face darkened. \"I was betrayed,\" he said quietly.</p><p>\"That isn't true,\" I replied. \"I saved your life. I gave up everything so that you could live. I didn't want to become a half-vampire. I?\"</p><p>\"Shut it!\" Steve snapped. \"Torture me if you wish, but don't insult me with lies. I know you plotted with Creepy Crepsley to spite me. I could have been a vampire, powerful, long-living, majestic. But you left me as a human, to shuffle through a pitifully short life, weak and afraid like everybody else. Well, guess what? I outsmarted you! I tracked down those in the other camp and gained my rightful powers and privileges anyway!\"</p><p>\"For all the good it has done you,\" Mr Crepsley snorted.</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" Steve snapped.</p><p>\"You have wasted your life on hatred and revenge,\" Mr Crepsley said. \"What good is life if there is no joy or creative purpose? You would have been better off living five years as a human than five hundred as a monster.\"</p><p>\"I'm no monster!\" Steve snarled. \"I'm ?\" He stopped and growled something to himself. \"Enough of this crap,\" he declared aloud. \"You're boring me. If you haven't anything more intelligent to say, keep your mouths shut.\"</p><p>\"Impudent cur!\" Mr Crepsley roared, and swung the back of his hand across Steve's cheek, drawing blood. Steve sneered at the vampire, wiped the blood off with his fingers, then put them to his lips.</p><p>\"One night soon, it'll beyour blood I dine on,\" he whispered, then lapsed into silence.</p><p>Exasperated and weary, Mr Crepsley, Harkat and I also fell silent. We finished cleaning our wounds, then lay back and relaxed. If we'd been alone, we'd have dozed off - but none of us dared shut our eyes with a destructive beast like Steve Leopard in the room.</p><p>More than an hour after Vancha had taken his captive vampet aside, he returned. His face was dark and although he'd washed his hands before coming in, he hadn't been able to remove all the traces of blood. Some of it was his own, from wounds received in the tunnels, but most had come from the vampet.</p><p>Vancha found a bottle of warm beer in the out-of-order fridge, yanked the top off and downed it hungrily. He normally never drank anything other than fresh water, milk and blood - but these were hardly normal times.</p><p>He wiped around his mouth with the back of a hand when he was done, then stared at the faint red stains on his flesh. \"He was a brave man,\" Vancha said quietly. \"He resisted longer than I thought possible. I had to do bad things to make him talk. I ?\" He shivered and opened another bottle. There were bitter tears in his eyes as he drank.</p><p>\"Is he dead?\" I asked, my voice trembling.</p><p>Vancha sighed and looked away. \"We're at war. We cannot afford to spare our enemies' lives. Besides, by the time I'd finished, it seemed cruel to let him live. Killing him was a mercy in the end.\"</p><p>\"Praise the gods of the vampires for small mercies,\" Steve laughed, then flinched as Vancha spun, drew a shuriken and sent it flying at him. The sharp throwing star buried itself in the material of the couch, less than a centimetre beneath Steve's right ear.</p><p>\"I won't miss with the next,\" Vancha swore, and at last the smile slipped from Steve's face, as he realized how serious the Prince was.</p><p>Mr Crepsley got up and laid a calming hand on Vancha's shoulder, directing him to a chair. \"Was the interrogation worthwhile?\" he asked. \"Had the vampet anything new to reveal?\"</p><p>Vancha didn't answer immediately. He was still glaring at Steve. Then the question sunk in and he wiped around his large eyes with the ends of one of his animal hides. \"He'd plenty to say,\" Vancha grunted, then lapsed into silence and stared down at the bottle of beer in his hands, as though he didn't know how it got there.</p><p>\"The vampet!\" he said loudly after a minute of quiet, head snapping up, eyes clicking into focus. \"Yes. I found out, for starters, why Gannen didn't kill us, and why the others fought so cagily.\" Leaning forward, he lobbed the empty beer bottle at Steve, who swatted it aside, then stared arrogantly back at the Prince. \"Only the Vampaneze Lord can kill us,\" Vancha said softly.</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I frowned.</p><p>\"He's bound by Mr Tiny's rules, the same as us,\" Vancha explained. \"Just aswe can't call upon others for help in tracking and fighting him,he can't ask his underlings to kill us. Mr Tiny said he had to kill us himself to ensure victory. He can call upon all the vampaneze he likes to fight us, but if one should strike too deeply and inflict a fatal wound, they're destined to lose the war.\"</p><p>That was exciting news and we discussed it eagerly. Until now, we thought we stood no chance against the Vampaneze Lord's minions - there were simply too many of them for us to cut a path through. But if they weren't allowed to kill us ?</p><p>\"Let's not get carried away,\" Harkat cautioned. \"Even if they can't kill us, they can - stall and subdue us. If they capture us and give us to - their Lord, it will be a simple matter for him to - drive a stake through our hearts.\"</p><p>\"How come they didn't killyou !\" I asked Harkat. \"You're not one of the three hunters.\"</p>","<p>\"Maybe they don't know that,\" Harkat said.</p><p>Steve muttered something beneath his breath.</p><p>\"What was that?\" Vancha shouted, prodding him sharply with his left foot.</p><p>\"I said we didn't know before, but we do now!\" Steve jeered. \"At least,\" he added sulkily, \"Iknow.\"</p><p>\"You did not know who the hunters were?\" Mr Crepsley asked.</p><p>Steve shook his head. \"We knew there were three of you, and Mr Tiny told us that one would be a child, so we had Darren pegged straight off. But when five of you turned up - you three, Harkat and Debbie - we weren't sure about the others. We guessed the hunters would be vampires, but we didn't want to take unnecessary chances.\"</p><p>\"Is that why you pretended to be our ally?\" I asked. \"You wanted to get close to us, to figure out who the hunters were?\"</p><p>\"That was part of it,\" Steve nodded, \"although mostly I just wanted to toy with you. It was fun, getting so close that I could kill you whenever I wished, delaying the fatal blow until the time was right.\"</p><p>\"He's a fool,\" Vancha snorted. \"Anyone who wouldn't strike his foe dead at the first opportunity is asking for trouble.\"</p><p>\"Steve Leonard is many things,\" Mr Crepsley said, \"but not foolish.\" He rubbed the long scar on the left side of his face, thinking deeply. \"You thought this plan through most thoroughly, did you not?\" he asked Steve.</p><p>\"I sure did,\" Steve smirked.</p><p>\"You accounted for every possible twist and turn?\"</p><p>\"As many as I could imagine.\"</p><p>Mr Crepsley stopped stroking his scar and his eyes narrowed. \"Then you must have considered what would happen if we escaped.\"</p><p>Steve's smile widened but he said nothing.</p><p>\"What was the back-up plan?\" Mr Crepsley asked, his voice strained.</p><p>'\"Back-up plan'?\" Steve echoed innocently.</p><p>\"Do not play games with me!\" Mr Crepsley hissed. \"You must have discussed alternate plans with R.V. and Gannen Harst. Once you had revealed your location to us, you could not afford to sit back and wait. Time is precious now that we know where your Lord is hiding, and how those with him cannot take our lives.\"</p><p>Mr Crepsley stopped speaking and snapped to his feet. Vancha was only a second behind him. Their eyes locked and, as one, they exclaimed, \"A trap!\"</p><p>\"I knew he came too quietly up the tunnels,\" Vancha growled, hurrying to the apartment door, opening it and checking the corridor outside. \"Deserted.\"</p><p>\"I will try the window,\" Mr Crepsley said, starting towards it.</p><p>\"No point,\" Vancha said. \"Vampaneze wouldn't attack in the open by day.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Mr Crepsley agreed, \"but vampets would.\" He reached the window and drew back the heavy blind which was blocking the harmful rays of the sun. His breath caught in his throat. \"Charna's guts!\" he gasped.</p><p>Vancha, Harkat and I rushed over to see what had upset him (Vancha grabbed hold of Steve on the way). What we saw caused us all to curse, except Steve, who laughed deliriously.</p><p>The street outside was teeming with police cars, army vans, policemen and soldiers. They were lined up in front of the building, and stretched around the sides. Many carried rifles. In the building opposite, we glimpsed figures in the windows, also armed. As we watched, a helicopter buzzed down from overhead and hung in the air a couple of floors above us. There was a soldier in the helicopter with a rifle so big it could have been used to shoot elephants.</p><p>But the marksman wasn't interested in elephants. He was aiming at the same target as those in the building and on the ground ?us !</p><p>Chapter THREE</p><p>AS Astrong spotlight was trained on the window to dazzle us, we all turned to one side and let the blind fall back into place. Retreating, Vancha cursed at his loudest and vilest, while the rest of us glanced uneasily at one another, waiting for someone to propose a plan.</p><p>\"How did they sneak up without - us hearing?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"We weren't paying attention to what was happening outside,\" I said.</p><p>\"Even so,\" Harkat insisted, \"we should have - picked up on the sirens.\"</p><p>\"They didn't use sirens,\" Steve laughed. \"They were warned to tread quietly. And, before you waste time checking, they've got the rear of the building and roof covered as well as the front.\" As we stared at him questioningly, he said, \"I wasn't distracted.I heard them coming.\"</p><p>Vancha bellowed madly at Steve, then made a dive for him. Mr Crepsley stepped into his path to reason with him, but Vancha shoved him aside without regard and charged towards Steve, murder in his eyes.</p><p>A voice from outside, amplified by a megaphone, stopped him.</p><p>\"You in there!\" it bellowed. \"Killers!\"</p><p>Vancha hesitated, fingers balled into fists, then pointed at Steve and snarled, \"Later!\" Spinning, he hurried to the window and nudged the blind aside a fraction. Light from the sun and spotlight flooded the room.</p><p>Letting the blind fall back into place, Vancha roared, \"Turn off the light!\"</p><p>\"No chance!\" the person with the megaphone laughed in reply.</p><p>Vancha stood there a moment, thinking, then nodded at Mr Crepsley and Harkat. \"Check the corridors above and below. Find out if they're inside the building. Don't clash with them - if that lot outside start firing, they'll cut us to ribbons.\"</p><p>Mr Crepsley and Harkat obeyed without question.</p><p>\"Bring that sorry excuse for a dog over here,\" Vancha said to me, and I dragged Steve to the window. Vancha wrapped a hand around Steve's throat and growled in his ear, \"Why are they here?\"</p><p>\"They think you're the killers,\" Steve chuckled. \"The ones who killed all those humans.\"</p><p>\"You son of a mongrel!\" Vancha snarled.</p><p>\"Please,\" Steve replied smugly. \"Let's not get personal.\"</p><p>Mr Crepsley and Harkat returned.</p><p>\"They're packed tight two floors - above,\" Harkat reported.</p><p>\"The same two floors below,\" Mr Crepsley said grimly.</p><p>Vancha cursed again, then thought quickly. \"We'll break through the floorboards,\" he decided. \"The humans will be in the halls. They won't expect us to go straight down through the apartments.\"</p><p>\"Yes they will,\" Steve disagreed. \"They've been warned to fill every room below, above and adjoining.\"</p>","<p>Vancha stared at Steve, looking for the slightest hint of a bluff. When he found none, his features softened and the ghostly traces of defeat welled in his eyes. Then he shook his head and put self-pity behind him.</p><p>\"We have to talk to them,\" he said. \"Find out where we stand and maybe buy some time to think this through. Anyone want to volunteer?\" When nobody replied, he grunted. \"Guess that means I'm the negotiator. Just don't blame me if it all goes wrong.\" Leaving the blind over the window, he smashed a pane of glass, then leant close and shouted at the humans below. \"Who's down there and what the hell do you want?\"</p><p>There was a pause, then the same voice as before spoke to us via a megaphone. \"Who am I talking to?\" the person asked. Now that I concentrated on the voice, I realized it was a woman's.</p><p>\"None of your business!\" Vancha roared.</p><p>Another pause. Then, \"We know your names. Larten Crepsley, Vancha March, Darren Shan and Harkat Mulds. I just want to know which one of you I'm in contact with.\"</p><p>Vancha's jaw dropped.</p><p>Steve doubled over with laughter.</p><p>\"Tell them who you are,\" Harkat whispered. \"They know too much. Best to act like we're - co-operating.\"</p><p>Vancha nodded, then shouted through the covered hole in the window, \"Vancha March.\"</p><p>As he did that, I peeked through a gap at the side of the blind, looking for weak points in the defences below. I didn't find any, but I did get a fix on the woman who was speaking to us - tall and broad, with short white hair.</p><p>\"Listen, March,\" the woman called as I stepped away from the window. \"I'm Chief Inspector Alice Burgess. I'm running this freak show.\" An ironic choice of words, though none of us commented on it. \"If you want to negotiate a deal, you'll be negotiating with me. One warning - I'm not here to play games. I've more than two hundred men and women out here and inside your building, just dying to put a round of bullets through your black excuse for a heart. At the first sign that you're messing with us, I'll give the order and they'll open fire. Understand?\"</p><p>Vancha bared his teeth and snarled, \"I understand.\" Then he repeated it, louder, so she could hear. \"I understand!\"</p><p>\"Good,\" Chief Inspector Burgess responded. \"First of all - are your hostages alive and unharmed?\"</p><p>'\"Hostages'?\" Vancha replied.</p><p>\"Steve Leonard and Mark Ryter. We know you have them, so don't act the innocent.\"</p><p>\"Mark Ryter must have been the vampet,\" I remarked.</p><p>\"You're soooooo observant,\" Steve laughed, then pushed Vancha aside and put his face up close to the window. \"This is Steve Leonard!\" he yelled, mimicking terror. \"They haven't killed me yet, but they killed Mark. They tortured him first. It was horrible. They?\"</p><p>He stopped, as though we'd cut him off mid-sentence, and stepped back, taking a self-indulgent bow.</p><p>\"Sons of ?\" the officer cursed over the megaphone, then collected her wits and addressed us calmly and dryly. \"OK - this is how it works. Release your remaining hostage. When he's safely in our custody, come down after him, one at a time. Any sign of a weapon, or any unexpected moves, and you're history.\"</p><p>\"Let's talk about this,\" Vancha shouted.</p><p>\"No talking,\" Burgess snapped.</p><p>\"We're not going to release him,\" Vancha roared. \"You don't know what he is, what he's done. Let me?\"</p><p>A rifle fired and a volley of bullets tore up the outside of the building. We fell to the floor, cursing and yelping, although there was no cause for concern - the marksmen were aiming deliberately high.</p><p>When the scream of bullets died away, the Chief Inspector addressed us again. \"That was a warning - your last. Next time we shoot to kill. No bargaining. No trade-offs. No talking. You've terrorized this city for most of a year, but it stops here. You're through.</p><p>\"Two minutes,\" she said. \"Then we come in after you.\"</p><p>A troubled silence descended.</p><p>\"That's that,\" Harkat muttered after a handful of slow-ticking seconds. \"We're finished.\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\" Vancha sighed. Then his gaze fell on Steve and he grinned. \"But we won't die alone.\"</p><p>Vancha brought the fingers of his right hand together and held them out straight so they formed a blade of flesh and bone. He raised the hand above his head like a knife and advanced.</p><p>Steve closed his eyes and waited for death with a smile on his face.</p><p>\"Wait,\" Mr Crepsley said softly, halting him. \"There is a way out.\"</p><p>Vancha paused. \"How?\" he asked suspiciously.</p><p>\"The window,\" Mr Crepsley said. \"We jump. They will not expect that.\"</p><p>Vancha considered the plan. \"The drop's no problem,\" he mused. \"Not for us, anyway. How about you, Harkat?\"</p><p>\"Five storeys?\" Harkat smiled. \"I could do that - in my sleep.\"</p><p>\"But what do we do once down there?\" Vancha asked. \"The place is crawling with police and soldiers.\"</p><p>\"We flit,\" Mr Crepsley said. \"I will carry Darren. You carry Harkat. It will not be easy - they might shoot us before we can work up to flitting speed - but it can be done. With luck.\"</p><p>\"It's crazy,\" Vancha growled, then winked at us. \"I like it!\" He pointed at Steve. \"But we kill him before we leave.\"</p><p>\"One minute!\" Alice Burgess shouted through her megaphone.</p><p>Steve hadn't moved. His eyes were still closed. He was still smiling.</p><p>I didn't want Vancha to kill Steve. Although he'd betrayed us, he'd been my friend once, and the thought of him being killed in cold blood disturbed me. Also, there was Debbie to think about - if we killed Steve, R.V. would certainly kill Debbie in retaliation. It was crazy to worry about her, considering the trouble we were in, but I couldn't helpit .</p><p>I was about to ask Vancha to spare Steve's life - although I didn't think he'd listen to me - when Mr Crepsley beat me to the punch.</p><p>\"We cannot kill him,\" he said, sounding disgusted.</p><p>\"Come again?\" Vancha blinked.</p><p>\"It is not the end of the world if we are captured,\" Mr Crepsley said.</p><p>\"Thirty seconds!\" Burgess screamed tensely.</p><p>Mr Crepsley ignored the interruption. \"If we are captured and taken alive, there may be chances to escape later. But if we kill Steve Leonard, I do not think they will spare us. These humans are ready to butcher us at the drop of a pin.\"</p>","<p>Vancha shook his head uncertainly. \"I don't like it. I'd rather kill him and take our chances.\"</p><p>\"I would too,\" Mr Crepsley agreed. \"But there is the Vampaneze Lord to consider. We must put the hunt before our personal wishes. Sparing Steve Leonard is?\"</p><p>\"Ten seconds.\" Burgess bellowed.</p><p>Vancha glowered over Steve a few seconds more, undecided, then cursed, twisted his hand, and whacked him over the back of the head with the flat of his palm. Steve toppled to the floor. I thought Vancha had killed him, but the Prince had only knocked him out.</p><p>\"That should shut him up for a while,\" Vancha grunted, checking his shuriken belts and wrapping his animal hides tight around him. \"If we get the chance later, we'll track him down and finish him off.\"</p><p>\"Time's up!\" Alice Burgess warned us. \"Come out immediately or we open fire!\"</p><p>\"Ready?\" Vancha asked.</p><p>\"Ready,\" Mr Crepsley said, drawing his knives.</p><p>\"Ready,\" Harkat said, testing the head of his axe with a large, grey finger.</p><p>\"Ready,\" I said, taking out my sword and holding it across my chest.</p><p>\"Harkat jumps with me,\" Vancha said. \"Larten and Darren - you come next. Give us a second or two to roll out of your way.\"</p><p>\"Luck, Vancha,\" Mr Crepsley said.</p><p>\"Luck,\" Vancha replied, then grinned savagely, slapped Harkat on the back, and leapt through the window, shattering the blind and glass, Harkat not far behind.</p><p>Mr Crepsley and I waited the agreed seconds, then jumped through the jagged remains of the window after our friends, and dropped swiftly to the ground like a couple of wingless bats, into the hellish cauldron which awaited us below.</p><p>Chapter FOUR</p><p>AS THEground rushed up to meet me, I brought my legs together, hunched my upper body, spread my hands and landed in a crouch. My extra-strong bones absorbed the shock without breaking, although the force of the contact sent me rolling forward and I almost impaled myself on my sword (which would have been an embarrassing way to die).</p><p>There was a sharp yell of pain to my left, and as I bounced on to my feet I saw Mr Crepsley lying on the ground, nursing his right ankle, unable to stand. Ignoring my injured friend, I brought up my sword defensively and looked for Vancha and Harkat.</p><p>Our leap through the window had taken the police and soldiers by surprise. They were falling over one another and getting in each other's way, making it impossible for anyone to take a clean shot.</p><p>Harkat had grabbed a young soldier in the midst of the confusion and was holding him close to his chest, spinning quickly in circles so nobody had time to shoot him in the back. Vancha, meanwhile, had set his sights on the big cheese. As I watched, he charged through several officers and soldiers, leapt over a car, and brought Chief Inspector Alice Burgess crashing to the ground with a perfectly timed tackle.</p><p>While all human eyes fixed on Vancha and the Chief Inspector, I hurried to Mr Crepsley's side and helped him up. His teeth were gritted in pain and I could tell instantly that his ankle wouldn't support him.</p><p>\"Is it broken?\" I shouted, dragging him behind a car for cover before someone snapped to his senses and took a shot at us.</p><p>\"I do not think so,\" he gasped, \"but the pain is intense.\" He collapsed behind the car and rubbed the flesh around his ankle, trying to massage out the pain.</p><p>Across the way, Vancha was on his feet, Alice Burgess' throat clutched in one hand, her megaphone in the other. \"Hear this!\" he roared through the megaphone at the police and soldiers. \"If you shoot, your Chief dies!\"</p><p>Above us, the blades of the helicopter hummed like the wings of a thousand angry bees. Otherwise - total silence.</p><p>Burgess broke it. \"Forget about me!\" she roared. \"Take these creeps out now!\"</p><p>Several marksmen raised their weapons obediently.</p><p>Vancha tightened his fingers around the police chief's throat. Her eyes bulged worryingly. The marksmen hesitated, then lowered their weapons slightly. Vancha loosened his grip, but didn't let go completely. Holding the white-haired woman in front of him, he shuffled over to where Harkat was standing with his human shield. The two got back to back, then slowly crossed to where Mr Crepsley and I were sheltering. They resembled a large and clumsy crab as they moved, but it worked. Nobody fired.</p><p>\"How bad is it?\" Vancha asked, crouching beside us, dragging Burgess down with him. Harkat did likewise with his soldier.</p><p>\"Bad,\" Mr Crepsley said soberly, locking gazes with Vancha.</p><p>\"You can't flit?\" Vancha asked softly.</p><p>\"Not like this.\"</p><p>They stared at each other silently.</p><p>\"Then we'll have to leave you behind,\" Vancha said.</p><p>\"Aye.\" Mr Crepsley smiled thinly.</p><p>\"I'm staying with him,\" I said instantly.</p><p>\"This is no time for false heroics,\" Vancha growled. \"You're coming - end of story.\"</p><p>I shook my head. \"The hell with false heroics - I'm being practical. You can't flit with both me and Harkat on your back. It would take too long to work up the speed. We'd be shot dead before we got to the end of the street.\"</p><p>Vancha opened his mouth to object, realized my argument was valid, and closed it.</p><p>\"I'm staying too,\" Harkat said.</p><p>Vancha groaned. \"We don't have time for this rubbish!\"</p><p>\"It's not rubbish,\" Harkat said calmly. \"I travel with Darren. Where he goes, I go. Where he stays, I stay. Besides, you'll stand a better chance - without me.\"</p><p>\"How do you figure that?\" Vancha asked.</p><p>Harkat pointed at Alice Burgess, still gasping from the tightness of Vancha's grip. \"Alone, you can carry her and use her as a - shield until you flit.\"</p><p>Vancha sighed downheartedly. \"You're all too clever for me. I'm not going to sit here and try to talk you round.\" He stuck his head up over the bonnet of the car to check on the surrounding troops, squinting hard against the daylight. \"Stay back,\" he warned, \"or these two die!\"</p><p>\"You'll - never get - away,\" Burgess croaked, her pale blue eyes filled with hate, her ghostly white skin flushed a deep, angry red. \"The first - clear shot they have - they'll take you out!\"</p><p>\"Then we'll have to make sure we don't give them one,\" Vancha laughed, covering her mouth with a hand before she could reply. His smile faded. \"I can't come back for you,\" he said to us. \"If you stay, you're on your own.\"</p>","<p>\"We know,\" Mr Crepsley said.</p><p>Vancha glanced up at the sun. \"You'd better surrender straightaway and pray to the gods that they bundle you into a cell without windows.\"</p><p>\"Aye.\" Mr Crepsley's teeth were chattering, partly from the pain in his ankle, partly from fear of the deadly rays of the sun.</p><p>Leaning forward, Vancha whispered so that Burgess and the soldier couldn't hear. \"If I escape, I'll return for the Vampaneze Lord. I'll wait in the cavern where we fought last night. I'll give you until midnight. If you aren't there by then, I'll go after him alone.\"</p><p>Mr Crepsley nodded. \"We will do our best to break out. If I cannot walk, Darren and Harkat will escape without me.\" He stared searchingly at us. \"Yes?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Harkat said.</p><p>I stared back silently a moment longer, then dropped my gaze. \"Yes,\" I muttered reluctantly.</p><p>Vancha grunted, then stuck out his free hand. We all joined a hand to his. \"Luck,\" he said, and each of us repeated it in turn.</p><p>Then, without waiting, Vancha stood and walked away, Burgess held stiffly in front of him. He'd dropped the megaphone on his way over. Now he stopped to pick it up and address the troops again. \"I'm making a break for it!\" he bellowed pleasantly. \"I know it's your job to stop me, but if you fire, your boss dies too. If you're wise, you'll wait for me to make an error. After all,\" he chuckled, \"you've got cars and helicopters. I'm on foot. I'm sure you can keep pace with me until the time's right to pounce.\"</p><p>Tossing aside the megaphone, Vancha lifted the Chief Inspector off the ground, held her in front of him like a doll, and ran.</p><p>A senior officer darted for the megaphone, snatched it up and issued orders. \"Hold your fire!\" he shouted. \"Don't break ranks. Wait for him to stumble or drop her. He can't escape. Train your sights on him, wait for a clean shot, then let him have it in the?\"</p><p>He stopped abruptly. He'd been watching Vancha race towards a blockade at the end of the street as he was talking, but in the blink of an eye the vampire had disappeared. Vancha had hit flitting speed, and to the humans it seemed as if he'd simply vanished into thin air.</p><p>As the police and soldiers crowded forward in disbelief, guns cocked, staring at the ground as though they thought Vancha and their Chief had sunk into it, Mr Crepsley, Harkat and I grinned at each other.</p><p>\"At least one of us is in the clear,\" Mr Crepsley said.</p><p>\"We would have been too, if you weren't such a clumsy ox,\" I grunted.</p><p>Mr Crepsley glanced up at the sun and his smile slipped. \"If they leave me in a cell which is open to the sun,\" he said quietly, \"I will not wait to burn to death. I will escape or die trying.\"</p><p>I nodded grimly. \"We all will.\"</p><p>Harkat pulled his soldier around so that he was facing us. The young man's face was green with terror and he was incapable of speech.</p><p>\"Do we leave him or - try to use him as a bargaining chip?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"Leave him,\" I said. \"They're less likely to shoot if we give ourselves up freely. If we try bargaining now, after Vancha has escaped with their boss, I think they'll mow us down.\"</p><p>\"We must leave our weapons too,\" Mr Crepsley said, laying his knives aside.</p><p>I didn't want to part with my sword, but common sense prevailed and I left it in a heap with Mr Crepsley's knives, Harkat's axe, and the other bits and pieces we'd been carrying. Then we rolled up the arms of our sleeves, raised our hands above our heads, shouted that we were surrendering, and walked out - Mr Crepsley hopping on one leg - to be arrested and imprisoned by the dark-faced, trigger-itchy officers of the law, who handcuffed us, cursed us, bundled us into vans and drove us away - to prison.</p><p>Chapter FIVE</p><p>IWASin a cell no more than four metres by four, with a ceding maybe three metres high. There were no windows - apart from a small one set in the door - and no two-way mirrors. There were two surveillance cameras in the corners above the door, a long table with a tape recorder on it, three chairs, me - and three grim-looking police officers.</p><p>One of the officers was standing by the door, a rifle cradled tightly across his chest, eyes sharp. He hadn't told me his name - he hadn't spoken a word - but I could read it from his badge: William McKay.</p><p>The other two weren't wearing badges, but had told me their names: Con and Ivan. Con was tall, dark-faced and very lean, with a gruff manner and ready sneer. Ivan was older and thinner, with grey hair. He looked tired and spoke softly, as though the questions were exhausting him.</p><p>\"Is Darren Shan your real name, like we've been told?\" Ivan enquired for about the twentieth time since I'd been admitted to the holding cell. They'd been asking the same questions over and over, and showed no signs of letting up.</p><p>I didn't answer. So far I hadn't said anything.</p><p>\"Or is it Darren Horston - the name you've been using recently?\" Ivan asked after a few seconds of silence.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\"How about your travelling companion - Larten Crepsley or Vur Horston?\"</p><p>I looked down at my hands, which were handcuffed, and said nothing. I examined the chain linking the handcuffs: steel, short, thick. I thought I'd be able to snap it if I had to, but I wasn't sure.</p><p>My ankles were cuffed as well. The chain linking my ankles had been short when I was arrested. The police left the short chain on while I was being fingerprinted and photographed, but took it off and replaced it with a longer chain soon after they locked me away securely in the cell.</p><p>\"What about the freak?\" the officer called Con asked. \"That grey-skinned monster. What's?\"</p><p>\"He isn't a monster!\" I snapped, breaking my code of silence.</p><p>\"Oh?\" Con sneered. \"What is he then?\"</p><p>I shook my head. \"You wouldn't believe me if I told you.\"</p><p>\"Try us,\" Ivan encouraged me, but I only shook my head again.</p><p>\"What about the other two?\" Con asked. \"Vancha March and Larten Crepsley. Our informants told us they were vampires. What do you have to say about that?\"</p><p>I smiled humourlessly. \"Vampires don't exist,\" I said. \"Everyone knows that.\"</p><p>\"That's right,\" Ivan said. \"They don't.\" He leant across the table, as though to tell me a secret. \"But those two aren't entirely normal, Darren, as I'm sure you already know. March disappeared like a magician, while Crepsley ?\" He coughed. \"Well, we haven't been able to photograph him.\"</p>","<p>I smiled when he said that, and looked up at the video cameras. Full-vampires have peculiar atoms, which make it impossible for them to be captured on film. The police could take snaps of Mr Crepsley from every angle they could dream of, with the best cameras available - to no visible effect.</p><p>\"Look at the grin on him!\" Con snapped. \"He thinks this is funny!\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said, wiping the smile from my face. \"I don't.\"</p><p>\"Then why are you laughing?\"</p><p>I shrugged. \"I was thinking of something else.\"</p><p>Ivan slumped back in his chair, disappointed by my answers. \"We've taken a blood sample from Crepsley,\" he said. \"From the thing called Harkat Mulds too. We'll find out what they are when the results come back. It would be to your advantage to tell us now.\"</p><p>I didn't reply. Ivan waited a moment, then ran a hand through his grey hair. He sighed despondently, and began with the questions again. \"What's your real name? What's your relationship to the others? Where ?\"</p><p>More time passed. I wasn't able to judge exactly how long I'd been imprisoned. It felt like a day or more, but realistically it was probably only four or five hours, maybe less. The sun was most likely still shining outside.</p><p>I thought about Mr Crepsley and wondered how he was faring. If he was in a cell like mine, he'd nothing to worry about. But if they'd put him in a cell with windows ?</p><p>\"Where are my friends?\" I asked.</p><p>Con and Ivan had been discussing something under their breath. Now they looked at me, expressions guarded.</p><p>\"You'd like to see them?\" Ivan asked.</p><p>\"I just want to know where they are,\" I said.</p><p>\"If you answer our questions, a meeting can be arranged,\" Ivan promised.</p><p>\"I just want to know where they are,\" I repeated.</p><p>\"They're close,\" Con grunted. \"Locked away nice and tight like you.\"</p><p>\"In cells like this?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Exactly the same,\" Con said, then looked around at the walls and smiled as he realized why I was concerned. \"Cells without windows,\" he chuckled, then nudged his partner in the ribs. \"But that can be changed, can't it, Ivan? What say we move the 'vampire' to a cell with lovely round windows? A cell with a view of the outside - the sky - thesun .\"</p><p>I said nothing, but locked gazes with Con and stared back angrily.</p><p>\"You don't like the sound of that, do you?\" Con hissed. \"The thought of us sticking Crepsley in a room with windows terrifies you, doesn't it?\"</p><p>I shrugged indifferently and averted my eyes. \"I want to speak to a lawyer,\" I said.</p><p>Con burst out laughing. Ivan hid a smile behind a hand. Even the guard with the rifle smirked, as though I'd cracked the best joke ever.</p><p>\"What's so funny?\" I snapped. \"I know my rights. I'm entitled to a phonecall and a lawyer.\"</p><p>\"Of course,\" Con crowed. \"Even killers have rights.\" He rapped the table with his knuckles, then turned off the tape recorder. \"But guess what - we're withholding those rights. We'll catch hell for it later, but we don't care. We've got you walled up here and we won't let you take advantage of your rights until you give with some answers.\"</p><p>\"That's illegal,\" I growled. \"You can't do that.\"</p><p>\"Normally, no,\" he agreed. \"Normally our Chief Inspector would barge in and kick up a storm if she heard about something like this. But our Chief isn't here, is she? She's been abducted by your fellow killer, Vancha March.\"</p><p>I went white-lipped when I heard that and realized what it meant. With their Chief out of the way, they'd taken the law into their own hands, and were prepared to do whatever it took to find out where she was and get her back. It might cost their them careers, but they didn't care. This was personal.</p><p>\"You'll have to torture me to make me talk,\" I said stiffly, testing them to see how far they were willing to go.</p><p>\"Torture's not our way,\" Ivan said immediately. \"We don't do things like that.\"</p><p>\"Unlike some people we could mention,\" Con added, then tossed a photo across the table at me. I tried to ignore it, but my eyes flicked automatically to the figure in it. I saw that it was the vampet we'd taken hostage earlier that morning in the tunnels, the one called Mark Ryter - the one Vancha had tortured and killed.</p><p>\"We're not evil,\" I said quietly. But I could see things from their point of view and understood how monstrous we must look. \"There are sides to this you don't know about. We're not the killers you seek. We're trying to stop them, the same as you.\"</p><p>Con barked a laugh.</p><p>\"It's true,\" I insisted. \"Mark Ryter was one of the bad guys. We had to hurt him to find out about the others. We're not your enemies. You and I are on the same side.\"</p><p>\"That's the weakest lie I've ever heard,\" Con snapped. \"How dumb do you think we are?\"</p><p>\"I don't think you're dumb at all,\" I said. \"But you're misguided. You've been tricked. You ?\" I leant forward eagerly. \"Who told you where to find us? Who told you our names, that we were vampires, that we were your killers?\"</p><p>The policemen shared an uneasy glance, then Ivan said, \"It was an anonymous tip-off. The caller rang from a public phone booth, left no name, and was gone when we arrived.\"</p><p>\"Doesn't that sound fishy to you?\" I asked.</p><p>\"We receive anonymous tips all the time,\" Ivan said, but he looked fidgety and I knew he had his doubts. If he'd been alone, maybe I could have talked him round to my way of thinking, and persuaded him to grant me the benefit of the doubt. But before I could say anything more, Con tossed another photo across the table at me, then another. Close-ups of Mark Ryter, capturing even more of the grisly details than the first.</p><p>\"People onour side don't kill other people,\" he said coldly. \"Even when they'd like to,\" he added meaningfully, pointing a finger at me.</p><p>I sighed and let it drop, knowing I couldn't convince them of my innocence. A few seconds of silence passed, while they settled down after the exchange and composed themselves. Then they switched the tape recorder on and the questions started again. Who was I? Where had I come from? Where did Vancha March go? How many people had we killed? On and on and on and ?</p><p>The police were getting nowhere with me, and it was frustrating them. Ivan and Con had been joined by another officer called Morgan, who had pinpoint eyes and dark brown hair. He sat stiff-backed, his hands flat on the table, subjecting me to a cool, unbreaking gaze. I had the feeling that Morgan was here to get nasty, although so far he'd made no violent moves against me.</p>","<p>\"How old are you?\" Con was asking. \"Where are you from? How long have you been here? Why pick this city? How many others have your murdered? Where are the bodies? What have?\"</p><p>He stopped at a knock on the door. Turning away, he went to see who was there. Ivan's eyes followed Con as he went, but Morgan's stayed on me. He blinked once every four seconds, no more, no less, like a robot.</p><p>Con had a murmured conversation with the person outside the door, then stood back and motioned the guard with the rifle away. The guard sidestepped over to the wall and trained his weapon on me, making sure I wouldn't try anything funny.</p><p>I was expecting another police officer, or maybe a soldier - I hadn't seen anyone from the army since I'd been arrested - but the meek little man who entered took me by complete surprise.</p><p>\"MrBlaws ?\" I gasped.</p><p>The school inspector who'd forced me to go to Mahler's looked nervous. He was carrying the same huge briefcase as before, and wearing the same old-fashioned bowler hat. He advanced half a metre, then stopped, reluctant to come any closer.</p><p>\"Thank you for coming, Walter,\" Ivan said, rising to shake the visitor's hand.</p><p>Mr Blaws nodded feebly and squeaked, \"Glad to be of assistance.\"</p><p>\"Would you like a chair?\" Ivan asked.</p><p>Mr Blaws shook his head quickly. \"No thanks. I'd rather not stop any longer than necessary. Rounds to do. Places to be. You know how it is.\"</p><p>Ivan nodded sympathetically. \"That's fine. You brought the papers?\"</p><p>Mr Blaws nodded. \"The forms he filled in, all the files we have on him. Yes. I left them with a man at the front desk. He's photocopying them and giving the originals back to me before I leave. I have to hang on to the originals for the school records.\"</p><p>\"Fine,\" Ivan said again, then stepped aside and jerked his head at me. \"Can you identify this boy?\" he asked officiously.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Mr Blaws said. \"He's Darren Horston. He enrolled with Mahler's on the ?\" He paused and frowned. \"I've forgotten the exact date. I should know it, because I was looking at it on the way in.\"</p><p>\"That's OK,\" Ivan smiled. \"We'll get it from the photocopies. But this is definitely the boy who called himself Darren Horston? You're sure?\"</p><p>Mr Blaws nodded firmly. \"Oh yes,\" he said. \"I never forget the face of a pupil, especially one who's played truant.\"</p><p>\"Thank you, Walter,\" Ivan said, taking the school inspector's arm. \"If we need you again, we'll ?\"</p><p>He stopped. Mr Blaws hadn't moved. He was staring at me with wide eyes and a trembling lip. \"Is it true?\" Mr Blaws asked. \"What the media are saying - he and his friends are the killers?\"</p><p>Ivan hesitated. \"We can't really say right now, but as soon as we?\"</p><p>\"How could you?\" Mr Blaws shouted at me. \"How could you kill all those people? And poor little Tara Williams - your own classmate!\"</p><p>\"I didn't kill Tara,\" I said tiredly. \"I didn't kill anybody. I'm not a killer. The police have arrested the wrong people.\"</p><p>\"Hah!\" Con snorted.</p><p>\"You're a beast,\" Mr Blaws growled, raising his briefcase high in the air, as though he meant to throw it at me. \"You should be - you should - should ?\"</p><p>He couldn't say any more. His lips tightened and his jaw clenched shut. Turning his back on me, he started out of the door. As he was stepping through, I reacted to a childish impulse and called him back.</p><p>\"Mr Blaws?\" I shouted. He paused and looked over his shoulder questioningly. I adopted an innocent, dismayed expression. \"This won't harm my grades, will it, sir?\" I enquired sweetly.</p><p>The school inspector gawped at me, then glared furiously when he realized I was teasing him, turned up his nose, showed me a clean pair of heels and clacked away down the corridor.</p><p>I laughed aloud as Mr Blaws departed, taking absurd comfort in the annoying little man's irate expression. Con, Ivan and the guard with the gun smiled too, despite themselves, but Morgan didn't. He remained as steely-faced as ever, a terrible, unspoken menace in his sharp, mechanical eyes.</p><p>Chapter SIX</p><p>IVAN WASreplaced by a burly police officer called Dave shortly after Mr Blaws had departed. Dave acted friendly - the first thing he did when he came in was ask me if I'd like anything to eat or drink - but I wasn't fooled. I'd watched enough TV shows to know all about the good cop/bad cop routine.</p><p>\"We're here to help you, Darren,\" Dave assured me, tearing open a sachet of sugar and pouring it into a plastic cup filled with steaming coffee. Some of the sugar spilt over the side, on to the table. I was ninety per cent certain the spill was deliberate - Dave wanted me to think he was a bumbler.</p><p>\"Taking off these handcuffs and setting me free would be a big help,\" I quipped, watching Dave cautiously as he tore open another sachet of sugar. Morgan worried me the most - Con might knock me around a bit, if things got rough, but I believed Morgan was capable of worse - but I'd have to be extra careful with Dave, or he'd worm my secrets out of me. I'd been awake a long time. I was drained and light-headed. Prone to slips.</p><p>\"Take off your handcuffs and set you free,\" Dave smirked, winking at me. \"Good one. Of course, we both know that isn't going to happen, but there are things Ican do. Get you a lawyer for one. A bath. A change of clothes. A nice bunk for the night. You're going to be with us a long time, I fear, but it doesn't have to be an unpleasant stay.\"</p><p>\"What do I have to do to make itpleasant ?\" I asked cagily.</p><p>Dave shrugged and sipped the coffee. \"Ouch! Too hot!\" Fanning his lips with a hand to cool them down, he smiled. \"Not much,\" he said in answer to my question. \"Tell us your real name, where you're from, what you're doing here. That kind of stuff.\"</p><p>I shook my head wryly - new face, same old questions.</p><p>Dave saw I wasn't going to answer, so he changed tack. \"That routine's stale, right? Let's try something else. Your friend, Harkat Mulds, says he needs his mask to survive, that he'll die if exposed to air for more than ten or twelve hours. Is that true?\"</p><p>I nodded cautiously. \"Yes.\"</p><p>Dave looked glum. \"This is bad,\" he muttered. \"Very, very bad.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I asked.</p><p>\"This is a prison, Darren. You and your friends are murder suspects. There are rules - guidelines - things we must do. Taking objects like belts, ties andmasks from possible killers when they're admitted is one of the rules.\"</p>","<p>I stiffened in my chair. \"You've taken away Harkat's mask?\" I snapped.</p><p>\"We had to,\" Dave said.</p><p>\"But he'll die without it!\"</p><p>Dave rolled his shoulders carelessly. \"We've only your word for that. It's not enough. But if you tell us what he is and why normal air is deadly for him - and if you tell us about your other friends, Crepsley and March - maybe we can help.\"</p><p>I glared hatefully at the policeman. \"So it's rat on my friends or you'll let Harkat die?\" I sneered.</p><p>\"That's a horrible way to put it,\" Dave protested warmly. \"We don't intend to let any of you die. If your short, unusual friend takes a turn for the worse, we'll hurry him down to the medical wing and patch him up, like we're doing for the man you took hostage. But?\"</p><p>\"Steve's here?\" I interrupted. \"You've got Steve Leopard in the medical wing?\"</p><p>\"SteveLeonard ,\" he corrected me, unaware of Steve's nickname. \"We brought him here to recover. Easier to guard him from the media.\"</p><p>That was great news. I thought we'd lost Steve. If we could get to him when we were escaping and take him with us, we could use him when it came to trying to save Debbie's life.</p><p>I stretched my chained hands above my head and yawned. \"What's the time?\" I asked casually.</p><p>\"Sorry,\" Dave smiled. \"That's classified information.\"</p><p>I lowered my arms. \"You know you asked me earlier if there was anything I wanted?\"</p><p>\"Uh-huh,\" Dave replied, eyes narrowing hopefully.</p><p>\"Would it be OKif I walked around for a few minutes? My legs are cramping up.\"</p><p>Dave looked disappointed - he'd been anticipating a more involved request. \"You can't leave this room,\" he said.</p><p>\"I'm not asking to. A couple of minutes pacing from one side to the other will be fine.\"</p><p>Dave checked with Con and Morgan to see what they thought.</p><p>\"Let him,\" Con said, \"as long as he stays on his own side of the table.\"</p><p>Morgan didn't say anything, just nodded once to show it was OK.</p><p>Pushing my chair back, I stood, stepped away from the table, jangled the chain linking my ankles together, loosening it, then walked from one wall to the other, stretching my legs, working the tension out of my muscles, formulating an escape plan.</p><p>After a while I stopped at one of the walls and rested my forehead against it. I began lightly kicking the lower part of the wall with my left foot, as if I was nervous and claustrophobic. In reality I was testing it. I wanted to know how thick the wall was and if I could break through.</p><p>The results of the test were unpromising. By the feel of the wall, and the dull echoes from my kicks, it was made of solid concrete, two or three blocks thick. I could bust through eventually, but it would take a lot of work and - more crucially - time. The guard by the door would have ample opportunity to raise his weapon and fire.</p><p>Levering myself away from the wall, I started walking again, eyes flicking from the door to the wall at the front of the cell. The door looked pretty solid - steel - but maybe the wall it was set in wasn't as thick as the others. Perhaps I could break through it quicker than through the sides or back. Wait until it was definitely night, hope the police left me alone in the cell, then smash through and ?</p><p>No. Even if the police left me, the video cameras set in the corners above the door wouldn't. Someone would be watching all the time. The alarm would sound as soon as I attacked the wall, and the corridor outside would fill with police within seconds.</p><p>It had to be the ceiling. From where I stood, I'd no idea whether it was reinforced or normal, if I could punch a way through or not. But it was the only logical escape route. If I was left alone, I could knock out the cameras, take to the rafters, and hopefully lose my pursuers along the way. I wouldn't have time to search for Harkat and Mr Crepsley, so I'd just have to hope they made it out by themselves.</p><p>It wasn't much of a plan - I still hadn't figured out how I was going to get the policemen to leave; I didn't think they'd withdraw for the night to let me catch up on my beauty sleep - but at least it was the beginning of one. The rest would fall into place along the way.</p><p>I hoped!</p><p>I walked for a few minutes more, then Dave asked me to sit again, and we were back to the questions. This time they came quicker than before, more urgently. I got the sense that their patience was nearing its end. Violence couldn't be far off.</p><p>The police were increasing the pressure. The offers of food and drinks were no longer being made, and Dave's smile was a slim shadow of its former self. The large officer had loosened his collar button and was sweating freely as he pounded me with question after question. He'd given up asking about my name and background. Now he wanted to know how many people I'd killed, where the bodies were, and if I was just an accomplice or an active member of the murderous gang.</p><p>In reply to his questions I kept saying, \"I didn't kill anyone. I'm not your enemy. You have the wrong person.\"</p><p>Con wasn't as polite as Dave. He'd started slamming the table with his fists and leaning forward menacingly every time he addressed me. I believed he was only minutes away from setting about me with his fists, and steeled myself against the blows which seemed sure to come.</p><p>Morgan hadn't changed. He sat quiet and still, staring relentlessly, blinking once every four seconds.</p><p>\"Are there others?\" Dave growled. \"Is it just the four of you, or are there more killers in the gang that we don't know about?\"</p><p>\"We're not killers,\" I sighed, rubbing my eyes, trying to stay alert.</p><p>\"Did you kill them first, then drink from them, or was it the other way round?\" Dave pressed.</p><p>I shook my head and didn't reply.</p><p>\"Do you really believe you're vampires, or is that a cover story, or some sick game you like to indulge in?\"</p><p>\"Leave me alone,\" I whispered, dropping my gaze. \"You've got it all wrong. We're not your enemies.\"</p><p>\"How many have you killed?\" Dave roared. Where are?\"</p><p>He stopped. People had poured into the corridor outside during the last few seconds, and now it was teeming with police and staff, all shouting wildly.</p><p>\"What the hell's going on?\" Dave snapped.</p><p>\"Want me to check?\" William McKay - the guard with the rifle - asked.</p><p>\"No,\" Con responded. \"I'll do it. You keep a watch on the boy.\"</p>","<p>Going to the door, Con banged on it and called for it to be opened. There was no immediate response, so he called again, louder, and this time it swung open. Stepping out, the dark-faced officer grabbed a woman who was rushing past and quickly shook a few answers out of her.</p><p>Con had to lean in close to the woman to hear what she was saying. When he had it straight, he let go of her and rushed back into my cell, eyes wide. \"It's a breakout!\" Con shouted.</p><p>\"Which one?\" Dave yelled, jumping up. \"Crepsley? Mulds?\"</p><p>\"Neither,\" Con gasped. \"It's the hostage - Steve Leonard!\"</p><p>\"Leonard?\" Dave repeated uncertainly. \"But he's not a prisoner. Why should he want to break?\"</p><p>\"I don't know!\" Con shouted. \"Apparently, he regained consciousness a few minutes ago, took stock of the situation, then murdered a guard and two nurses.\"</p><p>The colour drained from Dave's face, and William McKay almost dropped his rifle.</p><p>\"A guard and two ?\" Dave murmured.</p><p>\"That's not all,\" Con said. \"He's killed or wounded another three on his way out. They think he's still in the building.\"</p><p>Dave's face hardened. He started for the door, then remembered me, paused, and looked back over his shoulder.</p><p>\"I'm not a killer,\" I said quietly, staring him straight in the eye. \"I'm not the one you want. I'm on your side.\"</p><p>This time, I think he half-believed me.</p><p>\"What about me?\" William McKay asked as the two officers filed out. \"Do I stay or go?\"</p><p>\"Come with us,\" Con snapped.</p><p>\"What about the boy?\"</p><p>\"I'll take care of him,\" Morgan said softly. His eyes hadn't strayed from my face, even while Con was telling Dave about Steve. The guard hurried out after the others, slamming the door shut behind him.</p><p>I was alone at last - with Morgan.</p><p>The officer with the tiny, watchful eyes sat staring at me. Four seconds - blink. Eight seconds - blink. Twelve seconds - blink.</p><p>He leant forward, turned off the tape recorder, then stood and stretched. \"I thought we'd never get rid of them,\" he said. Strolling to the door, he glanced out of the small window set high in it, and spoke softly, his face hidden from the cameras overhead. \"You'll have to go through the ceiling, but you had figured that out already, hadn't you?\"</p><p>\"Excuse me?\" I said, startled.</p><p>\"I saw you casing the room while you were 'exercising',\" he smiled. \"The walls are too thick. You don't have time to break through.\"</p><p>I said nothing, but stared hard at the brown-haired officer, wondering what he was up to.</p><p>\"I'm going to attack you in a minute,\" Morgan said. \"I'll put on a show for the cameras, pretend to lose my rag and go for your throat. Slam me over the head with your fists, hard, and I'll go down for the count. After that it's up to you. I've no key for your chains, so you'll have to snap out of them yourself. If you can't - tough. Nor can I guarantee how much time you'll have, but with all the panic in the halls outside, there should be plenty.\"</p><p>\"Why are you doing this?\" I asked, stunned by the unexpected turn of events.</p><p>\"You'll see,\" Morgan said, spinning to face me, then advancing in what would appear on camera to be a violent, threatening manner. \"I'll be helpless when I hit the floor,\" Morgan said, waving his arms about wildly. \"If you decide to kill me, I won't be able to stop you. But from what I've heard, you're not the sort to kill a defenceless opponent.\"</p><p>\"Why should I want to kill you when you're helping me escape?\" I asked, bewildered.</p><p>Morgan grinned nastily. \"You'll see,\" he said again, then dived over the table at me.</p><p>I was so amazed by what was happening, that when he wrapped his hands around my throat, I didn't do anything, just stared back at him uncertainly. Then he squeezed tightly and self-preservation kicked in. Jerking my head backwards, I brought up my chained hands and shoved him away. He slapped at my hands, then came at me again. Lurching to my feet, I pushed his head down, held it between my knees, raised my arms, brought my hands together and smashed him over the back of his head.</p><p>With a grunt, Morgan slid off the table, dropped to the floor and lay there motionless. I was worried that I'd really hurt him. Hurrying around the table, I bent to check his pulse. As I leant down, I got close enough to his head to see through his thin layer of hair to the scalp beneath. What I saw sent a flash chill racing down my spine. Underneath the hair, tattooed into the flesh, was a large, rough 'V' - the mark of the vampets!</p><p>\"Yuh-yuh-yuh-you're ?\" I stuttered.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Morgan said softly. He'd landed with his left arm thrown over his face, hiding his mouth and eyes from the lens of the camera. \"And proud to serve the rightful rulers of the night.\"</p><p>I reeled away from the police vampet, more unnerved than ever. I'd thought the vampets served alongside their masters. It never occurred to me that some could be working undercover as ordinary humans.</p><p>Morgan opened his left eye and glanced up at me without moving. \"You'd better get moving,\" he hissed, \"before the cavalry arrives.\"</p><p>Remembering where I was and what was at stake, I got to my feet and tried not to dwell on the shock of finding a vampet here among the police. I wanted to leap on to the table and make my escape via the ceiling, but first there were the cameras to take care of. Bending, I picked up the tape recorder, quickly crossed the room and used the base of the recorder to shatter the video cameras, rendering them useless.</p><p>\"Very good,\" Morgan whispered as I retraced my steps. \"Very clever. Now fly, little bat. Fly like the devil is after you.\"</p><p>Pausing over the vampet, I glared down at him, drew back my right foot as far as my chains would allow, and kicked him hard in the side of the head. He grunted, rolled over and lay still. I didn't know if he was really unconscious or if this was part of his act, and I didn't stay to find out.</p><p>Jumping on to the table, I stuck my hands together, paused, then wrenched my wrists apart as sharply as possible, using all of my vampiric powers. I almost dislocated my lower arms, and roared aloud with pain, but it worked - the chain joining my handcuffs snapped in the middle, freeing my hands.</p><p>I stood on the ends of the chain linking my ankles, grabbed it in the middle and pulled upwards quickly.Too quickly - I rolled back off the table and collapsed in a heap on the floor!</p>","<p>Groaning, I rolled over, got up, stood on the chain again, braced my back against a wall, and made a second stab at the chain. This time I was successful and it snapped in two. I wrapped the twin lengths of chain around my ankles, to prevent them snagging on corners, then did the same thing with the chains dangling from my wrists.</p><p>I was ready. Hopping on to the table again, I crouched, took a deep breath, then leapt, the fingers of both hands held out flat and straight.</p><p>The ceiling, thankfully, was made of ordinary plaster tiles, and my fingers burst through with only the barest of resistance. Sweeping my hands apart while hovering in midair, my forearms connected with rafters on either side. Splaying my fingers, I caught hold of the lengths of wood as gravity dragged me back to earth, and held firm, halting my fall.</p><p>I hung there a moment, until I stopped swinging, then hauled my legs and body out of the cell, up into darkness and the freedom it promised.</p><p>Chapter SEVEN</p><p>THERE WASa gap of half a metre between the rafters I was lying on and those overhead. It wasn't much, and it made life very uncomfortable, but it was more than I'd expected.</p><p>Stretching out flat, I listened for sounds of pursuit in the cell below. There weren't any. I could hear people colliding with each other and barking out orders in the corridor, so either the police weren't aware I'd broken out, or had found their way blocked by the panicked crowds.</p><p>Whatever the answer, I had time on my side; time I hadn't bargained for, which I could put to good use. I'd planned to flee as swiftly as possible, leaving Mr Crepsley and Harkat behind, but now I was in a position to go and look for them.</p><p>But where to look? The light was pretty good up here - there were many cracks between the plaster tiles, and light seeped up from the rooms and corridors below - and I could see for ten or twelve metres whichever way I looked. This was a big building, and if my friends were being held on another floor, I hadn't a hope in hell of finding them. But if they were nearby, and I hurried ?</p><p>Scuttling over the rafters, I reached the ceiling of the cell next to mine, paused and cocked my ears. My sharp sense of hearing would detect any sound above that of a heartbeat. I waited a few seconds, but heard nothing. I moved on.</p><p>The next two cells were empty. In the third I heard someone scratching himself. I thought about calling out Mr Crepsley and Harkat's names, but if there were police in the cell, they would raise the alarm. There was only one thing for it. Taking a deep breath, I gripped the rafters on either side with my hands and feet, then punched through the thin material of the ceiling with my head.</p><p>I blew dust from my lips and blinked it out of my eyes, then focused on the scene below. I was ready to drop through the ceiling if either of my friends was within, but the only occupant was a bearded old man who stared up at me, mouth agape, blinking rapidly.</p><p>\"Sorry,\" I said, forcing a quick smile. \"Wrong room.\"</p><p>Withdrawing, I scurried forward, leaving the startled prisoner behind.</p><p>Three more empty cells. The next was occupied, but by two loud-talking men who'd been captured trying to rob a corner shop. I didn't stop to check on them - the police were hardly likely to lump a potential killer in with a couple of burglars.</p><p>Another empty cell. I thought the next was empty too, and had almost moved on when my ears picked up on the faint rustling of fabric. I came to a halt and listened intently, but there were no further sounds. Crawling backwards, skin itching from the insulating flakes which littered the ceiling tiles like snow, I got into position, took another deep breath, then head-butted through the tiles.</p><p>A wary Harkat Mulds jumped out of the chair he'd been sitting in and brought his arms up defensively as my head broke through and clouds of dust descended. Then the Little Person saw who it was, reached up, tore loose his mask (Dave had obviously been lying when he said they'd taken it away) and shouted my name with unconstrained delight. \"Darren!\"</p><p>\"Howdy, pardner,\" I grinned, using my hands to widen the hole. I shook the dust from my hair and eyebrows.</p><p>\"What are you doing - up there?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>I groaned at the dumb question. \"Sightseeing!\" I snapped, then lowered a hand. \"C'mon - we haven't much time, and we have to find Mr Crepsley.\"</p><p>I'm sure Harkat had a thousand questions - I had too, like how come he was all alone, and why wasn't he handcuffed? - but he realized how perilous our position was, grabbed the offered hand and let me drag him up, saying nothing.</p><p>He had a harder time squeezing on to the rafters than me - his body was a lot rounder than mine - but finally he was lying out flat beside me and we crawled forward, side by side, without discussing our plight.</p><p>The next eight or nine cells were empty or occupied by humans. I was growing anxious about the amount of time that had passed. Regardless of what was happening with Steve Leopard, my escape was bound to be noticed sooner rather than later, and pursuit would be fierce when it came. I was wondering whether it would be wiser to quit while we were ahead, when someone spoke from a spot in the cell underneath, just ahead of me.</p><p>\"I am ready to make a statement now,\" said the voice, and by the second syllable I had the speaker pegged - Mr Crepsley!</p><p>I held up a hand for Harkat to stop, but he'd heard it too and had already come to a standstill (or rather, acrawl still).</p><p>\"About time,\" a policeman said. \"Let me check that our recorder's working ?\"</p><p>\"Never mind your infernal recording device,\" Mr Crepsley sniffed. \"I do not address myself to inanimate machines. Nor do I waste words on buffoons. I will speak to neither you nor your partner on my left. As for that cretin by the door with the rifle ?\"</p><p>I had to stifle a giggle. The sly old fox! He must have heard us crawling about up here and was letting us know exactly how things stood in the cell, how many police were present and where they were.</p><p>\"You'd better watch yourself,\" the policeman snapped.</p><p>\"I've a good mind to?\"</p><p>\"You have no sort of mind at all,\" Mr Crepsley interrupted. \"You are a fool. The officer who was here earlier, on the other hand - Matt - struck me as a sensible man. Fetch him and I will confess. Otherwise my lips remain sealed.\"</p><p>The officer cursed, then shuffled to his feet and started for the door. \"Keep an eye on him,\" he told the other two. \"The first sign of a twitch - hit him hard! Remember who and what he is. Take no chances.\"</p><p>\"Find out what the fuss is about while you're out there,\" one of the other officers said as his colleague was leaving. \"The way people are rushing about, there must be some emergency.\"</p>","<p>\"Will do,\" the officer said, then called for the door to be opened and let himself out.</p><p>I pointed Harkat off to the left, where the guard by the door would be. He slid forward silently, stopping when he got a fix on the policeman. I listened for sounds of the officer closer to Mr Crepsley, tuned into his heavy breathing, shifted back a metre or so, then held my left hand up, the thumb and first two fingers spread. I counted to two and lowered my middle finger. Another couple of seconds and I bent down my index finger. Finally, nodding swiftly at Harkat, I lowered my thumb.</p><p>At the signal, Harkat let go of the rafters and dropped through the plaster tiles of the ceiling, smashing them to pieces in the process. I followed almost instantly, bringing my legs down first, howling like a wolf for added effect.</p><p>The policemen didn't know what to make of our sudden appearance. The guard by the door tried to bring his rifle up, but Harkat's plummeting body collided with his arms and knocked it free of his grip. My officer, meanwhile, only gawped at me, making no move to protect himself.</p><p>While Harkat clambered to his feet and threw punches at the guard, I drew a fist back to let the officer have a bunch of fives in the face. Mr Crepsley stopped me. \"Please,\" he said politely, getting to his feet and tapping the officer on the shoulder. \"Let me.\"</p><p>The officer turned as though hypnotized. Mr Crepsley opened his mouth and breathed the special knockout gas of the vampires over him. One whiff of it and the officer's eyes were rolling in their sockets. I caught him as he fell, and gently lowered him to the floor.</p><p>\"I was not expecting you so soon,\" Mr Crepsley said conversationally, picking at the lock of his left handcuff with the fingers of his right.</p><p>\"We didn't want to keep you waiting,\" I said tightly, eager to be out of there, but not wanting to appear any less composed than my old friend and mentor, who looked entirely untroubled.</p><p>\"You should not have rushed on my account,\" Mr Crepsley said, his handcuffs snapping free with a click. He bent to work on the chains around his ankles. \"I was perfectly content. These are old-style handcuffs, I was wriggling out of their kind before the officers holding me were even born. It was never a question ofif I was going to escape, but ratherwhen .\"</p><p>\"He can be an annoying - know-it-all sometimes,\" Harkat commented dryly. He'd knocked the guard out and had shuffled over to the table, to make his way back up to the safety of the ceiling.</p><p>\"We can leave you behind and return for you later,\" I suggested to the vampire as he stepped out of his leg restraints.</p><p>\"No,\" he said. \"I might as well depart now that you are here.\" He winced as he took a step forward. \"But, seriously, a few extra hours would not have been unwelcome. My ankle has healed considerably, but is not yet one hundred per cent. Further rest would have been beneficial.\"</p><p>\"Will you be able to walk?\" I asked.</p><p>He nodded. \"I will win no races, but nor shall I be a hindrance. I am more worried about the sun - I have over two and a half hours of it to deal with.\"</p><p>\"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,\" I snapped. \"Now, are you ready to continue, or do you want to stand here and shoot the breeze all day until the police come back?\"</p><p>\"Nervous?\" Mr Crepsley asked, a glint in his eye.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said.</p><p>\"Do not be,\" he told me. \"The worst the humans can do is kill us.\" He got up on the table and paused. \"By the end of the coming night, death may seem a blessing.\"</p><p>With that cheerless comment, he followed Harkat up into the gloomy half-world of the rafters. I waited for him to pull his legs clear, then jumped up after him. We spread out so we weren't in one another's way, then Mr Crepsley asked which direction we should take.</p><p>\"Right,\" I replied. \"That leads to the rear of the building, I think.\"</p><p>\"Very well,\" Mr Crepsley said, wriggling ahead of us. \"Crawl slowly,\" he whispered over his shoulder, \"and try not to pick up any splinters.\"</p><p>Harkat and I shared a rueful look - the phrase \"cool as a cucumber\" could have been invented with Mr Crepsley in mind - then hurried after the departing vampire before he got too far ahead and left us behind.</p><p>Chapter EIGHT</p><p>WE KICKEDour way through the wall at the back of the building and found ourselves on the second floor, above a deserted alley.</p><p>\"Can you jump?\" I asked Mr Crepsley.</p><p>\"No,\" he said, \"but I can climb.\"</p><p>While Mr Crepsley swung out over the edge of the hole in the wall and dug his nails into the bricks, Harkat and I dropped to the ground and crouched low, scanning the shadows for signs of life. When Mr Crepsley joined us, we hurried to the end of the alley, where we paused to scout the terrain.</p><p>Mr Crepsley glanced up at the sun. It wasn't very strong - a weak, autumnal, afternoon glow - but two hours of exposure could be fatal for the vampire. If he'd been wearing his cloak, he could have pulled it up over his head and sheltered beneath it, but he'd taken it off in the apartment and left it there.</p><p>\"What do we do now?\" Harkat asked, gazing around uncertainly.</p><p>\"Find a manhole and get underground,\" I replied. \"They won't be able to track us through the tunnels, and Mr Crepsley won't have to worry about the sun.\"</p><p>\"A worthy plan,\" Mr Crepsley said, rubbing his sore right ankle and looking for a manhole cover. There weren't any in the immediate vicinity, so we pressed on, Harkat and I supporting the vampire, sticking close to the walls of the alley.</p><p>The alley forked at the end. The left turn led towards a busy main street, the right on to another dark alley. I'd turned right on impulse and was starting towards the alley when Harkat stopped me.</p><p>\"Wait,\" he hissed. \"I see a way down.\"</p><p>I looked back and saw a cat picking through a mound of rubbish which had spilt out of a toppled bin and half-obscured a round manhole cover. Hurrying over, we shooed the cat away - cats aren't great lovers of vampires, and it hissed angrily at us before fleeing - and kicked the rubbish from the cover. Then Harkat and I pulled the cover off and laid it to one side.</p><p>\"I'll go first,\" I said, starting down the ladder into the welcome darkness. \"Mr Crepsley next. Harkat last.\"</p><p>They didn't question my orders. As a Vampire Prince, it was my place to take control. Mr Crepsley would have objected if he disagreed with my decision, but in the normal run of things he was satisfied to follow my command.</p>","<p>I climbed down the ladder. The rungs were cold and my fingers tingled from the contact. As I neared the bottom, I stretched out my left leg to step off the ladder?</p><p>?then snatched it back quickly when a gun fired and a bullet tore a chunk out of the wall close to the side of my shin!</p><p>Heart pounding, I clung to the ladder, ears ringing from the echoes of the bullet, wondering how the police got down here so quickly, and how they knew which way we'd take.</p><p>Then someone chuckled in the darkness and said, \"Greetings, vampire. We've been expecting you.\"</p><p>My eyes narrowed. That was no policeman - it was a vampet! Despite the danger, I squatted low on the ladder and peered up the tunnel. There was a large man standing in the shadows, too far away for me to identify.</p><p>\"Who are you?\" I snapped.</p><p>\"One who follows the Lord of the Vampaneze,\" he answered.</p><p>\"What are you doing here?\"</p><p>\"Blocking your passage,\" he chuckled.</p><p>\"How did you know we'd come this way?\"</p><p>\"We didn't But we guessed you'd escape and make for the tunnels. Our Lord doesn't want you down here yet - the day is long, and it amuses him to think of you and your vampire friend struggling through it - so we've blocked off all entrances to the underworld. When night falls, we'll retreat, but until then these tunnels are off limits.\"</p><p>With that, he fired at me again. It was a warning shot, like the first, but I didn't stick around to test his aim any further. Climbing the ladder, I shot out of the manhole as though propelled, and cursed loudly as I kicked a large empty tin across the alley.</p><p>\"Police?\" Mr Crepsley asked sullenly.</p><p>\"No - vampets. They've blocked off all entrances to the tunnels until nightfall. They want us to suffer.\"</p><p>\"They can't have coveredevery - entrance, can they?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"Enough of them,\" Mr Crepsley responded. \"The tunnels this close to the surface are carefully linked. By choosing the right spot, one man can block the paths of six or seven entrances. If we had time, we might find a way past, but we do not. We must abandon the tunnels.\"</p><p>\"Where do we go instead?\" I asked.</p><p>\"We run,\" the vampire said simply. \"Or hobble, as the case may be. We try to avoid the police, find somewhere to hole up, and wait for night.\"</p><p>\"That won't be easy,\" I noted.</p><p>Mr Crepsley shrugged. \"If you had held tight for sunset to make your break, it would have been easier. You did not, so we must make the best of things. Come,\" he said, turning his back on the manhole. \"Let us make tracks.\"</p><p>I paused to spit bitterly down the hole, then took off after Mr Crepsley and Harkat, putting the disappointment of the blocked-off tunnels behind, focusing on the flight ahead.</p><p>Less than three minutes later, the police were hot on our trail.</p><p>We heard them spilling out of the station, shouting at each other, piling into cars, honking horns, turning blaring sirens on full. We'd been moving steadily but hadn't drifted far away from the station - we'd been avoiding main streets, sticking to back alleys, which had an annoying habit of doubling back on themselves. We'd have taken to the rooftops, except that would have meant exposing Mr Crepsley more fully to the rays of the sun.</p><p>\"This is useless,\" the vampire said as we drew up beside a building overlooking a busy shopping street. \"We are making no progress. We must ascend.\"</p><p>\"But the sun ?\" I said.</p><p>\"Forget it,\" he snapped. \"If I burn, I burn. It will not kill me immediately - but the police will if they catch up!\"</p><p>Nodding, I looked for a way up to the roofs. Then a thought struck. I gazed at the teeming street, then studied my clothes. I was dishevelled and dirty, but didn't look a whole lot worse than any average teenager going through a grunge or heavy metal phase.</p><p>\"Have we money?\" I asked, rubbing the worst of the dirt from my face and slicking back my hair with a handful of spit. Then I tucked the chains of the cuffs in under my shirt ends and trouser legs, masking them from view.</p><p>\"The time he picks to go shopping!\" Harkat groaned.</p><p>\"I know what I'm doing,\" I grinned. \"Have we money or not?\"</p><p>\"I had some notes, but the police took them,\" Mr Crepsley said. \"I am - how do the humans put it ?skinned ?\"</p><p>\"Skint,\" I laughed. \"No matter. I'll do without.\"</p><p>\"Wait!\" Harkat said as I started forward. \"Where are you going? We can't split up - now. We must stay together.\"</p><p>\"I won't be long,\" I said. \"And I won't take any stupid chances. Wait here for me. If I'm not back in five minutes, leave without me and I'll catch up with you later, in the tunnels.\"</p><p>\"Where are you?\" Mr Crepsley began, but I didn't have time for a debate, so I slid out of the alley before he finished and walked swiftly along the street, looking for a minimarket.</p><p>I kept one eye peeled for police or soldiers, but there were none about. After a few seconds, I spotted a shop across the street, waited for the light to turn green, then strolled across and entered. A middle-aged woman and a young man with long hair were serving behind the counter. The shop was quite busy - there were six or seven customers - which was good. It meant I wouldn't stick out. A TV on the left of the doorway was tuned to a news channel, but the sound was down low. There was a security camera above the TV, scanning and recording, but that didn't bother me - with all the crimes I'd been charged with, I wasn't going to sweat about being booked for petty theft!</p><p>I walked slowly up and down the aisles, looking for sun-wear items. It wasn't the right time of year for sunglasses and sun hats, but I was sure they'd have a few knick-knacks lying around somewhere.</p><p>Next to a row of baby-care products, I found them - several bottles of suntan lotion, standing forlornly on a battered old shelf. The choice wasn't great, but they'd do. I quickly read the labels, looking for the strongest sun block I could find. Factor ten - twelve - fifteen. I chose the bottle with the highest number (it was for fair-skinned babies, but I wouldn't tell Mr Crepsley that!), then stood uncertainly with it in my hand, wondering what to do next.</p><p>I wasn't an experienced shoplifter. I'd stolen a few sweets with friends when I was very young, and once swiped a load of golf balls with a cousin of mine, but I'd never enjoyed it and hadn't taken it any further. I was sure my face would give me away if I just pocketed the bottle and tried walking straight out of the shop.</p>","<p>I thought about it for a few seconds, then slyly slipped the bottle inside the waist of my trousers, draped the hem of my shirt over it, grabbed another bottle, turned and marched up to the counter.</p><p>\"Excuse me,\" I said to the female assistant as she was serving one of the other customers, \"but do you have any Sun Undone lotion?\" I'd made the name up, and hoped there wasn't a real brand by that name available.</p><p>\"Only what's on the shelves,\" the woman snapped irritably.</p><p>\"Oh,\" I smiled. \"That's OK. Thanks. I'll put this back.\"</p><p>I was turning when the young, long-haired man said, \"Hey! Hold on!\" Stomach sinking, I looked back questioningly, getting ready to run. \"It wasn't Sunnydun you wanted, was it?\" he asked. \"We've got a crate of those somewhere in the back. I could get a bottle if you?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I interrupted, relaxing. \"It was Sun Undone. My mum won't use anything else.\"</p><p>\"Suit yourself,\" he shrugged, no longer interested, turning to deal with another customer.</p><p>I walked back to the shelf, laid the bottle on it, and made for the door as casually as I could. I nodded amiably at the young man as I was passing, and he half-waved at me in reply. I had one foot out the door, delighted with myself, when I caught sight of a familiar face on the TV and stopped, dumbstruck.</p><p>It wasme !</p><p>The photograph must have been taken this morning, while I was being arrested. I looked pale, haggard and frightened, my hands cuffed, eyes wary, policemen on either side of me.</p><p>Stepping back into the store, I reached up and turned up the volume.</p><p>\"Hey!\" the male attendant grunted. \"You can't ?\"</p><p>I ignored him and concentrated on what the newsreader was saying.</p><p>\"?might look harmless, but police are urging the public not to be taken in by his appearance. Darren Shan - or Darren Horston, as he is also known - is a teenager, but he consorts with brutal killers, and may be a killer himself.\"</p><p>My photograph faded, to be replaced by a female newsreader with a grim expression. After a couple of seconds, my photo appeared again, smaller this time, in the upper right hand corner of the screen. Harkat's appeared to the left, and accurate artist's impressions of Mr Crepsley and Vancha March between us.</p><p>\"To repeat our incredible breaking story,\" said the newsreader. \"Four alleged members of the gang of killers known as the Vampires were cornered by the police this morning. One, Vancha March?\" the lines around the drawing of Vancha flashed \"?escaped, taking Chief Inspector Alice Burgess hostage. The other three were arrested and detained for questioning, but made a violent break for freedom less than twenty minutes ago, killing or seriously wounding an unspecified number of officers and nurses. They are considered armed and exceedingly dangerous. If spotted, they should not be approached. Instead, call one of the following numbers ?\"</p><p>I turned away from the TV, stunned. I should have known the media would go into overdrive about a story this big, but I'd innocently assumed that we had only the police and army to worry about. I'd never stopped to think of city-wide alerts and how they'd affect us.</p><p>As I stood, digesting this new turn of events, brooding on the news that we'd been blamed for Steve's murders in the station, the middle-aged lady behind the counter pointed at me and gasped in a high voice, \"It's him! The boy! Thekiller !\"</p><p>Startled, I looked up and saw that every person in the shop was staring at me, their faces twisted with fear and horror.</p><p>\"It's the one called Darren Shan!\" a customer yelled. \"They say he killed that girl, Tara Williams - that he drank her blood and ate her!\"</p><p>\"He's a vampire!\" a wrinkly old man shrieked. \"Someone get a stake! We have to kill him!\"</p><p>That might have been funny if I'd seen it in a film - the thought of this little old man driving a stake through a vampire's hardened heart was ludicrous - but I hadn't time to see the funny side of things. Raising my hands to show I wasn't armed, I backed out of the door.</p><p>\"Derek!\" the female assistant shouted at the young man. \"Grab the gun and shoot him!\"</p><p>That was enough for me. Pivoting sharply, I dived out of the door and raced across the road, not stopping for traffic, darting out of the way of cars as they screeched to a halt, ignoring the drivers as they pounded on their horns and yelled abuse after me.</p><p>I came to a halt in the mouth of the alley, where a worried Harkat and Mr Crepsley were waiting. Digging out the bottle of suntan lotion, I tossed it to the vampire. \"Spread that on yourself, quick,\" I gasped, bending over for breath.</p><p>\"What?\" he began to ask.</p><p>\"Don't argue!\" I shouted. \"Do it!\"</p><p>The vampire yanked the top off the bottle and poured half the contents out into his hands, then smeared it over his face and scalp and other exposed areas. He rubbed the lotion in, poured the rest out, rubbed that in too, then tossed the bottle away into the gutter.</p><p>\"Done,\" he said.</p><p>\"We certainly are,\" I muttered, standing up. \"You're not going to believe?\"</p><p>\"There they are!\" someone bellowed, cutting me short. \"That's them - the Vampires!\"</p><p>The three of us looked around and I saw the little old wrinkly man from the shop wrestling a large rifle from the long-haired attendant. \"Give me that!\" he shouted. \"I hunted deer when I was younger!\"</p><p>Tossing his walking stick to one side, the pensioner turned, lifted the rifle with remarkable speed, and fired.</p><p>We fell to the ground as the wall above our heads exploded into fragments. The old man fired again, even closer this time. But then he had to pause to reload. While he was doing that, we jumped to our feet, about-faced and fled, Mr Crepsley swinging his injured leg forward and backward like a demented Long John Silver.</p><p>The crowd behind us paused a moment, torn between fear and excitement. Then, with roars of rage, they grabbed sticks and iron bars and the lids off rubbish bins, and surged after us. No longer a mere crowd, but a bloodthirstymob .</p><p>Chapter NINE</p><p>WE TOREahead of the mob to begin with - humans can't match vampires or Little People for speed - but then Mr Crepsley's right ankle swelled up and his pace dropped steadily.</p><p>\"No - good,\" he gasped, as we stopped at a corner and rested. \"Cannot - continue. You must go - on without me.\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said instantly. \"We're taking you with us.\"</p>","<p>\"I cannot - keep up,\" he snarled, teeth gritted against the pain.</p><p>\"Then we'll stand and fight,\" I told him. \"But we stick together. That's an order.\"</p><p>The vampire forced a weak smile. \"Careful, Darren,\" he said. \"You might be a Prince, but you are still my assistant. I can slap sense into you if I have to.\"</p><p>\"That's why I have to keep you with me,\" I grinned.</p><p>\"You stop me from getting a big head.\"</p><p>Mr Crepsley sighed and bent to rub the purple flesh around his ankle.</p><p>\"Here!\" Harkat said, and we looked up. The Little Person had pulled down the ladder of an overhead fire escape. \"They'll find it hard to follow if - we take to the roofs. We must go up.\"</p><p>Mr Crepsley nodded. \"Harkat is correct.\"</p><p>\"Will the lotion protect you from the sun?\" I asked.</p><p>\"From the worst of it,\" he said. \"I will be red by sunset, but it should prevent severe burning.\"</p><p>\"Then let's go!\"</p><p>I was first up the ladder, Mr Crepsley next, Harkat last. The mob poured into the alley as Harkat was drawing his legs up, and those to the fore almost grabbed him. He had to kick hard at their hands to break free, then hurried up after us.</p><p>\"Let me shoot!\" the little old man with the rifle was shouting. \"Out of my way! I can take them!\" But there were too many people in the alley. It was packed tight and he couldn't raise his rifle to aim.</p><p>While the humans squabbled over who would get the ladder, we scrambled up the stairs. Mr Crepsley moved faster now that he had a railing to lean on for support. He winced as we moved out of the shadows and into direct sunlight, but didn't slow down.</p><p>I paused at the top of the fire escape and waited for Mr Crepsley. As I stood there, feeling more confident than I had a couple of minutes earlier, a helicopter dropped from the sky and someone yelled at me through a megaphone, \"Stop where you are or we'll shoot!\"</p><p>Cursing, I called down to Mr Crepsley, \"Quick! We have to go now or?\"</p><p>I got no further. Above, a marksman opened fire. The air around me whizzed with bullets, which zinged piercingly off the bars of the fire escape. Screaming wildly, I threw myself down the stairs and collided with Mr Crepsley and Harkat. If Mr Crepsley hadn't been holding on so tightly to the rail to ease the pressure on his injured ankle, we might all have gone over the side!</p><p>We hurried down a couple of flights, where the marksman couldn't see us, then huddled on a landing, frightened - miserable ?trapped .</p><p>\"They might have to leave - to refuel,\" Harkat said hopefully.</p><p>\"Sure,\" I snorted, \"in an hour or two!\"</p><p>\"How are the humans below faring?\" Mr Crepsley asked.</p><p>I stuck my head over the side and looked down. \"The first few have made it to the top of the ladder. They'll be on us in a minute or less.\"</p><p>\"We are in a good position to defend ourselves here,\" the vampire mused. \"They will have to attack in small groups. We should be able to push them back.\"</p><p>\"Sure,\" I snorted again, \"but what good will that do? A few more minutes and the police and soldiers will arrive. It won't take them long to climb the building opposite and pick us off with their rifles.\"</p><p>\"Damned above and damned below,\" Harkat said, wiping a few beads of green sweat from his round, bald head. \"That leaves ?\" He pointed to the window behind us, leading into the building.</p><p>\"Another trap,\" I complained. \"All the police have to do is surround the building, enter in armed teams, flush us out - and we're finished.\"</p><p>\"True,\" Mr Crepsley agreed thoughtfully, \"but what if they have to fight to get in? And what if we are not there when they arrive?\"</p><p>We stared at Mr Crepsley questioningly. \"Follow me,\" he said, sliding the window open and crawling inside. \"I have a plan!\"</p><p>Turning our backs on the advancing humans beneath and the hovering helicopter above, Harkat and I dived through the window and into the hall, where Mr Crepsley was on his feet and calmly brushing flecks of dirt from his shirt, as though waiting for a bus on a slow Sunday morning.</p><p>\"Ready?\" he asked when we were standing beside him.</p><p>\"Ready forwhat ?\" I replied, exasperated.</p><p>\"Ready to set the cat among the pigeons,\" he laughed. Striding to the nearest door, he paused a moment, then slammed on it with the flat of his palm. \"Vampires!\" he bellowed. \"Vampires in the building! Everybody out!\"</p><p>He stepped away, faced us, and started counting. \"One. Two. Three. Fo?\"</p><p>The door burst open and a woman wearing a skimpy nightdress and no shoes raced out into the hallway, screeching and waving her hands above her head.</p><p>\"Quick!\" Mr Crepsley shouted, taking her arm and pointing her towards the stairs. \"Head for the ground floor! We have to get out! We will die if we stay! The vampires are here!\"</p><p>\"Aiiieeee!\" she screamed, then ran with astonishing speed for the stairs.</p><p>\"See?\" Mr Crepsley beamed.</p><p>\"I see,\" I smirked.</p><p>\"Me too,\" Harkat said.</p><p>\"Then get busy,\" Mr Crepsley said, hopping to the next door, pounding upon it, roaring, \"Vampires! Vampires! Beware the living dead!\"</p><p>Harkat and I ran ahead of him, mimicking his knocks and cries, and within seconds the hallway was jammed with terrified humans, running about directionlessly, knocking one another over, almost flying down the stairs to safety.</p><p>As we reached the end of the corridor, I glanced over the railing of the stairway and saw those rushing down the stairs colliding with members of the mob, who'd stormed the building in an attempt to track us through it. Those fleeing couldn't get out, and those chasing us couldn't get in.</p><p>Wicked!</p><p>\"Hurry,\" Harkat said, slapping my back. \"They're coming in by the - fire escape.\"</p><p>Looking back, I saw the first of our pursuers poking his head through the window. I turned left and raced up the next corridor with Harkat and Mr Crepsley, raising a false alarm, emptying the apartments of their human inhabitants, clogging the hallway behind us.</p><p>While the mob vanguard clashed with the panicked residents, we turned down another corridor, fled to a fire escape on the opposite side of the building, crawled out, and leapt across to the neighbouring block of apartments. We darted through this one, spreading the same warning message, banging on doors, yelling about vampires, causing havoc.</p>","<p>Making our way to the rear of the building, we jumped across to a third apartment block, and again set the humans running in fear for their lives. But when we got to the end of this one, we paused and gazed on the alley below and the sky overhead. There was no sign of the mob, and the helicopter was hovering over the two buildings behind us. We could hear police sirens closing in.</p><p>\"Now is the time to lose ourselves,\" Mr Crepsley said. \"The chaos behind us will last a handful of minutes at most. We must make good use of that time.\"</p><p>\"Which way do we go?\" I asked, scanning the surrounding buildings.</p><p>Mr Crepsley's eyes darted from one building to another, settling on a low-built structure to our right. \"There,\" he pointed. \"That looks deserted. We will try it and pray that the luck of the vampires is with us.\"</p><p>There was no fire escape where we were, so we hurried down the stairs at the back of the budding and out into the alley. Sticking close to the walls, we crept to the building we'd set our sights on, broke a window to gain entry - no alarms sounded - and found ourselves in an old, abandoned factory.</p><p>We stumbled up a couple of floors, then ran as fast as we could to the back. There we discovered the shell of a decrepit apartment building due for demolition. Tearing through the lower floor, we emerged at the far side on to a maze of tight, dark, unpopulated alleys. We paused, ears open for sounds of pursuit. There weren't any.</p><p>We shared quick, shaky grins, then Harkat and I wrapped an arm around Mr Crepsley. He raised his painful right foot and we hobbled forward at a slower pace than before, enjoying our period of respite, but experienced enough to know that we weren't out of the frying pan yet. Not by a long shot.</p><p>Through the alleys we fled. We passed a few people, but none paid any attention to us - the afternoon was darkening with heavy clouds, casting the already gloomy alleys into pools of murky shadows. We could see clearly with our advanced eyesight, but to humans we appeared as nothing more than vaguely defined figures in the half-light. Neither the mob nor the police followed. We could still hear the ruckus they were creating, but it hadn't moved on from the three apartment blocks we'd terrorized. For the time being, we were in the clear.</p><p>We stopped outside the back of a supermarket to catch our breath. Mr Crepsley's right leg was purple up to his knee now and he must have been in immense pain. \"We need ice for that,\" I said. \"I could slip into the supermarket and?\"</p><p>\"No!\" the vampire barked. \"You have already inspired one mob with your shopping antics. We can do very nicely without inciting another.\"</p><p>\"I was only trying to help,\" I grumbled.</p><p>\"I know,\" he sighed, \"but reckless risks only make matters worse. My injury is not as serious as it looks. A few hours' rest and I will be fine.\"</p><p>\"How about these bins?\" Harkat asked, tapping a couple of large, black rubbish bins. \"We could crawl inside and wait - for night.\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said. \"People use bins like this all the time. We'd be discovered.\"</p><p>\"Then where?\" Harkat enquired.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" I snapped. \"Maybe we can find an empty apartment or an abandoned building. We could duck into Debbie's if we were close enough, but we're too far ?\"</p><p>I stopped, eyes settling on a street sign across from the supermarket. \"Baker's Lane,\" I muttered, rubbing the bridge of my nose. \"I know this place. We've been here before, when we were searching for the vampaneze killers, before we knew about R.V. and Steve.\"</p><p>\"We travelled almost everywhere in our search for the killers,\" Mr Crepsley commented.</p><p>\"Yes, but I remember this place because - because ?\"</p><p>I frowned, and then it came to me and I snapped my fingers. \"Because Richard lives close by!\"</p><p>\"Richard?\" Mr Crepsley frowned. \"Your friend from school?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said, excited. \"His house is only three or four minutes away.\"</p><p>\"You think he'd shelter us?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"Maybe, if I explain things to him.\" The others looked uncertain. \"Have you any better ideas?\" I challenged them. \"Richard's a friend. I trust him. The worst he can do is turn us away.\"</p><p>Mr Crepsley thought about it a moment, then nodded. \"Very well. We will ask him for help. As you say, we have nothing to lose.\"</p><p>Leaving the supermarket, we struck for Richard's house, and this time I walked with a bounce in my step. I was sure Richard would help. After all, hadn't I saved him on the stairs at Mahler's?</p><p>We made it to Richard's in just over four minutes. Wasting no time, we climbed on to the roof and hid in the shadows of a large chimney. I'd seen a light in Richard's room from the ground, so once I was sure that Harkat and Mr Crepsley were settled, I crept to the edge of the roof and lowered myself over it.</p><p>\"Wait,\" Mr Crepsley whispered, sliding up beside me. \"I will come with you.\"</p><p>\"No,\" I whispered back. \"The sight of you might scare him. Let me go alone.\"</p><p>\"Very well,\" he said, \"but I will wait outside the window, in case you run into trouble.\"</p><p>I didn't see what sort of trouble I could run into, but Mr Crepsley had a stubborn look in his eyes, so I simply nodded and swung out over the roof, got a toehold, drove my fingernails into the stone of the wall, then climbed down to Richard's room like a spider.</p><p>The curtains were drawn, but not all the way, and I was able to see directly into my friend's bedroom. Richard was lying on his bed, a packet of popcorn and a glass of orange juice propped on his chest, watching a rerun of theAddams Family on a portable TV set.</p><p>Richard was laughing at the antics of the TV freaks, and I had to smile at how oddly fitting it was that he should be watching this when three real freaks of the night had just turned up. Fate has a strange sense of humour.</p><p>I thought about knocking on the window, but that might startle him. I studied the simple latch inside the glass, then pointed it out to Mr Crepsley (who'd scaled down the wall beside me) and raised my eyebrows in a silent question: \"Can you open it?\"</p><p>The vampire rubbed the thumb, index and middle fingers of his right hand together very,very swiftly. When he'd produced a strong static charge, he lowered his hand, pointed his fingers at the latch, and made a gentle uplifting motion.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>The vampire frowned, leant forward for a closer look, then snorted. \"It is made of plastic!\" I turned aside to hide a smile. \"No matter,\" Mr Crepsley said, and cut a small hole in the glass with the nail of his right index finger. It made only a tiny squeaking noise, which Richard didn't hear over the sound of the TV. Mr Crepsley popped the glass inwards, crooked the latch up with his finger, then swung out of the way and motioned me forward.</p>","<p>Taking a deep breath to steady myself, I pushed the window open and stepped into the room as casually as possible. \"Hi, Richard,\" I said.</p><p>Richard's head jerked around. When he realized who it was, his jaw dropped and he began to quiver.</p><p>\"It's OK,\" I said, taking a step closer to the bed, raising my hands in a gesture of friendship. \"I'm not going to hurt you. I'm in trouble, Richard, and I need your help. I've a cheek to ask, but could you put me and a couple of my friends up for a few hours? We'll hide in the wardrobe or under the bed. We won't be any bother, honest.\"</p><p>\"Vuh-vuh-vuh,\" Richard stuttered, eyes wide with terror.</p><p>\"Richard?\" I asked, concerned. \"Are you OK?\"</p><p>\"Vuh-vuh-vampire!\" he croaked, pointing a trembling finger at me.</p><p>\"Oh,\" I said. \"You've heard. Yes, I'm a half-vampire, but it's not what you think. I'm not evil or a killer. Let me call my friends, we'll get comfy, then I'll tell you all about?\"</p><p>\"Vampire!\" Richard screamed, loudly this time, then turned to face the door of his room and bellowed at the top of his lungs: \"Mum! Dad! Vampires! Vampires! Vampires! Vam?\"</p><p>His cries were cut short by Mr Crepsley, who swung into the room, darted ahead of me, grabbed the boy by his throat, and breathed sharply over his face. Gas shot up Richard's nose and into his mouth. For a second he struggled, terrified. Then his features relaxed, his eyes closed, and he slumped back on the bed.</p><p>\"Check the door!\" Mr Crepsley hissed, rolling off the bed, crouching on the floor defensively.</p><p>I obeyed immediately, even though Richard's reaction had left me sick to my stomach. Opening the door a crack, I listened for sounds of Richard's family rushing to investigate his cry. They didn't come. The larger TV set in the living room was turned on and the noise must have masked Richard's shouts.</p><p>\"It's OK,\" I said, closing the door. \"We're safe.\"</p><p>\"So much for friendship,\" Mr Crepsley snapped, brushing a few popcorn crumbs from his clothes.</p><p>\"He was scared witless,\" I said miserably, staring down at Richard. \"We were friends - he knew me - I saved his life - and for all that, he still thought I was here to kill him.\"</p><p>\"He believes you are a blood-crazed monster,\" Mr Crepsley said. \"Humans do not understand vampires. His reaction was predictable. We would have anticipated it and left him alone if we had been thinking clearly.\"</p><p>Mr Crepsley turned slowly and examined the room.</p><p>\"This would be a good place to hide,\" he said. \"The boy's family will probably not bother him when they see that he is sleeping. There is plenty of space in the wardrobe. I think all three of us could fit.\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said firmly. \"I won't take advantage of him. If he'd offered his help - great. But he didn't. He was afraid of me. It'd be wrong to stay.\"</p><p>Mr Crepsley's expression showed what he thought of that, but he respected my wishes and made for the window without any argument. I was heading after him when I saw that during the brief struggle the popcorn had spilled over the bedsheets, and the glass of orange juice had been knocked over. Stopping to shovel the popcorn back into its packet, I found a box of tissues, ripped several free and used them to mop up the worst of the orange juice. I made sure Richard was OK, set the TV to stand-by, bid my friend a silent goodbye, and left quietly, to run once again from the misguided humans who wished to kill me.</p><p>Chapter TEN</p><p>WE TOOKto the rooftops. There were no helicopters nearby, and the shadows of the gloomy afternoon masked us from general view, so it seemed safer to carry on up high, where we could make good time.</p><p>Moving carefully but quickly, we aimed for areas far beyond the chaos behind us, where we could hole up until night. For fifteen minutes we leapt and slid from one rooftop to another, unseen by anyone, getting further and further away from the humans who were hunting us.</p><p>Finally, we came to a crumbling old silo - a building in which grain was once stored. A spiral staircase still ran up the outside, though the lowest section had rotted and crumbled away. Leaping on to the upper half of the stairs from a roof, we climbed to the top, kicked down the locked door and let ourselves in.</p><p>Closing the door, we edged further into the silo along a narrow ledge, until we reached a semi-circular platform, where we lay down. There were holes and cracks in the roof overhead and the dim light was strong enough for us to see by.</p><p>\"Do you think we'll be - safe here?\" Harkat asked, lowering his mask. Streams of green sweat were flooding the scars and stitches of his grey face.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Mr Crepsley said confidently. \"They will have to organize a complete search. They dare leave no stone unturned. That will slow them down. It will be morning or later before they make it this far across the city.\" The vampire shut his eyes and massaged his eyelids. Even doused in suntan lotion, his skin had turned a dark pink colour.</p><p>\"How are you bearing up?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Better than I dared hope,\" he said, still rubbing his eyelids. \"I have the start of an excruciating headache, but now that I am out of the sunlight, perhaps it will subside.\" He lowered his fingers, opened his eyes, stretched his right leg out and stared grimly at the swollen flesh rising from his ankle to his knee. He'd taken his shoes off earlier, which was a good thing, as I doubt he'd have been able to pry the right shoe loose now. \"I only hopethat subsides too,\" he muttered.</p><p>\"Do you think it will?\" I asked, studying the ugly bruise.</p><p>\"Hopefully,\" he said, rubbing his lower leg gingerly. \"If not, we may have to bleed it.\"</p><p>\"You mean cut into it to let the blood out?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he said. \"Desperate times call for desperate measures. But we will wait and see - with luck it will improve of its own accord.\"</p><p>While Mr Crepsley was tending to his ankle, I unwrapped the chains around my wrists and legs and tried picking the locks. Mr Crepsley had taught me the fundamentals of lock-picking, but I'd never quite got the knack of it.</p><p>\"Here,\" he said after a couple of minutes, when he saw I wasn't getting anywhere.</p><p>The vampire made quick work of the locks, and seconds later the cuffs and chains were lying in heaps on the floor. I rubbed my freed flesh gratefully, then glanced at Harkat, who was using the hem of his robes to wipe green sweat from his face. \"How come they didn't put handcuffs on you?\" I asked.</p>","<p>\"They did,\" he replied, \"but they took them off - once I was inside my cell.\"</p><p>\"Why?\"</p><p>The Little Person's wide mouth split into a hideous smirk. \"They didn't know what I was or - what to make of me. They asked if I was in - pain, so I said I was. They asked if the handcuffs - hurt, so I said they did. So they took them off.\"</p><p>\"Just like that?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he chuckled.</p><p>\"Lucky beggar,\" I sniffed.</p><p>\"Looking like something Dr Frankenstein - threw together has its advantages sometimes,\" Harkat informed me. \"That's also why I was - alone. I could see they were uneasy - around me, so shortly after they began interviewing - me, I told them not to touch me - said I had an - infectious disease. You should have seen them - run!</p><p>All three of us laughed aloud.</p><p>\"You should've told them you were a resurrected corpse,\" I chuckled. \"That would have put their minds at rest!\"</p><p>We relaxed after that and lay back against the wall of the silo, saying little, eyes half-closed, ruminating on the day's events and the night to come. I was thirsty, so after a while I climbed down the interior stairs and went looking for water. I didn't find any, but I did find a few cans of beans on a shelf in one of the front offices. Carrying them up, I cut them open with my nails and Mr Crepsley and I tucked in. Harkat wasn't hungry - he could go for days on end without food if he had to.</p><p>The beans settled nicely in my stomach - cold as they were - and I lay back for an hour, quiet and thoughtful. We weren't in any rush. We had until midnight to rendezvous with Vancha (assuming he made it) and it would take us no more than a couple of hours to march through the tunnels to the cavern where we'd fought the vampaneze.</p><p>\"Do you think Steve escaped?\" I asked eventually.</p><p>\"I am sure of it,\" Mr Crepsley replied. \"That one has the luck of a demon, and the cunning to match.\"</p><p>\"He killed people - police and nurses - while he was escaping,\" I said.</p><p>Mr Crepsley sighed. \"I did not think he would attack those who helped him. I would have killed him before we were taken into custody if I had known what he was planning.\"</p><p>\"How do you think he got to be so vicious?\" I asked. \"He wasn't like this when I knew him.\"</p><p>\"Yes, he was,\" Mr Crepsley disagreed. \"He just had not grown into his true evil self yet. He was born bad, as certain people are. Humans will tell you that everybody can be helped, that everyone has a choice. In my experience, that is not so. Good people can sometimes choose badness, but bad people cannot choose good.\"</p><p>\"I don't believe that,\" Harkat said softly. \"I think good and evil exist - in all of us. We might be born leaning more towards - one than the other, but the choice is there. Ithas to be. Otherwise, we're mere - puppets of fate.\"</p><p>\"Perhaps,\" Mr Crepsley grunted. \"Many see it as you do. But I do not think so. Most are born with the freedom of choice. But there are those who defy the rules, who are wicked from the beginning. Maybe theyare puppets of fate, born that way for a reason, to test the rest of us. I do not know. But natural monsters do exist. On that point, nothing you say can shake me. And Steve Leonard is one of them.\"</p><p>\"But then it isn't his fault,\" I said, frowning. \"If he was born bad, he isn't to blame for growing up evil.\"</p><p>\"No more than a lion is to blame for being a predator,\" Mr Crepsley agreed.</p><p>I thought about that. \"If that's the case, we shouldn't hate him - we should pity him.\"</p><p>Mr Crepsley shook his head. \"No, Darren. You should neither hate nor pity a monster - merely fear it, and do all in your power to make an end of it before it destroys you.\" Leaning forward, he rapped on the hard platform with his knuckles. \"But remember,\" he said sternly. \"When we venture down the tunnels tonight, Steve Leonard is not our primary enemy - the Lord of the Vampaneze is. If the chance to kill Leonard arises, by all means seize it. But if you have to choose between him and the Lord he serves, strike first for the latter. We must put our personal feelings aside and focus on our mission.\"</p><p>Harkat and I nodded in agreement with the vampire, but he wasn't finished. Pointing at me with a long, bony finger, he said, \"That also applies to Miss Hemlock.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I asked.</p><p>\"The vampaneze might taunt you with her,\" he said. \"We know they cannot kill us - only their Lord dare cut us down. So they may try to split us up, making it easier for them to capture us. It will hurt, but you must put all thoughts of Debbie aside until the quest to kill the Vampaneze Lord has been settled.\"</p><p>\"I don't know if I can do that,\" I said, eyes downcast.</p><p>Mr Crepsley stared hard at me, then dropped his gaze. \"You are a Prince,\" he said quietly. \"I cannot command you. If your heart leads you to Debbie, and it proves impossible to resist its call, you must follow. But I ask you to remember the vampires you serve, and what will happen to our clan if we fail.\"</p><p>I nodded soberly. \"I haven't forgotten. I'm just not sure, in the heat of the moment, if I'll be able to abandon her.\"</p><p>\"But you know that you should?\" he pressed. \"You understand how important your choice is?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I whispered.</p><p>\"That is enough,\" he said. \"I trust you to make the right choice.\"</p><p>I cocked an eyebrow. \"You sound more like Seba Nile with every passing year,\" I commented dryly. Seba was the vampire who'd taught Mr Crepsley the ways of the clan.</p><p>\"I will take that as a compliment,\" he smiled, then lay back, closed his eyes, and rested in silence, leaving me to think about Debbie and the Lord of the Vampaneze, and contemplate the desperate choice I might be called upon to make.</p><p>Chapter ELEVEN</p><p>MR CREPSLEY's ankle had improved vastly by the time we left the silo to face our destiny. His flesh was still a nasty shade of purple, but the worst of the swelling had died down. He tested the ankle as little as possible during our trek through the tunnels, but was able to stand unassisted when he had to.</p><p>There was no fuss about our descent into the menacing darkness. When the time came, we simply walked down the stairs of the silo, broke out through a boarded-up door, found a manhole, slipped beneath the streets and advanced. We didn't encounter any vampaneze or traps.</p><p>We said nothing during the journey. Each of us knew how serious this was, and the odds stacked against us. Victory was unlikely, and even if it came, escape seemed impossible. If we managed to kill the Lord of the Vampaneze, his followers would surely cut us down in revenge, their hands no longer tied by the prophecies of Mr Tiny. We were marching to our doom, and tongues have a tendency to seize up at such times, regardless of how brave you might be.</p>","<p>After a long, uneventful journey, we reached the newly built tunnels, dry and warm in comparison to the older links, and from there it was only a short walk to the cavern where we'd faced the vampaneze less than twenty-four hours ago.</p><p>Twenty-four hours - It felt like years!</p><p>Several burning candles were set in nooks around the walls, and their light revealed an apparently deserted cavern. The bodies of the vampaneze we'd killed the night before had been dragged away, though drying pools of their blood remained. The huge door at the other side of the cavern was closed.</p><p>\"Tread carefully,\" Mr Crepsley said, pausing at the entrance. \"Hold your weapons low and?\"</p><p>He stopped abruptly and his face fell. Clearing his throat, he said in a surprisingly meek voice, \"Did either of you bring a weapon?\"</p><p>\"Of course?\" I began, then stopped as suddenly as Mr Crepsley had, my hand flying to my waist, where my sword would normally be nesting. But not now. I'd abandoned it when I was arrested, and with all that had happened since then, it had never occurred to me to replace it.</p><p>\"Um - you're not going to believe this ?\" I mumbled.</p><p>\"You forgot too?\" Mr Crepsley groaned.</p><p>We looked appealingly at Harkat.</p><p>The Little Person shook his neckless grey head. \"Sorry.\"</p><p>\"Brilliant!\" Mr Crepsley snapped. \"The most important fight of our lives, and we come unarmed. What manner of fools are we?\"</p><p>\"The greatest who ever stalked the shadows of the night,\" said someone from within the cavern.</p><p>Freezing, we stared into the gloom, our fingers twitching helplessly by our sides. Then a head popped into view from above the doorway and our hearts sank back in our chests. \"Vancha!\" we cheered.</p><p>\"The one and only,\" grinned the Prince. He swung around from where he'd been hanging from the ceiling. Landing on his feet, he turned to greet us. Harkat and I hurried forward and embraced the scruffy, smelly man with the dyed green hair and animal hides. Vancha's huge eyes widened with surprise. Then his small mouth split into a smile. \"Sappy idiots,\" he chuckled, hugging us back. He stuck his arms out to Mr Crepsley. \"Haven'tyou got a hug for me, Larten, old buddy?\" he croaked.</p><p>\"You know where you can insert your hug,\" Mr Crepsley retorted.</p><p>\"Oh, the ingratitude,\" Vancha moaned, then let us go and took a step back, beckoning us forward into the cavern. \"Is it true what I overheard?\" he asked. \"You came without weapons?\"</p><p>\"We have had a difficult afternoon,\" Mr Crepsley sniffed, ears reddening.</p><p>\"It must have been the most bloody awful afternoon in history if you forgot to come armed to the scrap of the century,\" Vancha chuckled, then grew serious. \"Did you get away OK? Any unpleasantness?\"</p><p>\"Our breakout was relatively easy,\" Mr Crepsley said. \"There were some sticky moments along the way - it has been a long time since I had to flee a wrathful mob - but all things considered, we fared rather splendidly. Our captors, however, were not so fortunate ?\"</p><p>He told Vancha about Steve and the guards and nurses he'd killed. Vancha's red face - he'd been engaged in a private duel with the sun for many decades - darkened when he heard the news. \"That one is aptly nicknamed,\" he growled. \"If ever a human was bonded at the soul with a leopard, it's him. I just pray to the gods that I have a chance to slit his throat tonight.\"</p><p>\"You'll have to get in line,\" I said. Nobody laughed - they knew I wasn't joking.</p><p>\"Anyway,\" Vancha boomed, \"one point of order at a time. I don't mind taking the vampaneze on empty-handed - it's my preferred method of fighting - but you three will need more than your fists and feet if we're to stand any chance of getting out of this alive. Luckily, Uncle Vancha has been busy. Follow me.\"</p><p>Vancha led us to one of the darker corners of the cavern, where a small pile of weapons lay stacked next to a large, motionless figure.</p><p>\"Where did you get these?\" Harkat asked, jumping on the weapons before Mr Crepsley and I had a chance. Rooting through them, he found a jagged knife and a small double-headed axe, which he swung over his head, delighted.</p><p>\"The vampaneze left them when they were clearing their dead away,\" Vancha explained. \"I imagine they assumed we'd come armed. If they knew how empty-headed you lot were, they'd have taken more care.\"</p><p>Ignoring the Prince's jibes, Mr Crepsley and I picked through the pile. He took a couple of long knives and afew shorter ones for throwing. I found a small curved sword I liked the feel of. I tucked a knife into the back of my trousers, for back-up, and then I was ready.</p><p>\"What's that?\" Harkat asked, nodding at the large figure on the ground.</p><p>\"My guest,\" Vancha said, and rolled the figure over.</p><p>The pale white face of a bound, gagged, enraged Chief Inspector Alice Burgess came into view. \"Urfl guffle snurf!\" she shouted into the folds of her gag, and I'm certain she wasn't saying hello or wishing us well!</p><p>\"What's she doing here?\" I snapped.</p><p>\"She was company for me,\" Vancha smirked. \"Besides, I didn't know what to expect when I returned. If the police had taken to the tunnels and sewers, I might have needed her to trade my way past.\"</p><p>\"What do you plan to do with her now?\" Mr Crepsley asked coolly.</p><p>\"I'm not sure,\" Vancha frowned, crouching to study the Chief Inspector. \"I tried explaining things to her while we were passing the day away in a forest a few miles outside the city, but I don't think she believed me. In fact, by what she told me to do with my tales of vampires and vampaneze, Iknow she didn't!\" The Prince paused. \"Having said that, she'd be a great one to have on our side. We may have need of an extra pair of hands in the battle ahead.\"</p><p>\"Could we trust her?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" Vancha said. \"But there's one way to find out.\"</p><p>Vancha started to undo the knots of the Chief Inspector's gag. He stopped on the final knot and addressed her sternly. \"I'm only going to say this once, so pay attention. I'm sure your first impulse when I free you will be to scream and curse and tell us what trouble we're in. And when you're on your feet, weapon in hand, you might feel like taking a stab at us and setting off by yourself.</p><p>\"Don't!\" His eyes were grim. \"I know what you think of us, but you're wrong. We didn't kill your people. We're out to stop the killers. If you want to put an end to the torment, come with us and fight. You've nothing to gain by attacking us. Even if you don't believe that, act as if you do. Otherwise, I'll leave you here, trussed up like a turkey.\"</p>","<p>\"Animal!\" the Chief Inspector spat, as Vancha removed her gag. \"I'll see you hang for this, all of you. I'll have you shaved bald, smeared with tar, covered with feathers, then set alight as you dangle!\"</p><p>\"Isn't she magnificent?\" Vancha beamed, freeing her legs and arms. \"She's been like that all afternoon. I think I'm falling in love.\"</p><p>\"Savage!\" she shouted, and struck out at him.</p><p>Vancha caught her arm and held it in mid air, his expression grave. \"Remember what I said, Alice? I don't want to leave you here, at the mercy of our enemies, but I will if you force me to.\"</p><p>The Chief Inspector glared at him, then turned her head aside, disgusted, and held her tongue.</p><p>\"Better,\" Vancha said, letting go. \"Now, pick a weapon - two or three if you'd prefer - and get ready. We've an army of darkness to deal with.\"</p><p>The Chief Inspector gazed around at us uncertainly. \"You guys arecrazy ,\" she muttered. \"You really expect me to believe you're vampires, but not killers? That you're here to take on a bunch of - what did you call them?\"</p><p>\"Vampaneze,\" Vancha said cheerfully.</p><p>\"That these vampaneze are the bad guys and you're here to sort them out, even though there's dozens of them and only four of you?\"</p><p>\"That's about the sum of it,\" Vancha smirked, \"except there's five of us now, which should make all the difference.\"</p><p>\"Crazy,\" she growled, but bent and picked up a long hunting knife, tested it, and gathered together another few knives. \"OK,\" she said, standing. \"I don't believe your story, but I'll tag along for the time being. If we run into these vampaneze, and they're all that you say, I'll throw my lot in with you. If we don't ?\" She pointed at Vancha's throat with the largest of her knives and jerked it sharply to one side.</p><p>\"I love it when you talk threateningly,\" Vancha laughed, then checked that we were all prepared, pulled his belts of shurikens tight around his chest, and led us forward in search of the vampaneze lair.</p><p>Chapter TWELVE</p><p>WE DIDN'Tget very far before running into our first obstacle. The huge door leading out of the cavern was bolted shut and wouldn't open. It was the type of door you find on walk-in safes in banks. There was a long row of combination locks running across the middle, beneath a circular handle.</p><p>\"I wrestled with this for more than an hour,\" Vancha said, tapping the row of small lock windows. \"Couldn't make head nor tail of it.\"</p><p>\"Let me have a look,\" Mr Crepsley said, stepping forward. \"I am not adept at locks such as these, but I have broken into safes before. I may be able to ?\" He trailed off, studied the locks a minute, then cursed foully and kicked the door.</p><p>\"Something wrong?\" I asked lightly.</p><p>\"We cannot go this way,\" he snapped. \"It is too intricately coded. We must find a way around.\"</p><p>\"Easier said than done,\" Vancha replied. \"I've scoured the cavern for hidden passages and tunnels - didn't find any. This place has been purpose-built. I think this is the only way ahead.\"</p><p>\"What about the ceiling?\" I asked. \"The vampaneze came that way the last time we were down here.\"</p><p>\"There are removable panels in the roof of the cavern,\" Vancha said, \"but the space above them is only accessible from down here, not through the tunnel.\"</p><p>\"Couldn't we break through the wall - around the door?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"I tried,\" Vancha said, nodding at a hole he'd punched out a few metres to our left. \"It's steel-lined.Thick steel. Even vampires have their limits.\"</p><p>\"This doesn't make sense,\" I grumbled. \"They knew we'd come. Theywant us to come. Why strand us here? There must be a way through.\" I knelt and examined the rows of tiny windows, each of which contained two numbers. \"Explain this lock to me,\" I said to Mr Crepsley.</p><p>\"It is a combination lock. Quite straightforward. The dials are down there.\" He pointed to a series of thin dials beneath the windows. \"You twist them clockwise for a higher number, anti-clockwise for a lower number. When the correct numbers have been entered in all fifteen windows, the door will open.\"</p><p>\"And each number's different?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I assume so.\" He sighed. \"Fifteen different locks, fifteen different numbers. I could crack the code eventually, but it would take several nights and days.\"</p><p>\"It doesn't make sense,\" I said again, staring at the meaningless numbers in the windows. \"Steve helped design this trap. He wouldn't have built something we couldn't get past. There must be ?\" I stopped. The last three windows were blank. I pointed them out to Mr Crepsley and asked why.</p><p>\"They must not form part of the code,\" he said.</p><p>\"So we've only twelve numbers to worry about?\"</p><p>He smiled ruefully. \"That should save us half a night or so.\"</p><p>\"Why twelve?\" I thought aloud, then closed my eyes and tried to think as Steve might (not a pleasant experience!). He'd exercised great patience in tricking us and setting us up for a fall, but now that we were close to the end, I couldn't picture him placing a boulder in our path which would take a week to remove. He'd be eager to get at us. The code he picked must be one we'd be able to crack pretty quickly, so it had to be simple, something which looked impossible, but in reality was as plain as ?</p><p>I groaned, then began counting. \"Try these numbers as I call them out,\" I said to Mr Crepsley, eyes still closed. \"Nineteen - Twenty - Five ?\"</p><p>I carried on until I got to \"Eighteen - Four.\" I stopped and opened my eyes. Mr Crepsley spun the last counter anti-clockwise to four. There was a click and the circular handle popped out. Startled, the vampire grabbed it and twisted. It turned easily at his touch and the round door swung open.</p><p>Mr Crepsley, Harkat and Vancha stared at me, awed.</p><p>\"How ??\" Vancha gasped.</p><p>\"Oh, please!\" Alice Burgess snorted. \"Isn't it obvious? He just converted the alphabet into numbers, starting with one and finishing with twenty-six. It's the most simplistic code in operation. A child could work it out.\"</p><p>\"Oh,\" Harkat said. \"I get it now. A was 1, B was - 2, and so on.\"</p><p>\"Right,\" I smiled. \"Using that code, I dialled in 'Steve Leopard'. I knew it had to be something easy like that.\"</p>","<p>\"Isn't education wonderful, Larten?\" Vancha smirked. \"We'll have to attend night classes when this is over.\"</p><p>\"Quiet!\" Mr Crepsley snapped, not amused. He was gazing into the darkness of the tunnel beyond. \"Remember where we are and who we are facing.\"</p><p>\"You can't talk to a Prince like that,\" Vancha grumbled, but straightened up and focused on the stretch of tunnel ahead. \"Get in line,\" he said, moving to take the lead. \"I'll go first, Harkat second, Alice in the middle, Darren behind, Larten at the rear.\"</p><p>Nobody argued with him. Though I was of equal rank, Vancha was far more experienced, and there was no doubt as to who was in charge.</p><p>Entering the tunnel, we advanced. Though the ceiling wasn't high, the tunnel was wide, and we were able to walk quite comfortably. Torches were set in the walls at regular intervals. I looked for tunnels leading off this one, but couldn't see any. We pressed on straight ahead.</p><p>We'd gone maybe forty metres when a sharp, clanging noise behind made us jump. Turning swiftly, we saw someone standing by the door we'd just come through. When he stepped forward into the light of the closest torch, hooks held up above his head, we knew instantly who it was ?R. V .!</p><p>\"Lady and gentlemen!\" he boomed. \"Welcome! The proprietors of the Cavern of Retribution wish you well and hope you enjoy your stay. If you've any complaints, please don't hesitate to?\"</p><p>\"Where's Debbie, you monster?\" I screamed, trying to shove past Mr Crepsley. The vampire held me back with a firm arm and shook his head tautly.</p><p>\"Remember what we discussed in the silo,\" he hissed.</p><p>I struggled a moment, then stepped back and glared at the insane vampaneze, who was jumping about from foot to foot, laughing crazily.</p><p>\"Where is she?\" I snarled.</p><p>\"Not far from here,\" he chuckled, his voice carrying in the close confines of the tunnel. \"Quite close as the crow flies. Closer still as the crowdies .\"</p><p>\"That's a lousy pun,\" Harkat shouted.</p><p>\"I ain't a poet but I don't know it,\" R.V. tossed back in reply. Then he stopped dancing and stared at us coldly. \"Debbie's close, man,\" he hissed. \"And she's alive. But she won't be much longer, not if you don't come with me now, Shan. Leave your rotten friends and surrender yourself to me - I'll let her go. Stay with them and pursue your hateful quest ?I'll kill her!\"</p><p>\"If you do ?\" I growled.</p><p>\"What?\" he jeered. \"You'll kill me too? You'll have to catch me first, Shanny boy, and that's a lot easier said than done. R.V.'s quick on his feet, yes indeedy, quick as a gazelle.\"</p><p>\"He sounds so much like Murlough,\" Mr Crepsley whispered, referring to a mad vampaneze we'd killed many years earlier. \"It is as if his spirit has survived and found a home inside R.V.\"</p><p>I'd no time to worry about spirits of the past. As I thought over the offer, R.V. darted to a hole on his left - it had been covered by as panel when we passed it - ducked into it, then stuck his head out, grinning wildly. \"How about it, Shanny? Your life for Debbie's. Is it a deal or do I make her squeal?\"</p><p>This was my moment of truth. I'd have given my life gladly if it meant sparing Debbie's. But if the Lord of the Vampaneze got the better of us, he'd lead his people to victory over the vampires. My duty was to those who'd placed their faith in me. I had more than myself to think about. And though it pained me intensely, I lowered my head in response to R.V.'s offer and said softly, \"No.\"</p><p>\"What was that?\" R.V. shouted. \"Speak up - I can't hear you.\"</p><p>\"NO!\" I roared, whipping out my knife and launching it at him, although I knew I couldn't hit him from where I was standing.</p><p>R.V.'s face twisted with hate. \"Cretin!\" he snarled. \"The others said you wouldn't trade for her, but I was sure you would. Very well. Have it your way, man. It's Debbie stew for breakfast!\"</p><p>Laughing at me, he withdrew and slammed the panel shut on the passageway. I wanted to run after him, pound on the panel and scream for him to bring Debbie back. But I knew he wouldn't, so I restrained myself - just.</p><p>\"You did well, Darren,\" Mr Crepsley said, laying a hand on my shoulder.</p><p>\"I did what had to be done,\" I sighed, taking no pleasure from his compliment.</p><p>\"Was that one of those vampaneze you've been talking about?\" Burgess asked, visibly shaken.</p><p>\"That's one of our ruby-lipped boys, sure enough,\" Vancha replied chirpily.</p><p>\"Are they all like that?\" she asked, eyes wide, white hair frizzy with fright.</p><p>\"Oh, no,\" Vancha said, faking an innocent look. \"Most are far worse!\"</p><p>Then the Prince winked, faced front, and moved on, leading us further down the throat-like tunnel, into the stomach of the vampaneze's monstrous trap, where destiny and death were lying in wait.</p><p>Chapter THIRTEEN</p><p>THE TUNNELran straight and downwards for five or six hundred metres, before opening out on to a huge, man-made cavern with smooth walls and an extremely high ceiling. Three heavy silver chandeliers hung from the ceiling, each adorned with dozens of thick, red, burning candles.</p><p>As we entered the cavern I saw that it was oval in shape, wide across the middle, narrowing at either end. There was a platform set close in front of the wall across from us, suspended on sturdy steel pillars, fifteen metres high. We drifted towards it, weapons poised, spreading out to form an orderly line, Vancha slightly in front, his eyes flicking left, right, upwards, searching for vampaneze.</p><p>\"Hold it,\" Vancha said as we approached the platform. We stopped instantly. I thought he'd seen a vampaneze, but he was gazing down at the ground, puzzled but not alarmed. \"Have a look at this,\" he murmured, beckoning us forward.</p><p>Stepping up beside him, I felt my insides turn to ice. We were standing on the edge of a pit - oval like the cavern - which was filled with steel-tipped stakes two or three metres tall. It reminded me of the pit in the Hall of Death in Vampire Mountain, only this was much bigger.</p><p>\"A trap for us to fall - into?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"I doubt it,\" Vancha said. \"The vampaneze would have covered it over if they wanted us to walk into it.\" He looked up. The platform was built directly over the pit, the support pillars rising from among the stakes. Now that we were close, we could see a long plank connecting the rear right of the platform to a hole in the wall behind it. There was also a thick rope running from the front left side of the platform to our side of the pit, where it was tied to a large holding stake.</p>","<p>\"Looks like that's the only way forward,\" I noted, not liking the set-up one little bit.</p><p>\"We could skirt the pit and climb the wall,\" Mr Crepsley suggested.</p><p>Vancha shook his head. \"Look again,\" he said.</p><p>I peered closely at the wall, as did Mr Crepsley. He saw what we were looking for just before I did and growled something foul beneath his breath.</p><p>\"What is it?\" Harkat asked, his round green eyes not as sharp as ours.</p><p>\"There are scores of tiny holes in the wall,\" I said. \"Ideal for firing darts or bullets through.\"</p><p>\"They'd cut us down in seconds if we tried climbing it,\" Vancha said.</p><p>\"That's dumb,\" Chief Inspector Burgess muttered. We looked back at her. \"Why lay a trap here and not in the tunnel?\" she asked. \"The walls of the tunnel could have been peppered with holes like that one. We had nowhere to turn, nowhere to run. We were sitting ducks. Why leave it till now?\"</p><p>\"Because it isn't a trap,\" Vancha told her. \"It's a warning. They don't want us going that way. They want us to use the platform.\"</p><p>The police chief frowned. \"I thought they wanted to kill you.\"</p><p>\"They do,\" Vancha said, \"but they want to play with us first.\"</p><p>\"Dumb,\" she muttered again, clutching her knife close to her chest, turning slowly to survey the whole of the cavern, as though she expected demons to dart from the walls and floor.</p><p>\"You smell that?\" Mr Crepsley asked, his nose wrinkling.</p><p>\"Petrol,\" I nodded. \"It's coming from the pit.\"</p><p>\"Perhaps we should move back,\" Vancha suggested, and we quickly withdrew without need of further prompting.</p><p>We examined the rope tethered to the stake. It was thickly woven and taut, professionally tied. Vancha tested it by crawling a few metres along, while we stood with our weapons drawn, covering him.</p><p>The Prince looked thoughtful when he returned. \"It's strong,\" he said. \"I think it would support all of us at the same time. But we won't chance it. We'll cross one at a time, the same order as we came through the tunnel.\"</p><p>\"What about the platform?\" Harkat asked. \"It could be rigged to - collapse when we are on it.\"</p><p>Vancha nodded. \"When I get up, I'll hurry to the opening across the plank. Don't come up until I'm safe. When you do, make straight for the tunnel. The same goes for the rest of you. If they take the platform down while we're crossing, only one of us will die.\"</p><p>\"Great,\" the Chief Inspector snorted. \"So I've a one infive chance of making it across alive.\"</p><p>\"Those are good odds,\" Vancha said. \"Much better than those we'll be facing when the vampaneze make their move.\"</p><p>Vancha made sure his shurikens were strapped tight, grabbed hold of the rope, shimmied up it a few metres, then swung over on to his back, so he was hanging upside-down. He started across, hand over hand, foot over foot. The rope cut up at a steep angle, but the Prince was strong and his pace didn't falter.</p><p>He was almost halfway across, dangling over the pit of deadly stakes, when a figure appeared in the mouth of the tunnel. Burgess spotted it first. \"Hey!\" she shouted, raising a hand to point. \"Someone's up there!\"</p><p>Our eyes - and Vancha's - snapped to the tunnel entrance. The light was poor, and it was impossible to tell if the figure was big or small, male or female. Then it stepped forward on to the plank and the mystery was solved.</p><p>\"Steve!\" I hissed, eyes filling with hatred.</p><p>\"Howdy, boys!\" the half-vampaneze boomed, striding across the plank, not in the least bit afraid of falling and impaling himself on the stakes beneath. \"Find your way here OK? I was expecting you ages ago. Thought you might have got lost. I was preparing a search party to send after you.\"</p><p>Steve reached the platform and walked to the waist-high railing which ran around the sides. He peered down at Vancha and beamed as though welcoming an old friend. \"We meet again, Mr March,\" he chuckled, waving sarcastically.</p><p>Vancha snarled like an animal and began crawling faster than before. Steve watched, amused, then reached into a pocket, produced a match and held it up for our eyes to fix on. He winked, bent and struck the match on the floor of the platform. He cupped it close to his face a moment, while it flared into life, then casually tossed it over the railing - into the petrol-soaked pit.</p><p>There was an explosive roar which almost burst my ear drums. Flames shot up out of the pit like huge, fiery fingers. They billowed over the edges of the platform, but didn't threaten Steve - he laughed through the red and yellow wall of fire. The flames scorched the roof and wall to the rear - and completely consumed the rope and Vancha, swallowing the Prince whole in the blink of a flame-filled eye.</p><p>Chapter FOURTEEN</p><p>IDARTEDforward impulsively when I saw Vancha disappear amidst the flames, but was quickly forced back by the waves of fire which rolled down towards me. As they broke upon the floor of the cavern, or spat themselves out in the air above our heads, the sound of Steve Leopards laughter filled my ears. Shielding my eyes with my hands, I glanced up at the platform and saw him leaping about, a heavy sword held high above his head, cheering and whooping with wicked glee. \"Bye-bye, Vancha!\" he hollered. \"So long, Mr March! Adios, Princey! Farewell, vam?\"</p><p>\"Don't write my death-notices yet, Leonard!\" a voice roared from within the blanket of fire, and as Steve's face dropped, the flames died down slightly, revealing a singed, blackened, but very much alive Vancha March, hanging by one hand from the rope, furiously slapping out flames in his hair and animal hides with the other.</p><p>\"Vancha!\" I yelled, delighted. \"You're alive!\"</p><p>\"Of course I am,\" he replied, grinning painfully as he extinguished the last of the flames.</p><p>\"You're a tough old badger, aren't you?\" Steve remarked sourly, glaring down at the Prince.</p><p>\"Aye,\" Vancha growled, a gleam in his eye. \"And you haven't seen anything yet - just wait till I get my hands on your scrawny, evil neck!\"</p><p>\"I'msoooo scared,\" Steve snorted. Then, as Vancha began climbing again, he hurried to the end of the platform where the rope was tied and tapped it with his sword. \"No you don't,\" he chortled. \"One more centimetre and I'll send you crashing to your doom.\"</p><p>Vancha stopped and studied Steve and the stretch of rope left to cross, calculating the odds. Steve chuckled dryly. \"Come off it, March. Even an oaf like you knows when he's beaten. I don't want to cut this rope - not yet - but if I set my mind to it, there's nothing you can do to stop me.\"</p>","<p>\"We'll see about that,\" Vancha growled, then ripped a throwing star loose and sent it flying at the half-vampaneze.</p><p>Steve didn't flinch as the shuriken buried itself harmlessly in the underbelly of the steel platform. \"The angle isn't right,\" he yawned, unimpressed. \"You can't hit me from there, no matter how fine a shot you are. Now, will you slide down and join your friends on the ground, or do I have to get nasty?\"</p><p>Vancha spat at Steve - his spit falling long short of its target - then tucked his arms and legs around the rope and quickly slid over the heads of the flames, away from the platform, to where we were waiting.</p><p>\"Wise move,\" Steve said as Vancha steadied himself on his feet and we checked his back and hair for smouldering embers.</p><p>\"If I had a gun,\" Burgess muttered, \"I could take that wiseass out.\"</p><p>\"You're starting to see things from our point of view,\" Vancha noted wryly.</p><p>\"I'm still undecided about you lot,\" the Chief Inspector replied, \"but I know out-and-out evil when I see it.\"</p><p>\"Now then,\" Steve announced loudly, \"if we're all good and ready, let's get this show on the road.\" Sticking two fingers between his lips, he whistled loudly three times. Above us, panels in the ceiling were ripped free, and vampaneze and vampets descended on ropes. Similar panels were removed in the walls of the cavern and more of our enemies stepped through and advanced. I counted twenty - thirty - forty - more. Most were armed with swords, axes and clubs, but a few of the vampets carried rifles, handguns and crossbows.</p><p>We backed up to the edge of the pit as the vampaneze and vampets closed on us, so they couldn't attack us from behind. We stared at the ranks of grim-faced soldiers, counting silently, hopes fading as we realized how hopelessly overwhelmed we were.</p><p>Vancha cleared his throat. \"I make it about ten or twelve for each of us,\" he commented. \"Does anybody have any favourites, or will we divide them up at random?\"</p><p>\"You can take as many as you want,\" I said, spotting a familiar face in the middle of the crowd to my left, \"but leave that guy over there for me.\"</p><p>Chief Inspector Burgess gasped when she saw who I was pointing at. \"Morgan James?\"</p><p>\"Evening, ma'am,\" the sharp-eyed policeman/vampet saluted her mockingly. He'd changed out of his uniform. He was now wearing the brown shirt and black trousers of the vampets, and he'd daubed red circles of blood around his eyes.</p><p>\"Morgan's one ofthem !\" the Chief Inspector asked, shocked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said. \"He helped me escape. He knew that Steve would murder his colleagues - and he let him.\"</p><p>Her face darkened. \"Shan,\" she growled, \"if you want him, you'll have to fight me for him - that bastard'smine !\"</p><p>I turned to argue with her, saw the fierce glow in her eyes, and relented with a nod.</p><p>The vampaneze and vampets stopped about three metres short of us and stood, swinging their weapons, eyes alert, awaiting the order to attack. On the platform, Steve grunted happily, then clapped his hands. Out of the corner of my eye I saw somebody appear in the mouth of the tunnel behind us. Glancing over my shoulder, I realized two people had emerged and were crossing the plank to the platform. Both were familiar - Gannen Harst and the Lord of the Vampaneze!</p><p>\"Look!\" I hissed at my companions.</p><p>Vancha moaned aloud when he saw the pair, turned quickly, drew three of his shurikens, took aim and fired. The range wasn't a problem, but the angle - as when he was on the rope and firing at Steve - wasn't favourable, and the stars struck and bounced off the underside of the platform.</p><p>\"Greetings, brother,\" Gannen Harst said, nodding at Vancha.</p><p>\"We've got to get up there!\" Vancha snapped, looking for a way forward.</p><p>\"If you can lead, I will gladly follow,\" Mr Crepsley said.</p><p>\"The rope ?\" Vancha began, but stopped when he saw a group of vampaneze standing between us and the stake where the rope was tied. Even the wild, ever optimistic Prince knew there was no way through so many foes. If the element of surprise had been on our side, we might have battled through them, but after our last encounter they were prepared for mindless, lightning attacks.</p><p>\"Even if we made the - rope,\" Harkat said, \"those on the platform could cut it before - we got across.\"</p><p>\"So what do we do?\" Vancha growled, frustrated.</p><p>\"Die?\" Mr Crepsley suggested.</p><p>Vancha winced. \"I don't fear death,\" he said, \"but I won't rush to embrace it. We aren't finished yet. We wouldn't be standing here talking if we were - they'd have rushed us by now. Cover me.\" So saying, he turned to address the trio on the platform, who were now standing side by side, close to the plank.</p><p>\"Gannen!\" Vancha shouted. \"What's going on? Why haven't your men attacked us yet?\"</p><p>\"You know why,\" Harst responded. \"They're afraid they might kill you in the heat of battle. According to Desmond Tiny, only our Lord is supposed to kill the hunters.\"</p><p>\"Does that mean they won't defend themselves if we attack?\" Vancha asked.</p><p>Steve barked a laugh. \"Dream on, you stupid old?\"</p><p>\"Enough!\" Gannen Harst shouted, silencing the half-vampaneze. \"You will not interrupt when I am speaking with my brother.\" Steve glowered at the protector of the Vampaneze Lord, then lowered his head and held his tongue.</p><p>\"Of course they'll defend themselves,\" Harst said, facing Vancha again, \"but we hope to avoid such a scene. Apart from the risk of killing you, we've lost too many good men already and don't wish to sacrifice any more. It might be possible to agree a compromise.\"</p><p>\"I'm listening,\" Vancha said.</p><p>Gannen Harst gave Steve a quick look. Steve cupped his hands to his mouth and shouted at the ceiling, \"Lower away, R.V. !\"</p><p>There was a pause, then a panel in the ceiling was thrown back and somebody was lowered through the gap on a rope ?Debbie !</p><p>My heart lurched at the sight of her, and I raised my arms, as though I could reach across the great divide and grab her. She didn't appear to have suffered at the hands(hooks) of the insane R.V., though her forehead was gashed, her clothes were ripped, and she looked incredibly weary. Her hands were tied behind her back, but her legs were free, and she kicked out at Steve and the others as she came level with the platform. They only laughed, and R.V. lowered her another metre, so she was too low to aim at them.</p>","<p>\"Debbie!\" I shouted desperately.</p><p>\"Darren!\" she screamed. \"Get out! Don't trust them! They let Steve and R.V. do as they please. They even take orders from them. Flee quick before?\"</p><p>\"If you don't shut up,\" Steve snarled, \"I'll shut you up.\" He stretched the flat of his sword out and touched it to the thin rope tied around her middle - which was all that lay between Debbie and a deadly drop into the pit.</p><p>Debbie saw the peril she was in and bit down on her tongue.</p><p>\"Good,\" Gannen Harst said when silence had returned. \"Now - our offer. We are interested only in the hunters. Debbie Hemlock, Alice Burgess and the Little Person don't matter. We have you outnumbered, Vancha. Our victory is assured. You cannot win, only injure us, and perhaps foil us by dying at the hands of one who isn't our Lord.\"</p><p>\"That'll be good enough for me,\" Vancha sniffed.</p><p>\"Perhaps,\" Harst nodded. \"And I'm sure Larten Crepsley and Darren Shan feel the same. But what of the others? Will they give their lives so freely, for the sake of the vampire clan?\"</p><p>\"I will!\" Harkat boomed.</p><p>Gannen Harst smiled. \"I expect you would, grey one. But you don't have to. Nor do the women. If Vancha, Larten and Darren lay down their weapons and surrender, we'll free the rest of you. You can walk away, lives intact.\"</p><p>\"No way!\" Vancha shouted immediately. \"I wouldn't roll over and die at the best of times - I'm certainly not doing it now, when so much is at stake.\"</p><p>\"Nor shall I agree to such a deal,\" Mr Crepsley said.</p><p>\"What of Darren Shan?\" Harst asked. \"Will he agree to our deal, or will he condemn his friends to die with the rest of you?\"</p><p>All eyes fixed on me. I gazed up at Debbie, dangling on the rope, frightened, bloodied, desolate. I had it in my power to set her free. Cut a deal with the vampaneze, face a quick death instead of perhaps a slow, painful one, and save the life of the woman I loved. It would have been inhuman of me to reject such a deal?</p><p>?but Iwasn't human. I was a half-vampire. More - a Vampire Prince. And Princes don't cut deals, not when the fate of their people is at stake. \"No,\" I said miserably. \"We fight and we die. All for one and one for all.\"</p><p>Gannen Harst nodded understandingly. \"I expected that, but one should always open with a weak offer. Very well - let me put another proposal to you. Same basic outline as the first. Drop your weapons, surrender, and we let the humans walk. Only this time, Darren Shan gets to go head to head with our Lord and Steve Leonard.\"</p><p>Vancha's face creased suspiciously. \"What are you talking about?\"</p><p>\"If you and Larten turn yourselves over to us without a fight,\" Harst said, \"we will allow Darren to duel with our Lord and Steve Leonard. It will be two on one, but he'll be equipped with weapons. If Darren wins, we free all three of you along with the others. If he loses, we execute you and Larten, but the humans and Harkat Mulds go free.</p><p>\"Think it over,\" he urged us. \"It's a good, honest deal, more than you could have reasonably hoped for.\"</p><p>Vancha turned away from the platform, troubled, and looked to Mr Crepsley for advice. The vampire, for once, didn't know what to say, and merely shook his head mutely.</p><p>\"What doyou think?\" Vancha asked me.</p><p>\"There has to be a catch,\" I muttered. \"Why risk their Lord's life if they don't have to?\"</p><p>\"Gannen wouldn't lie,\" Vancha said. His face hardened. \"But he mightn't tell us the whole truth. Gannen!\" he roared. \"What guarantee do you give that it'll be a fair fight? How do we know that R.V. or the others won't join in?</p><p>\"I give my word,\" Gannen Harst said softly. \"Only the pair on the platform with me will fight Darren Shan. Nobody else will interfere. I'll kill any who seeks to swing the balance one way or the other.\"</p><p>\"That's good enough for me,\" Vancha said. \"I believe him. But is this the way we want to go? We've never seen their Lord fight, so we don't know what he's capable of - but we know Leonard's a sly, dangerous opponent. The two of them together ?\" He grimaced.</p><p>\"If we agree to Gannen's deal,\" Mr Crepsley said, \"and send Darren up to face them, we place all our eggs in one basket. If Darren wins - wonderful. But if he loses...</p><p>Mr Crepsley and Vancha gazed long and hard at me.</p><p>\"Well, Darren?\" Mr Crepsley asked. \"It is an enormous burden to take upon yourself. Are you prepared to shoulder such a solemn responsibility?\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" I sighed. \"I still think there's a catch. If the odds were fifty-fifty, I'd jump at it. But I don't think they are. I believe ?\" I stopped. \"But that doesn't matter. If this is our best chance, we have to grab it. If you two trust me, I'll accept the challenge - and the blame if I fail.\"</p><p>\"He said that like a true vampire,\" Vancha noted warmly.</p><p>\"He is a true vampire,\" Mr Crepsley replied, and I felt pride bloom burningly within me.</p><p>\"Very well,\" Vancha shouted. \"We accept. But first you have to set the humans and Harkat free. After that, Darren fights your Lord and Steve. Only then, if the fight is fair and he loses, will Larten and I lay down our arms.\"</p><p>\"That's not the deal,\" Harst replied stiffly. \"You must lay your weapons to one side and surrender before?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Vancha interrupted. \"We do it this way or not at all. You have my word that we'll let your people take us if Darren loses - assuming he loses fairly. If my word's not good enough, we have a problem.\"</p><p>Gannen Harst hesitated, then nodded curtly. \"Your word is good,\" he said, then told R.V. to haul Debbie up and escort her down.</p><p>\"No!\" R.V. howled. \"Steve said I could kill her! He said I could cut her up into tiny little pieces and?\"</p><p>\"Now I'm saying different!\" Steve roared. \"Don't cross me on this. There'll be other nights and humans - plenty of them - but there's only one Darren Shan.\"</p><p>We heard R.V. grumbling, but then he pulled on the rope and Debbie ascended in a series of short, uncomfortable jerks.</p><p>While waiting for Debbie to be returned to us, I got ready for my fight with the pair on the platform, wiping my hands clean, checking my weapons, clearing my mind of all thoughts except those of battle.</p>","<p>\"How do you feel?\" Vancha asked.</p><p>\"Fine.\"</p><p>\"Remember,\" he said, \"all that matters is the result. Fight dirty if you have to. Kick and spit, scratch and pinch, hit below the belt.\"</p><p>\"I will,\" I grinned. Lowering my voice, I asked, \"Will you really surrender if I lose?\"</p><p>\"I gave my word, didn't I?\" Vancha said, then winked and whispered in a voice even lower than mine. \"I promised we'd drop our weapons and let them take us. And so we will. But I said nothing about letting them keep us or not picking our weapons up again!\"</p><p>The vampaneze ahead of us parted ranks as R.V. marched through, dragging Debbie behind him by her hair.</p><p>\"Stop that!\" I shouted angrily. \"You're hurting her!\"</p><p>R.V. bared his teeth and laughed. He was still wearing one red contact lens and hadn't replaced the one he'd lost the night before. His bushy beard was flecked with bits of moss, twigs, dirt and blood. It would have been easyto feel sorry for him - he'd been a decent man before he lost his hands to the jaws of the Wolf Man at the Cirque Du Freak - but I had no time for sympathy. I reminded myself that he was the enemy and erased all traces of pity from my mind.</p><p>R.V. tossed Debbie down in front of me. She cried out in pain, then lunged to her knees and flew into my arms. I clutched her close as she sobbed and tried to speak. \"Shhh,\" I said. \"Take it easy. You're safe. Don't say anything.\"</p><p>\"I - must,\" she wept. \"So much - to say. I - I love you, Darren.\"</p><p>\"Of course you do,\" I smiled, my eyes filling with tears.</p><p>\"Such a touching scene,\" Steve sneered. \"Someone pass me a hankie.\"</p><p>I ignored him and held Debbie's face away from me. I kissed her quickly, then smiled. \"You look awful,\" I said.</p><p>\"Charming!\" she half-laughed, then stared at me appealingly. \"I don't want to leave,\" she croaked. \"Not until after the fight.\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said quickly. \"You have to go. I don't want you to stay and watch.\"</p><p>\"In case you are killed?\" she asked.</p><p>I nodded, and her lips thinned almost to nothing.</p><p>\"I want to stay too,\" Harkat said, stepping up beside us, his green eyes filled with determination.</p><p>\"It's your right to,\" I agreed. \"I won't stop you. But I'd rather you didn't. If you value our friendship, you'll take Debbie and the Chief Inspector, lead them to the surface, and make sure they get away safely. I don't trust these monsters - they might go on a rampage and kill us all if I win.\"</p><p>\"Then I should stay to fight - with you,\" Harkat said.</p><p>\"No,\" I said softly. \"Not this time. Please, for my sake and Debbie's, will you leave?\"</p><p>Harkat didn't like it, but he nodded reluctantly.</p><p>\"Come on then,\" someone snapped behind us. \"Let's get them out if they're going.\"</p><p>I looked up and saw the treacherous police officer called Morgan James striding towards us. He was carrying a slim rifle, the butt of which he poked into his Chief Inspector's ribs.</p><p>\"Get the hell away from me!\" she snapped, turning on him furiously.</p><p>\"Easy, Chief,\" he drawled, grinning like a jackal, bringing up the rifle. \"I'd hate to have to shoot you.\"</p><p>\"When we get back, you're history,\" she snarled.</p><p>\"I won't be coming back,\" he smirked. \"I'll guide you lot to the cavern at the end of the tunnel, lock you out to make sure you can't create a disturbance, then take off with the others when the fighting's over.\"</p><p>\"You won't escape that easy,\" Burgess snorted. \"I'll track you down and make you pay for this, even if I have to travel halfway round the world.\"</p><p>\"Sure you will,\" Morgan laughed, then nudged her in the ribs again, harder this time.</p><p>The Chief Inspector spat at her ex-officer, then pushed him away and crouched next to Vancha to tie her laces. As she was doing that, she whispered to him out of the side of her mouth. \"The guy in the hood and cloak - that's the one you have to kill, right?\" Vancha nodded wordlessly, guarding his expression. \"I don't like the idea of sending the kid up to fight them,\" Burgess said. \"If I can create a bit of space, and provide firing cover, d'you reckon you or Crepsley could get up there?\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\" Vancha said, lips barely moving.</p><p>\"Then I'll see what I can do.\" Burgess finished tying her laces, stood and winked. \"Come on,\" she said aloud to Harkat and Debbie. \"The air stinks here. The sooner we're out, the better.\"</p><p>The Chief Inspector started walking, shoving ahead of Morgan, purpose in her stride. The rows of vampaneze ahead of her parted, clearing a path. Only a few now stood between us and the stake the rope was tied to.</p><p>Harkat and Debbie looked back at me sorrowfully. Debbie opened her mouth to say something, but words wouldn't come. Crying, she shook her head and turned her back on me, shoulders shaking miserably. Harkat put his arms around her and led her away, following the Chief Inspector.</p><p>Burgess was almost at the mouth of the tunnel leading out of the cavern when she paused and glanced over her shoulder. Morgan was close to her, cradling his rifle. Harkat and Debbie were several metres behind, progressing slowly.</p><p>\"Hurry up!\" Burgess snapped at the dawdling pair. \"This isn't a funeral procession!\"</p><p>Morgan smiled and looked back automatically at Harkat and Debbie. As he did, the Chief Inspector swung into action. Throwing herself at him, she grabbed the butt of the rifle and dug it into the soft flesh of his stomach, fast and hard, winding him. Morgan yelled in pain and surprise, then snatched the rifle back as she tried to pull it away. He almost wrenched it from her grasp, but not quite, and the pair rolled over on the ground, wrestling for the gun. Behind them, the vampaneze and vampets moved to intercept them.</p><p>Before the advancing troops reached her, Burgess got a finger on the trigger of the rifle and squeezed off a shot. It could have been pointing anywhere - she didn't have time to aim - but as luck had it, it was pointing at the jaw of the vampet she was struggling with - Morgan James!</p><p>There was a flash and a roar of gunfire. Then Morgan was falling away from the Chief Inspector, shrieking with agony, the left side of his face a bloody, shredded mess.</p><p>As Morgan surged to his feet, hands clutching the remains of his face, Burgess slammed him over the back of his head with the butt of the rifle, knocking him unconscious. Then, as vampaneze and vampets swarmed towards her, she leant a knee on the ex-officer's back, swung her rifle up, took careful aim, and fired off a volley of shots at the platform - at Steve, Gannen Harst - and the Lord of the Vampaneze!</p>","<p>Chapter FIFTEEN</p><p>BULLETS POUNDEDthe platform, railing, wall and ceiling. The three men caught in the line of fire clucked backwards quickly, but not quickly enough - one of the bullets struck the Vampaneze Lord high in his right shoulder, drawing an arc of blood and a sharp cry of pain!</p><p>At their Lord's cry, the vampaneze and vampets exploded with rage. Screaming and howling like mad animals, they launched themselvesen masse at the Chief Inspector, who was still firing. Barrelling over one another in their haste to be first upon her, they descended upon Burgess in a vicious, churning wave, breaking over Harkat and Debbie along the way.</p><p>My first instinct was to rush to Debbie and pull her from the crush, but Vancha grabbed me before I could move and pointed to the rope - it was no longer guarded.</p><p>I knew immediately that this was our first priority. Debbie would have to fend for herself.</p><p>\"Who goes?\" I gasped, as we hurried to the stake.</p><p>\"Me,\" Vancha said, grabbing the rope.</p><p>\"No,\" Mr Crepsley disagreed, laying a hand on the Prince's shoulder. \"It must be me.\"</p><p>\"We don't have time to?\" Vancha started.</p><p>\"That is true,\" Mr Crepsley interrupted. \"We do not have time. So let me pass without any arguments.\"</p><p>\"Larten ?\" Vancha growled.</p><p>\"He's right,\" I said softly. \"It has to be him.\"</p><p>Vancha gawped at me. \"Why?\"</p><p>\"Because Steve was my best friend and Gannen's your brother,\" I explained. \"Mr Crepsley's the only one who can concentrate wholly on the Vampaneze Lord. You or I would have one eye on Steve or Gannen, no matter how hard we tried to ignore them.\"</p><p>Vancha thought about that, nodded and let go of the rope, clearing the way for Mr Crepsley. \"Give them hell, Larten,\" he said.</p><p>\"I will,\" Mr Crepsley smiled. He took hold of the rope and started across.</p><p>\"We must cover him from this side,\" Vancha said, drawing a handful of shurikens and squinting up at the platform.</p><p>\"I know,\" I said, eyes on the thrashing vampaneze ahead of me, ready to combat them when they awoke to the threat of Mr Crepsley's challenge.</p><p>One of the trio on the platform must have spotted Mr Crepsley, because Vancha suddenly let fly with a couple of throwing stars - he had a clear shot at them from where we were standing - and I heard a curse above as whoever it was jumped back out of the way of the shurikens.</p><p>There was a pause, then a roar which filled the cavern and cut through the cries and mayhem of the battling vampaneze. \"Servants of the night!\" Gannen Harst bellowed. \"Look to your Lord! Danger approaches!\"</p><p>Heads turned and eyes fixed, first on the platform, then on the rope and Mr Crepsley. With fresh yelps and gasps, the vampaneze and vampets spun and rushed towards the spot where Vancha and I were standing.</p><p>If there hadn't been quite so many, they'd have mown us down, but their numbers worked against them. Too many attacked at the same time, resulting in confusion and chaos. So, instead of facing a solid wall of warriors, we were able to pick off individuals.</p><p>As I swung my sword wildly and Vancha lashed out with his hands, I spotted Gannen Harst stealing towards the end of the platform where the rope was tied, a sharp dagger in his right hand. It didn't take a genius to work out his intentions. I roared at Vancha, warning him, but there was no room for him to turn and throw. I shouted at Mr Crepsley to hurry up, but he was still a long way from safety and could go no faster than he was already going.</p><p>As Harst reached the rope and prepared to cut it, someone fired at him. He ducked low and rolled back out of the way as bullets turned the air red around him.</p><p>Standing on my toes, I spotted a bruised, battered, but still living Alice Burgess, on her feet, rifle in hand, quickly reloading it with bullets she'd snatched from Morgan James. Just ahead of her stood Harkat Mulds and Debbie Hemlock; Harkat wielding his axe, Debbie awkwardly swinging a short sword, both of them protecting the Chief Inspector from the handful of vampaneze and vampets who hadn't been drawn away to deal with the rope.</p><p>I felt like cheering aloud at the sight, and would have if a vampaneze hadn't crashed into my back and knocked me to the ground. As I rolled away from stomping feet, the vampaneze dived after me. Pinning me to the floor, he wrapped his fingers around my neck and squeezed. I lashed out at him but he had the beating of me - I was finished!</p><p>But the luck of the vampires was on my side. Before his fingers could close and crush my throat, one of his own men was punched by Vancha, fell back, collided with the vampaneze on top of me, and knocked him off. As he yelled, frustrated, I leapt to my feet, grabbed a mace which someone had dropped in the fighting, and let him have it full in the face. The vampaneze dropped, screaming, and I was back in the thick of the fighting.</p><p>I saw a vampet swing an axe at the rope tied to the stake. Roaring, I threw the mace at him, but too late - the head of the axe cut clean through the strands of the rope, severing it entirely.</p><p>My eyes darted to where Mr Crepsley was hanging, and my insides clenched as he swung down underneath the platform, through the red flames of the pit, which still burnt brightly.</p><p>It seemed to take an age for the rope to reach the length of its arc and swing back towards me. When it did, the vampire was no longer in sight, and my heart dropped. Then my eyes slid down and I realized he was still clinging to the rope, but had slipped a few metres. As flames licked the undersides of his feet, he began climbing again, and within a couple of seconds was clear of the fire and back on course for the platform.</p><p>A quick-minded vampet broke clear of the melee, raised a crossbow and fired at Mr Crepsley. He missed. Before he could fire again, I found a spear and sent it soaring. It struck him in the upper right arm and he fell to his knees, moaning.</p><p>I glanced to where Burgess was firing again, covering Mr Crepsley as he climbed. Debbie was struggling with a vampet twice her size. She'd thrown her arms around him so he couldn't use his sword and had buried a knife in the small of his back. She was raking his face with her nails, and putting her left knee to very naughty use. Not bad for an English teacher!</p><p>Harkat, meanwhile, was chopping vampaneze and vampets to pieces. The Little Person was an experienced, lethal fighter, much stronger and faster than he looked. Many vampaneze charged him, expecting to swat him to one side - none lived to write their memoirs.</p><p>Then, as Harkat dispatched another vampet with an almost casual swing of his axe, there was a loud, animal-like cry, and a furious R.V. entered the fray. He'd been trapped in the middle of a crowd of vampaneze, unable to join the fighting. Now at last he broke free, fixed on Harkat, and bore down upon him, hooks glinting and teeth gnashing. Tears of rage trickled from his mismatched eyes. \"Kill you!\" he roared. \"Kill you! Kill you! Kill!\"</p>","<p>He brought the hooks on his left hand down on Harkat's head, but the Little Person ducked out of the way and clubbed the hooks aside with the flat of his axe. R.V. swung his other set of hooks towards Harkat's stomach. Harkat brought his free hand down in the nick of time and caught R.V.'s arm above the elbow, stopping the tips of the hooks less than a centimetre from the flesh of his midriff. As R.V. screamed and spat at Harkat, the Little Person calmly grabbed the straps attaching the hooks to R.V.'s arm, ripped them loose and tossed the hook-hand away.</p><p>R.V. shrieked as though stabbed, and punched Harkat with the stump at the end of his elbow. Harkat took no notice, only reached up, caught hold of R.V.'s other hook-hand, and ripped that off too.</p><p>\"NO!!!\" R.V. screeched, diving after the hooks. \"My hands! My hands!\"</p><p>R.V. recovered the hooks, but couldn't strap them back on without help. He yelled at his comrades to assist him, but they had troubles of their own. He was still screaming when Alice Burgess lowered her rifle and stared at the platform. Turning to see what she was looking at, I saw Mr Crepsley climb over the railing, and I too relaxed.</p><p>All eyes gradually drifted to the platform and the battle died down. When people saw Mr Crepsley standing on the platform, they stopped fighting and fixed upon the scene, sensing as I did that our squabbles were no longer relevant - the only fight that mattered was the one about to take place overhead.</p><p>When everyone was still, a strange silence settled on us, which lasted a minute or more. Mr Crepsley stood at his end of the platform, impassive, while his three opponents stood just as sentry-like at theirs.</p><p>Finally, as the hairs on the back of my neck were beginning to lie down - they'd been standing up stiff since the start of the battle - the Lord of the Vampaneze stepped forward to the railing, lowered his hood, faced those of us on the ground, and spoke.</p><p>Chapter SIXTEEN</p><p>\"LET THEfighting cease,\" the Lord of the Vampaneze said in a low, unmelodramatic voice. \"There's no need for it now.\"</p><p>It was the first time I'd seen the Vampaneze Lord's face and I was surprised by how ordinary he looked. I'd built up a picture in my mind of a fierce, fiery, wild-eyed tyrant, whose gaze could turn water to steam. But this was just a man in his twenties or early thirties, normal build, light brown hair and rather sad eyes. The wound he'd received to his shoulder was minor - the blood had already dried - and he ignored it as he spoke.</p><p>\"I knew this was coming,\" the Lord of the Vampaneze said softly, turning his head to gaze at Mr Crepsley. \"Des Tiny predicted it. He said I'd have to fight one of the hunters here, above the flames, and that it would most likely be Larten Crepsley. We tried to turn his prophecy on its head and lure the boy up instead. For a while I thought we'd succeeded. But in my heart I knew it was you I'd have to face.\"</p><p>Mr Crepsley raised a sceptical eyebrow. \"Did Mr Tiny say which of us would triumph?\" he asked.</p><p>A thin smile broke across the Vampaneze Lord's lips. \"No. He said it could swing either way.\"</p><p>\"That is encouraging,\" Mr Crepsley said dryly.</p><p>Mr Crepsley held one of his knives up to catch the light of the chandelier high above his head, studying the blade. The instant he did that, Gannen Harst stepped in front of his Lord, defensively.</p><p>\"The deal's off,\" Harst said gruffly. \"The two to one ratio no longer applies. If you'd sent Darren Shan as agreed, we'd have kept our side of the bargain. Since you've come in his place, you can't expect us to offer the same generous odds.\"</p><p>\"I expect nothing of madmen and traitors,\" Mr Crepsley said archly, causing the vampaneze and vampets in the cavern to mutter darkly.</p><p>\"Take heed,\" Gannen Harst snarled, \"or I'll?\"</p><p>\"Peace, Gannen,\" said the Lord of the Vampaneze. \"The time for threats has passed. Let us lock weapons and wits without any further rancour.\"</p><p>The Vampaneze Lord stepped out from behind Gannen Harst and produced a barbed short sword. Harst drew a longer, straight sword, while Steve whistled merrily and dug out a gold dagger and long length of spiked chain.</p><p>\"Are you ready, Larten Crepsley?\" the Vampaneze Lord asked. \"Have you made your peace with the gods?\"</p><p>\"I did that long ago,\" Mr Crepsley said, both knives in his hands, his eyes alert. \"But, before we begin, I would like to know what happens after. If I win, will my allies be set free, or must they?\"</p><p>\"No bargains!\" the Lord of the Vampaneze snapped. \"We're not here to make deals. We're here to fight. The fate of the others - my people and yours - can be settled after we lock blades. Only we matter now. All else is meaningless.\"</p><p>\"Very well,\" Mr Crepsley grunted, then stepped away from the rail, crouched low and edged towards his foes.</p><p>On the ground, nobody moved. Vancha, Harkat, Debbie, Burgess and I had lowered our weapons and were oblivious to all around us. It would have been a simple task for the vampaneze to capture us, but they were as captivated by events on the platform as we were.</p><p>As Mr Crepsley advanced, the three vampaneze assumed a 'V' formation and shuffled forward a few metres. The Vampaneze Lord was in the middle, Gannen Harst a metre ahead of him on his left, Steve Leopard the same distance ahead on his right. It was a cautiously effective strategy. Mr Crepsley would have to attack through the centre - he had to kill the Vampaneze Lord; the others didn't matter. When he attacked, Harst and Steve would be able to strike from both sides at once.</p><p>Mr Crepsley stopped short of the three, arms outstretched to protect against darting attacks from either side. His eyes were focused on the Vampaneze Lord and he didn't blink once while I was watching.</p><p>Several strained seconds passed. Then Steve lashed out at Mr Crepsley with his chain. I saw spikes glitter as it snaked towards Mr Crepsley's head - they'd cause serious damage if they connected. But the vampire was faster than the half-vampaneze. Twisting his head ever so slightly to the left, he avoided the chain and spikes by a centimetre, then stabbed sharply at Steve's stomach with the knife in his left hand.</p><p>As Mr Crepsley attacked Steve, Gannen Harst swung at the vampire with his sword. My mouth opened to shout a warning, but then I saw I needn't bother - the vampire had been expecting the counter-measure and pivoted sweetly away from the sword, gliding inside the range of its sweep, coming within striking distance of the Vampaneze Lord.</p><p>Mr Crepsley used the knife in his right hand to slash forward, seeking to open the Vampaneze Lord's stomach. But the leader of the vampaneze was swift and blocked the blow with his barbed sword. The tip of Mr Crepsley's knife bit into the Lord's waist but only drew a thin trickle of blood.</p>","<p>Before the vampire could strike again, Steve struck at him with his dagger. He chopped wildly at Mr Crepsley - too wild for accuracy - and forced him back. Then Gannen Harst stepped in and let fly with his sword, and Mr Crepsley had to drop to the floor and roll backwards to escape.</p><p>They were on him before he got to his feet, blades flashing, Steve's chain whipping. It took all Mr Crepsley's speed, strength and skill to turn the swords aside, duck out of the way of the chain, and retreat on his knees before they overwhelmed him.</p><p>As the vampaneze hastened after the vampire, I feared they had the beating of him - the swords and chain were sneaking through Mr Crepsley's desperate defences; nicking him here, slicing him there. The wounds weren't life-threatening, but it was only a matter of time before a blade cut deeply into his stomach or chest, or the spikes of the chain snagged on his nose or eyes.</p><p>Mr Crepsley must have known the danger he was in, but he continued to fight a rearguard action, no longer taking the battle to the enemy, merely retreating and protecting himself as best he could, giving ground steadily, letting them push him towards the rail at the end of the platform, where he'd be cornered.</p><p>\"He can't keep this up,\" I muttered to Vancha, who was standing close by, his eyes glued to the platform. \"He's got to take a risk, and soon, before they trap him.\"</p><p>\"You think he's unaware of that?\" Vancha replied tersely.</p><p>\"Then why doesn't he?\"</p><p>\"Hush, boy,\" the scruffy Prince said softly. \"Larten knows what he's doing.\"</p><p>I wasn't so sure. Mr Crepsley was an expert fighter, but I felt he was in over his head this time. One to one, he could handle any vampaneze. Even in a two to one situation, I'd fancy him to walk away victorious. But three to one ?</p><p>I looked for some way up to the platform - if I could join him, I might be able to turn the tide of battle. But just then, the fight took a terminal turn.</p><p>Mr Crepsley was almost backed up against the rail, no more than half a metre away from a dead end. The vampaneze knew the difficult position he was in, and pushed forward with renewed eagerness, sensing the end. Steve sent his chain flicking at Mr Crepsley's face again, for the umpteenth time, but on this occasion the vampire didn't dodge the deadly spikes or duck out of their way. Instead, dropping the knife in his left hand, he reached up and grabbed the chain mid air. His fingers closed on spikes, and his mouth tightened with pain, but he didn't let go. Yanking sharply on the chain, he brought Steve crashing towards him. At the last possible instant he lowered his chin, so that Steve's face connected bone-crunchingly with the vampire's forehead.</p><p>Steve's nose popped and gushed blood. He shrieked loudly, falling to the floor. As he fell, Mr Crepsley sent the knife in his right hand flying at Gannen Harst, leaving himself weaponless. As Harst instinctively pulled out of the path of the knife, the Vampaneze Lord drove at Mr Crepsley with his sword.</p><p>Mr Crepsley threw himself away from the incoming sword tip. Crashing into the railing, he spun around so he was facing away from his opponents, grabbed the rail with his hands, swung his legs and body up with ferocious speed, and ended up doing a handstand on the rail.</p><p>While those of us on the ground gawped, stunned by the unexpected manoeuvre, Mr Crepsley lowered himself to chin level with the rail, then thrust away from it with all his strength. The vampire sailed, full stretch, through the air, soaring over the Vampaneze Lord and Gannen Harst - who'd stepped in front of his Lord to protect him, as he'd done many times during the fight - and Steve Leopard, who was still lying on the platform.</p><p>Mr Crepsley landed on his feet like a cat, behind the unprotected back of the Vampaneze Lord. Before the half-vampaneze or Gannen Harst could react, Mr Crepsley seized the Lord by the scruff of his shirt with his left hand, grabbed the waist of his trousers with his right, lifted him off the floor, spun to the edge of the platform - and tossed him head-first over the side, into the pit of stakes below!</p><p>There wastime for the Lord of the Vampaneze to scream - once - then he hit the stakes with a thud which made me wince. The stakes impaled him in a dozen different places, including through the heart and head. His body twitched a couple of times, then went still, and flames caught in his hair and clothes.</p><p>It happened so fast, at first I couldn't take it all in. But as the seconds passed, and the vampaneze stared, bewildered and distraught, into the pit at the flaming corpse of their leader, the full truth struck home. Mr Crepsley had killed the Lord of the Vampaneze - without their leader, they faced destined defeat - the War of the Scars was over - the future was ours - we'dWON !</p><p>Chapter SEVENTEEN</p><p>IT WASincredible. It was wonderful. It was almost beyond belief.</p><p>As the spirit of the vampaneze blew apart like the chains of smoke rising from their burning Lord's dead body, mine soared and I felt as though my chest would burst with relief and delight. In our darkest hour, despite the odds, against all expectations, we'd taken the fight to our foes and put their destructive designs to the sword. In my wildest dreams, I couldn't have imagined anything sweeter.</p><p>My eyes rose as Mr Crepsley stepped to the edge of the platform. The vampire was bloodied, sweating and exhausted, but a light shone in his eyes which could have illuminated the entire cavern. Spotting me among the shaken vampaneze, he smiled, raised a hand in salute, and opened his mouth to call something down.</p><p>That's when Steve Leopard screamed wildly and threw himself firmly into the back of the vampire.</p><p>Mr Crepsley pitched forward, arms flailing, clutching for the rail. It looked for a split second as if he was going to grab hold and haul himself up, but then gravity dragged him down with sickening speed, over the rail, out of safety's reach - into the pit after the Lord of the Vampaneze!</p><p>Chapter EIGHTEEN</p><p>THOUGH STEVEhad sent Mr Crepsley plummeting to his doom, he also accidentally threw the vampire a slender life-line. Because as Mr Crepsley toppled, Steve leant over the railing, eager to watch the vampire hit the stakes and die. As he did, the length of chain he'd used as a weapon - which he still clutched in his right hand - unfurled and dropped beside Mr Crepsley like a rope.</p><p>Throwing out a desperate hand, the vampire grabbed the chain, once again ignoring the pain as spikes buried themselves deep in the flesh of his palm. The chain reached its limit and snapped taut, halting Mr Crepsley's fall.</p><p>On the platform, Steve wailed as the weight of Mr Crepsley caused the chain to tighten around the flesh of his right hand. He tried shaking it loose, but couldn't. As he stood, leaning half over the rail, struggling with the chain, Mr Crepsley reached up, grabbed the sleeve of Steve's shirt, and pulled him over further, caring nothing for his own life, intent only on taking Steve's.</p>","<p>As the pair fell - Steve screaming, Mr Crepsley laughing - Gannen Harst thrust a hand out and caught Steves flailing left hand. The vampaneze groaned painfully as the weight of the two men dragged on the muscles and tendons in his arm, but braced himself against an upright support post and held tight.</p><p>\"Let go!\" Steve screamed, kicking out at Mr Crepsley, trying to knock him off. \"You'll kill us both!\"</p><p>\"That is what I mean to do!\" Mr Crepsley roared. He didn't seem in the least bit bothered by the threat of death. Maybe it was the rush of adrenaline pumping through his veins, having killed the Lord of the Vampaneze - or perhaps he didn't care about his own life if it meant killing Steve. Either way, he'd accepted his fate and made no attempt to climb Steve's body to safety. In fact, he started tugging on the chain, trying to break Gannen Harst's hold.</p><p>\"Stop!\" Gannen Harst roared. \"Stop and we'll let you go!\"</p><p>\"Too late!\" Mr Crepsley howled. \"I swore two things to myself when I came down here. One - I would kill the Lord of the Vampaneze. Two - I would kill Steve Leonard! I am not a man for leaving a job half done, so ?\"</p><p>He tugged even harder than before. Above him, Gannen Harst gasped and shut his eyes against the pain. \"I can't - hold on - much longer!\" he moaned.</p><p>\"Larten!\" Vancha shouted. \"Don't do it! Trade your life for his. We'll track him down later and finish him off!\"</p><p>\"By the black blood of Harnon Oan - no!\" Mr Crepsley roared. \"I have him now, so I will kill him. Let that be the end of it!\"</p><p>\"And what - about your - allies?\" Gannen Harst shouted, and as the words penetrated Mr Crepsley's skull, he stopped struggling and gazed up warily at the ex-protector of the Vampaneze Lord.</p><p>\"Asyou hold the life of Steve Leonard in your hands,\" Harst said quickly, \"Ihold the lives of your friends. If you kill Steve, I'll order their deaths too!\"</p><p>\"No,\" Mr Crepsley said quietly. \"Leonard is a madman. His life must not be spared. Let me?\"</p><p>\"No!\" Gannen Harst yelled. \"Spare Steve and I'll spare the others. That's the deal. Agree to it, quick, before I lose my grip and the bloodshed continues.\"</p><p>Mr Crepsley paused thoughtfully.</p><p>\"His life too!\" I shouted. \"Spare Mr Crepsley, or?\"</p><p>\"No!\" Steve snarled. \"Creepy Crepsley dies. I won't let him go.\"</p><p>\"Don't be stupid!\" Gannen Harst bellowed. \"You'll die too if we don't release him!\"</p><p>\"Then I'll die,\" Steve sneered.</p><p>\"You don't know what you're saying!\" Harst hissed.</p><p>\"I do,\" Steve replied softly. \"I'll let the others go, but Crepsley dies now, because he said I was evil.\" Steve glared down at the silent Mr Crepsley. \"And if I have to die with him, I will - consequences be damned!\"</p><p>While Gannen Harst stared at Steve, mouth agape, Mr Crepsley looked to where Vancha and I were standing. As our eyes locked in grim understanding, Debbie rushed up beside us. \"Darren!\" she shouted. \"We have to save him! We can't let him die! We?\"</p><p>\"Shhh,\" I whispered, kissing her forehead, holding her close.</p><p>\"But?\" she sobbed.</p><p>\"We can't do anything,\" I sighed.</p><p>While Debbie moaned and buried her face in my chest, Mr Crepsley addressed Vancha. \"It seems our paths must part, Sire.\"</p><p>\"Aye,\" Vancha croaked bitterly.</p><p>\"We shared some good times,\" Mr Crepsley said.</p><p>\"Great times,\" Vancha corrected him.</p><p>\"Will you sing my praises in the Halls of Vampire Mountain when you return, and drink a toast to me, even if it is only a glass of water?\"</p><p>\"I'll drink a crate of ale to your name,\" Vancha vowed, \"and sing death songs till my voice cracks.\"</p><p>\"You always did take things to extremes,\" Mr Crepsley laughed. Then his gaze settled on me. \"Darren,\" he said.</p><p>\"Larten,\" I replied, smiling awkwardly. I felt like crying, but couldn't. There was an awful emptiness inside of me and my emotions wouldn't respond.</p><p>\"Hurry!\" Gannen Harst shouted. \"My grip is slipping. A few more seconds and I'll?\"</p><p>\"A few seconds will suffice,\" Mr Crepsley said, not one to be rushed, even when death was beckoning. Smiling sadly at me, he said, \"Do not let hatred rule your life. My death does not need to be avenged. Live as a free vampire, not as a twisted, revenge-driven creature of despair. Do not become like Steve Leonard or R.V. My spirit will not rest easy in Paradise if you do.\"</p><p>\"You don't want me to kill Steve?\" I asked uncertainly.</p><p>\"By all means kill him!\" Mr Crepsley boomed. \"But do not devote yourself to the task. Do not?\"</p><p>\"I can't - hold - any longer!\" Gannen Harst wheezed. He was trembling and sweating from the strain.</p><p>\"Nor shall you have to,\" Mr Crepsley responded. His eyes passed from me to Vancha and back again, then up to the ceiling. He stared as though he could see through the layers of rock, concrete and earth above to the sky beyond. \"Gods of the vampires!\" he bellowed. \"Even in death, may I be triumphant!\"</p><p>Then, as the echoes of his final cry reverberated around the walls of the cavern, Mr Crepsley let go of the chain. He hung in the air an impossible moment, almost as though he could fly - then dropped like a stone towards the steel-tipped stakes beneath.</p><p>Chapter NINETEEN</p><p>AT THElast possible moment, when all seemed lost, someone on a rope swung from the ceiling, streaked through the air, grabbed Mr Crepsley around the waist, and rose with him to the safety of the platform, where they landed on their feet. As I stared, amazed, mouth hanging open, Mr Crepsley's rescuer turned - it was Mika Ver Leth, one of my fellow Vampire Princes!</p><p>\"Now!\" Mika roared, and at his cry an army of vampires climbed through the holes in the ceiling and dropped to the floor, landing among the flabbergasted vampaneze and vampets. Before our foes had a chance to defend themselves, our troops were upon them, swords swinging, knives darting, axes chopping.</p><p>On the platform, Gannen Harst howled miserably - \"No!\" - then threw himself at Mr Crepsley and Mika. As Harst lunged, Mika calmly stepped in front of Mr Crepsley, drew his sword, and swung it broadly at the advancing vampaneze, cutting his head clean off at the neck, sending it sailing through the air like a misdirected bowling ball.</p>","<p>As Gannen Harst's lifeless, headless body toppled over the side of the platform, Steve Leopard yelped, turned, and dashed for the safety of the tunnel. He'd made it almost to the end of the plank when Mr Crepsley borrowed one of Mika's knives, took careful aim, and sent it flashing through the air at the half-vampaneze.</p><p>The knife buried itself between Steve's shoulder blades. He gasped, stopped, spun around slowly, face white, eyes bulging, hands grasping for the hilt of the knife, unable to draw it out. Coughing up blood, he collapsed on to the plank, spasmed briefly and fell still.</p><p>Around us, the vampires were finishing off their opponents. Harkat and Vancha had joined the fighting and were cheerfully dispatching vampaneze and vampets. Behind them, Chief Inspector Alice Burgess was gazing upon the bloodshed, unsure of who these new warriors were. She sensed they were on our side, but she held on to her rifle, just in case.</p><p>Debbie was still sobbing into my chest - she hadn't looked up and realized what was happening! \"It's OK,\" I told her, tilting her head up. \"Mr Crepsley's safe. He's alive. The cavalry arrived.\"</p><p>\"Cavalry?\" she echoed, gazing around, wiping tears from her eyes. \"I don't understand. What ?? How ??\"</p><p>\"I don't know!\" I chortled, then grabbed Vancha's arm as he came within range. \"What's going on?\" I roared in his ear. \"Where did this lot come from?\"</p><p>\"I fetched them!\" he shouted gleefully. \"When I left yesterday, I flitted to Vampire Mountain and told them what was going on. They flitted back with me. They had to tread cautiously - I told them not to interfere until we'd killed the Vampaneze Lord - but they've been here all along, waiting.\"</p><p>\"But - I don't - its?\"</p><p>I stopped before my babbling got the better of me. I couldn't understand how they'd crept up so quietly, or how Vancha had reached Vampire Mountain and got back so quickly - even flitting, it should have taken him a few nights - but what did that matter? They were here, they were kicking ass, Mr Crepsley was alive and Steve Leopard and the Lord of the Vampaneze were dead. Why question it?</p><p>As I spun around like a child on Christmas Day surrounded by a room full of the most amazing presents, I saw a fabulously familiar figure pushing through the fighting, orange hair flecked with blood, a few new scars to add to the long one which carved up the left side of his face, limping on his sore ankle, but otherwise unbowed.</p><p>\"Mr Crepsley!\" I roared, throwing myself into his arms.</p><p>\"Master Shan!\" he laughed, hugging me tight to his chest. \"Did you think I was finished?\"</p><p>\"Yes!\" I sobbed.</p><p>\"Hah!\" he chuckled. \"You do not get rid of me that easily! You still have much to learn about our ways and customs. Who but I would have the patience to teach you?\"</p><p>\"Vain old git!\" I snuffled.</p><p>\"Rude young brat!\" he retorted, then pushed me back to study my face. Raising a hand, he thumbed tears and dirt away from my cheeks and then - then - then ?</p><p>Chapter TWENTY</p><p>NO. THAT'Snot how it happened.</p><p>I wish it was. With all my heart and soul, I wish he'd been rescued and our foes defeated. In that terrible, impossibly long moment of his fall, I imagined half a dozen fantastic scenarios, where Mika or Arrow or Mr Tall intervened to divert the course of fate, and we all walked away smiling. But it wasn't to be. There was no last-minute cavalry charge. No miraculous rescue. Vancha hadn't flitted to Vampire Mountain. We were alone, as we had to be, as destiny willed it.</p><p>Mr Crepsley dropped. He was impaled on the stakes. He died.</p><p>And it wasawful .</p><p>I can't even say that it was quick and merciful, as it was for the Lord of the Vampaneze, because he didn't die straightaway. The stakes didn't kill him instantly, and though his soul didn't linger long, his cries while he writhed there, bleeding and dying, burning and screaming, will stay with me till I die. Maybe I'll even carry them with me when I go.</p><p>Debbie wept bitterly. Vancha howled like a wolf. Green tears trickled from Harkat's round green eyes. Even the Chief Inspector turned away from the scene and sniffed miserably.</p><p>Not me. I couldn't. My eyes stayed dry.</p><p>Stumbling forward, I stopped at the edge of the pit and stared down at the stakes and the two bodies being quickly stripped bare of their flesh by the flames. I stood as though on guard, not budging or looking away, paying no attention as the vampaneze and vampets filed silently out of the cavern. They could have executed us, but their leader was dead, their dreams had been dashed, and they were no longer interested in battle - not even in revenge.</p><p>I was barely aware of Vancha, Debbie, Harkat and Alice Burgess as they came to stand by my side.</p><p>\"We should go now,\" Vancha muttered after a while.</p><p>\"No,\" I replied dully. \"I'm taking him with us, to bury him properly.\"</p><p>\"It'll be hours before the fire dies out,\" Vancha said.</p><p>\"I'm in no rush. The hunt's over. We've all the time in the world.\"</p><p>Vancha sighed deeply, then nodded. \"Very well. We'll wait.</p><p>\"Not me,\" Debbie sobbed. \"I can't. It's too horrible. I can't stay and ?\" She broke down in tears. I wanted to comfort her, but couldn't. There was nothing I could think to say to make her feel better.</p><p>\"I'll look after her,\" Burgess said, taking charge. \"We'll walk up the tunnel and wait for you in the smaller cavern.\"</p><p>\"Thanks, Alice,\" Vancha said.</p><p>Burgess paused before leaving. \"I'm still not sure about you guys,\" she said, \"if you're really vampires or not. And I haven't a clue what I'm going to tell my people about this. But I know evil when I see it, and I like to think I know good too. I won't stand in your way when it's time for you to leave. And if you need any help, you only have to call.\"</p><p>\"Thanks,\" Vancha said again, and this time he managed a thin, grateful smile.</p><p>The women left, Debbie crying, Burgess supporting her. They pushed through the departing ranks of vampaneze and vampets, who gave way meekly to the pair who'd helped bring about the downfall of their Lord.</p><p>Minutes passed. The flames flickered on. Mr Crepsley and the Lord of the Vampaneze burned.</p><p>Then a strange-looking pair hobbled up to confront us. One had no hands, although he carried a pair of hook-hands slung around his neck. The other had only half a face and was moaning piteously. R.V. and Morgan James.</p>","<p>\"We'll get you swine!\" R.V. snarled, pointing threateningly with his left stump. \"Gannen gave his word that he'd let you go, so we can't harm you now, but we'll hunt you down later and make you sorry you were born.\"</p><p>\"You'd better come well prepared, Hooky,\" Vancha commented dryly. \"You'll find us a realhandful !'</p><p>R.V. hissed at the joke and made to attack the Prince. Morgan held him back, mumbling through teeth - half of which had been shattered by Burgess' bullet - \"Curhm awahy! Thuy ahn't wurth iht!\"</p><p>\"Hah,\" Vancha chuckled spitefully. \"That's easy for you to say!\"</p><p>This time R.V. had to push Morgan James back as he struggled to get his hands on Vancha. Cursing and fighting with each other, they backed off, joined the ranks of their numbed colleagues, and drifted away to patch themselves up and plot mean-spirited revenge.</p><p>Again we were alone at the pit. The cavern was quieter now. Almost all the vampaneze and vampets had exited. Only a last few stragglers remained. Among them were Gannen Harst and a grinning Steve Leopard, who couldn't resist ambling over for one last mocking laugh.</p><p>\"What's that cooking on the fire, boys?\" he asked, putting up his hands as if to warm them.</p><p>\"Go away,\" I said blankly, \"or I'll kill you.\"</p><p>Steve's face dropped and he glared at me. \"It's your own fault,\" he pouted. \"If you hadn't betrayed me?\"</p><p>I swung my sword up, meaning to cut him in two.</p><p>Vancha swatted it aside with the flat of his hand before I drew blood. \"No,\" he said, stepping between us. \"If you kill him, the others will return and kill us. Let it drop. We'll get him later.\"</p><p>\"Wise words, brother,\" Gannen Harst said, stepping up beside Vancha. His face was drawn. \"There's been enough killing. We?\"</p><p>\"Get lost!\" Vancha snapped.</p><p>Harst's expression darkened. \"Don't speak to me like?\"</p><p>\"I won't warn you again,\" Vancha growled.</p><p>The ex-protector of the Vampaneze Lord bristled angrily, then raised his hands peacefully and backed away from his brother.</p><p>Steve didn't follow.</p><p>\"I want to tell him,\" the half-vampaneze said, eyes pinned on me.</p><p>\"No!\" Gannen Harst hissed. \"You mustn't! Not now! You?\"</p><p>\"Iwant totell him,\" Steve said again, more forcefully this time.</p><p>Harst cursed beneath his breath, glanced from one of us to the other, then nodded tensely. \"Very well. But over to one side, where nobody else can hear.\"</p><p>\"What are you up to now?\" Vancha asked suspiciously.</p><p>\"You'll find out,\" Steve giggled, taking hold of my left elbow.</p><p>I shrugged him off. \"Keep away from me, monster!\" I spat.</p><p>\"Now, now,\" he said. \"Don't be hasty. I've news I'm bursting to tell you.\"</p><p>\"I don't want to hear it.\"</p><p>\"Oh, but you do,\" he insisted. \"You'll kick yourself from here to the moon if you don't come and listen.\"</p><p>I wanted to tell him what he could do with his news, but there was something in his wicked eyes which made me pause. I hesitated a moment, then stomped away out of earshot of the others. Steve followed me, Gannen Harst hot on his heels.</p><p>\"If you hurt him ?\" Vancha warned them.</p><p>\"We won't,\" Harst promised, then stopped and shielded us with his body from the view of the rest.</p><p>\"Well?\" I asked, as Steve stood smirking at me.</p><p>\"We've come a long way, haven't we, Darren?\" he remarked. \"From the classroom at home to this Cavern of Retribution. From humanity to vampirism and vampanizm. From the day to the night.\"</p><p>\"Tell me something I don't know,\" I grunted.</p><p>\"I used to think it could have been different,\" he said softly, eyes distant. \"But now I think it was always meant to be this way. It was your destiny to betray me and form an alliance with the vampires, your fate to become a Vampire Prince and lead the hunt for the Vampaneze Lord. Just as it was my destiny to find my own path into the night and ?\"</p><p>He stopped and a sly expression crept over his face. \"Hold him,\" he grunted, and Gannen Harst grabbed my arms and held me rooted to the spot. \"Are you ready to send him sleepy-byes?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Harst said. \"But hurry, before the others intervene.\"</p><p>\"Your wish is my command,\" Steve smiled, then put his lips close to my right ear and whispered something terrible - something dreadful - something that turned my world on its head and would haunt my every waking and sleeping moment from that instant on.</p><p>As he drew away, having tormented me with his devastating secret, I opened my mouth wide to shout the news to Vancha. Before I could utter a syllable, Gannen Harst breathed over me, the knockout gas of the vampires and vampaneze. As the fumes filled my lungs, the world around me faded, and then I was falling, unconscious, into the tortured sleep of the damned.</p><p>The last thing I heard before I blacked out was Steve, laughing hysterically - the sound of a victorious demon cackling.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-ONE</p><p>IDIDN'Tknow where I was when I awoke. I opened my eyes and saw a ceiling high above me, with lots of panels ripped out of it, three chandeliers burning dimly now that their candles were mere waxen stumps. I couldn't think where I might be. I sat up, groaning, and looked for Mr Crepsley, to ask him what was going on.</p><p>That's when I remembered.</p><p>Moaning as the painful memories returned, I clambered to my feet and looked around in desperation. The fire in the pit of stakes had almost burnt itself out. Mr Crepsley and the half-vampaneze were charred, unrecognizable collections of brittle, blackened bones. Vancha and Harkat were sitting by the edge of the pit, faces glum, silently mourning.</p><p>\"How long was I out?\" I shouted, lurching towards the tunnel leading out of the cavern, falling clumsily to my knees in my frenzied haste.</p><p>\"Take it easy,\" Vancha said, helping me back to my feet.</p><p>I swiped his hands away and spun fiercely on him. \"How long?\" I roared.</p><p>Vancha eyeballed me, bemused, then shrugged. \"Three hours, maybe more.\"</p><p>My eyelids closed hopelessly and I let myself collapse again. Too long. They'd be halfway to the other side of the world by now.</p><p>\"What happened?\" I asked. \"The gas should have only knocked me out for fifteen or twenty minutes.\"</p>","<p>\"You were exhausted,\" Vancha said. \"It's been a long night. I'm surprised you woke this soon. It's dawn outside. We didn't expect you to stir until dusk.\"</p><p>I shook my head mutely, disgusted.</p><p>\"Are you OK, Darren?\" Harkat asked, hobbling over to join us.</p><p>\"No!\" I snapped. \"I'm not OK. None of us is.\"</p><p>Rising, I brushed past the puzzled-looking pair, and made my slow, painful way to the pit, where I gazed once more upon the smouldering remains of my dearest friend and mentor.</p><p>\"He's in a state of shock,\" I heard Vancha mutter softly to Harkat. \"Go easy on him. It'll take him a while to recover.\"</p><p>\"Recover!\" I shrieked, sitting down and laughing maniacally.</p><p>Vancha and Harkat sat beside me, Vancha to my left, Harkat to my right. Each laid a hand on mine in a silent show of support. My throat grew tight and I thought I was going to cry at last. But after a few seconds the tears still wouldn't come, so I let my gaze drift back to the pit, while my thoughts returned to Steve's chilling revelation.</p><p>The flames grew lower and the cavern cooled. It also darkened, as the candles overhead quenched themselves one by one.</p><p>\"We'd better get up there and - relight the candles,\" Harkat said, \"or else we won't be able to - see clearly when we go down to - collect Mr Crepsley's bones.\"</p><p>\"Leave him there,\" I said sullenly. \"This is as good a resting place as any.\"</p><p>Harkat and Vancha stared at me uncertainly.</p><p>\"But you were the one who wanted to bury him,\" Vancha reminded me.</p><p>\"That was before Steve took me aside,\" I sighed. \"It doesn't matter where we leave him now. Nothing matters any more.\"</p><p>\"How can you say that?\" Vancha snapped angrily. \"We won, Darren! We killed the Lord of the Vampaneze! The price we paid was high, but it was worth it.\"</p><p>\"You think so?\" I asked bitterly.</p><p>\"Of course!\" he shouted. \"What's one life judged against thousands? We knew the odds coming into this. We'd have sacrificed all our lives if we had to. I feel Larten's loss as much as you - he was my friend long before he was yours. But he died honourably, and gave his life for a cause that was just. If his spirits looking down on us, he'll be willing us to celebrate his great victory, not bemoan his?\"</p><p>\"You remember our first run-in with the Vampaneze Lord?\" I interrupted. \"You recall how he masqueraded as a servant, so we paid no notice to him and attacked the others, allowing him to escape?\"</p><p>Vancha nodded warily. \"Aye. What of it?\"</p><p>\"They tricked us then, Vancha,\" I said, \"and they've done it again. We've won nothing. Mr Crepsley died in vain.\"</p><p>Vancha and Harkat gawped at me.</p><p>\"What ?? I don't - Are you saying ??What ?\" Harkat gasped eventually.</p><p>\"The cloaked half-vampaneze on the platform was a decoy,\" I sighed. \"He wasn't the same person we saw in the glade. Steve told me the truth before he left. That was his parting present.\"</p><p>\"No!\" Vancha wheezed, his face ashen. \"He lied! That was their Lord. The look of despair on their faces when we killed him?\"</p><p>\"?was genuine,\" I said. \"Most of the vampaneze and vampets in the cavern believed he was their Lord. They were tricked just like we were. Only Gannen Harst and a handful of others knew the truth.\"</p><p>\"Then we're back where we were at the start?\" Vancha moaned. \"He's alive? We've no idea what he looks like? No way of knowing where he'll turn next?\"</p><p>\"Not exactly,\" I said with a crooked half-smile. \"There are only two hunters left now. That much has changed.\" I let out a long, disparaging breath, and gazed down into the pit again. I didn't want to tell them the rest, not coming so hot on the heels of Mr Crepsley's death and news of the Vampaneze Lord's escape. I'd have spared them this extra blow if I could.</p><p>But they had to be warned. In case something happened to me, they had to be told, so they could spread the word and carry on without me if necessary.</p><p>\"I know who he is,\" I whispered emotionlessly. \"Steve told me. He broke the big secret. Harst didn't want him to, but he did it anyway, to hurt me that little bit more, as if Mr Crepsley's death wasn't bad enough.\"</p><p>\"He told you who the - Vampaneze Lord is?\" Harkat gasped.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\"Who?\" Vancha shouted, leaping to his feet. \"Which one of those scum sends others to do his dirty work for him? Tell me and I'll?\"</p><p>\"It's Steve,\" I said, and Vancha's strength deserted him. Slumping to the floor, he gazed at me in horror. Harkat too. \"It's Steve,\" I said again, feeling empty and scared inside, knowing I'd never feel any different until - unless - he was killed, even if I lived to be a thousand. Wetting my lips, focusing on the flames, I said the whole terrible truth out loud. \"Steve Leopard is the Lord of the Vampaneze!'</p><p>After that there was only silence, burning and despair.</p><p>TO BE CONTINUED</p>"]},{"title":"The Lake of Souls","pages":["<p>PROLOGUE</p><p>DEATH WASon the cards that day, but would it be ours or the panther's?</p><p>Black panthers are really leopards. If you look closely, you can see faint spots blended into their fur. But trust me - unless it's in a zoo, you don't ever want to be that close to a panther! They're one of nature's greatest killers. They move silently and speedily. In a one-on-one fight they'll almost always come out on top. You can't outrun them, since they're faster than you, and you can't out-climb them, because they can climb too. The best thing is to stay out of their way completely, unless you're an experienced big game hunter and have come packing a rifle.</p><p>Harkat and I had never hunted a panther before, and our best weapons were a few stone knives and a long, round-ended stick that served as a club. Yet there we were, on the edge of a pit which we'd dug the day before, watching a deer we'd captured and were using as bait, waiting for a panther.</p><p>We'd been there for hours, hidden in a bush, clutching our humble weapons close to our sides, when I spotted something long and black through the cover of the surrounding trees. A whiskered nose stuck out from around a tree and sniffed the air testingly - the panther. I nudged Harkat gently and we watched it, holding our breath, stiff with fright. After a few seconds the panther turned and padded away, back into the gloom of the jungle.</p><p>Harkat and I discussed the panther's retreat in whispers. I thought the panther had sensed a trap and wouldn't return. Harkat disagreed. He said it would come back. If we withdrew further, it might advance fully the next time. So we wriggled backwards, not stopping until we were almost at the end of the long stretch of bush. From here we could only vaguely see the deer.</p><p>A couple of hours passed. We said nothing. I was about to break the silence and suggest we were wasting our time, when I heard a large animal moving. The deer was jumping around wildly. There was a throaty growl. It came from the far side of the pit. That was great - if the panther attacked the deer from there, it might fall straight into our trap and be killed in the pit. Then we wouldn't have to fight it at all!</p><p>I heard twigs snap as the panther crept up on the deer. Then there was a loud snapping sound as a heavy body crashed through the covering over the pit and landed heavily on the stakes we'd set in the bottom. There was a ferocious howl, followed by silence.</p><p>Harkat slowly got to his feet and stared over the bush at the pit. I stood and stared with him. We glanced at each other. I said uncertainly, \"It worked.\"</p><p>\"You sound like you didn't - expect it to,\" Harkat grinned.</p><p>\"I didn't,\" I laughed, and started towards the pit.</p><p>\"Careful,\" Harkat warned. \"It could still be alive.\"</p><p>Stepping in front of me, he moved off to the left and signalled for me to go right. Raising my knife, I circled away from Harkat, then we slowly closed on the pit from opposite directions.</p><p>Harkat was a few steps ahead of me, so he saw into the pit first. He stopped, confused. A couple of seconds later, I saw why. A body lay impaled on the stakes, blood dripping from its many puncture wounds. But it wasn't the body of a panther - it was a red baboon.</p><p>\"I don't understand,\" I said. \"That was a panther's growl, not a monkey's.\"</p><p>\"But how did ?\" Harkat stopped and gasped. \"The monkey's throat! It's been ripped open! The panther must?\"</p><p>He got no further. There was a blur of movement in the upper branches of the tree closest to me. Whirling, I caught a very brief glimpse of a long, thick, pure black object flying through the air with outstretched claws and gaping jaws - then the panther was upon me, roaring triumphantly.</p><p>Death was on the cards that day.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Six months earlier.</p><p>THE WALKup the tunnels, coming off the back of our battle with the vampaneze, was slow and exhausting. We left Mr Crepsley's charred bones in the pit where he'd fallen. I'd meant to bury him, but I hadn't the heart for it. Steve's revelation - that he was the Lord of the Vampaneze - had floored me, and now nothing seemed to matter. My closest friend had been killed. My world had been torn asunder. I didn't care whether I lived or died. Harkat and Debbie walked beside me, Vancha and Alice Burgess slightly in front. Debbie used to be my girlfriend, but now she was a grown woman, whereas I was stuck in the body of a teenager - the curse of being a half-vampire who only aged one year for every five that passed. Alice was a police chief inspector. Vancha had kidnapped her when we'd been surrounded by police. She and Debbie had taken part in the fight with the vampaneze. They'd both fought well. A shame it had been for nothing.</p><p>We'd told Alice and Debbie all about the War of the Scars. Vampires exist, but not the murderous monsters of myth. We don't kill when we feed. But other night creatures do - the vampaneze. They broke away from the vampires six hundred years ago. They always drain their victims dry. Their skin has turned purple over the centuries, and their eyes and fingernails are red.</p><p>For a long time there'd been peace between the two clans. That ended when the Lord of the Vampaneze emerged. This vampaneze leader was destined to lead them into war against the vampires and destroy us. But if we found and killed him before he became a full-vampaneze, the war would go our way instead.</p><p>Only three vampires could hunt for the Vampaneze Lord (according to a powerful meddler called Desmond Tiny, who could see into the future). Two were Vampire Princes, Vancha March and me. The other had been Mr Crepsley, the vampire who'd blooded me and been like a father to me. He'd faced the person we thought was the Vampaneze Lord earlier that night and killed him. But then Steve sent Mr Crepsley tumbling to his death in a pit of flame-tipped stakes - shortly before he let me know that the person Mr Crepsley killed was an impostor, and that Steve himself was the Vampaneze Lord.</p><p>It didn't seem possible that Mr Crepsley was dead. I kept expecting a tap on my shoulder, and the tall orange-haired vampire to be standing behind me when I turned, grinning wickedly, his long facial scar glinting as he held up a torch, asking where we thought we were going without him. But the tap never came. It couldn't. Mr Crepsley was dead. He'd never come back.</p><p>Part of me wanted to go mad with rage, seize a sword and storm off after Steve. I wanted to track him down and drive a stake through his rotten excuse for a heart. But Mr Crepsley had warned me not to devote myself to revenge. He said it would warp and destroy me if I gave in to it. I knew in my soul that there was unfinished business between Steve and me, that our paths would cross again. But for the time being I pushed him from my thoughts and mourned for Mr Crepsley.</p><p>Except I couldn't really mourn. Tears wouldn't come. As much as I wanted to howl and sob with grief, my eyes remained dry and steely. Inside, I was a broken, weeping wreck, but on the outside I was cold, calm and collected, as though I hadn't been affected by the vampire's death.</p><p>Ahead, Vancha and Alice came to a halt. The Prince looked back, his wide eyes red from crying. He looked pitiful in his animal skins, with his filthy bare feet and wild hair, like an overgrown, lost child. \"We're almost at the surface,\" he croaked. \"It's still day. Will we wait here for dark? If we're spotted ?\"</p><p>\"Don't care,\" I mumbled.</p><p>\"I don't want to stay here,\" Debbie sobbed. \"These tunnels are cruel.\"</p><p>\"And I have to inform my people that I'm alive,\" Alice said, then frowned and picked dried blood flecks from her pale white hair. \"Though I don't know how I'm going to explain it to them!\"</p><p>\"Tell the truth,\" Vancha grunted.</p><p>The Chief Inspector grimaced. \"Hardly! I'll have to think up some?\" She stopped. A figure had appeared out of the darkness ahead of us, blocking the path.</p><p>Cursing, Vancha ripped loose a shuriken - throwing stars he kept strapped in belts around his chest - and prepared to launch it.</p><p>\"Peace, Vancha,\" the stranger said, raising a hand. \"I am here to help, not harm.\"</p><p>Vancha lowered his shuriken and muttered in disbelief, \"Evanna?\"</p><p>The woman ahead of us clicked her fingers and a torch flared into life overhead, revealing the ugly witch we'd travelled with earlier in the year, while we were searching for the Lord of the Vampaneze. She hadn't changed. Short thick muscles, long untidy hair, pointed ears, a tiny nose, one brown eye and one green (the colours kept shifting from left to right), hairy body, long sharp nails and yellow ropes tied tight around her body instead of clothes.</p><p>\"What are you doing - here?\" Harkat asked, his large green eyes filled with suspicion - Evanna was a neutral in the War of the Scars, but could help or hinder those on either side, depending on her mood.</p><p>\"I came to bid Larten's spirit farewell,\" the witch said. She was smiling.</p><p>\"You don't look too cut up about it,\" I remarked without emotion.</p><p>She shrugged. \"I foresaw his death many decades ago. I did my crying for him then.\"</p><p>\"You knew he'd die?\" Vancha growled.</p><p>\"I wasn't certain, but I guessed he would perish,\" she said.</p><p>\"Then you could have stopped it!\"</p><p>\"No,\" Evanna said. \"Those with the ability to sense the currents of the future are forbidden to interfere. To save Larten, I'd have had to abandon the rules I live by, and if that happened, all chaos would break loose.\"</p><p>The witch stretched out a hand, and even though she was many metres away from Vancha, her fingers cupped his chin tenderly. \"I was fond of Larten,\" she said softly. \"I hoped I was wrong. But I couldn't take it upon myself to spare him. His fate wasn't mine to decide.\"</p><p>\"Then whose was it?\" Vancha snapped.</p><p>\"His own,\" Evanna replied steadily. \"Hechose to hunt for the Lord of the Vampaneze, to enter the tunnels, to fight on the platform. He could have walked away from his responsibilities - but he chose not to.\"</p><p>Vancha glared at the witch a moment longer, then lowered his gaze. I saw fresh tears splash in the dust at his feet. \"My apologies, Lady,\" he muttered. \"I don't blame you. I'm just so fired up with hatred.</p><p>\"I know,\" the witch said, then studied the rest of us. \"You must come with me. I have things to tell you, and I'd rather talk on the outside - the air here is rank with treachery and death. Will you spare me a few hours of your time?\" She glanced at Alice Burgess. \"I promise I won't keep you long.\"</p><p>Alice sniffed. \"I guess a few hours can't make much of a difference.\"</p><p>Evanna looked at Harkat, Debbie, Vancha and me. We shared a glance, then nodded and followed the witch up the last stretch of the tunnels, leaving the darkness and the dead behind.</p><p>Evanna gave Vancha a thick deer hide to drape over his head and shoulders, to block out the rays of the sun. Trailing after the witch, we moved quickly through the streets. Evanna must have cast a spell to hide us, because people didn't notice us, despite our blood-stained faces and clothes. We ended up outside the city, in a small forest, where Evanna had prepared a camp amidst the trees. At her offer, we sat and tucked into the berries, roots and water she'd set out for us.</p><p>We ate silently. I found myself studying the witch, wondering why she was here - if she'd really come to say goodbye to Mr Crepsley, she'd have gone down to where his body lay in the pit. Evanna was Mr Tiny's daughter. He had created her by mixing the blood of a vampire with that of a wolf. Vampires and vampaneze were barren - we couldn't have children - but Evanna was supposed to be able to bear a child by a male of either clan. When we met her shortly after setting out to hunt the Vampaneze Lord, she'd confirmed Mr Tiny's prophecy - that we'd have four chances to kill the Lord - and added the warning that if we failed, two of us would die.</p><p>Vancha finished eating first, sat back and burped. \"Speak,\" he snapped - he wasn't in the mood for formalities.</p><p>\"You're wondering how many chances you've used up,\" Evanna said directly. \"The answer is - three. The first was when you fought the vampaneze in the glade and let their Lord escape. The second, when you discovered Steve Leonard was a half-vampaneze and took him hostage - although you had several opportunities to kill him, they count as one. The third chance was when Larten faced him on the platform above the pit of stakes.\"</p><p>\"That means we still have a shot at him!\" Vancha hissed excitedly.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Evanna said. \"Once more the hunters will face the Vampaneze Lord, and on that occasion the future will be decided. But that confrontation will not come in the near future. Steve Leonard has withdrawn to plot anew. For now, you may relax.\"</p><p>The witch turned to me and her expression softened. \"It might not lighten your load,\" she said kindly, \"but Larten's soul has flown to Paradise. He died nobly and earned the reward of the righteous. He is at rest.\"</p><p>\"I'd rather he was here,\" I said miserably, gazing at the leaves of an overhanging tree, waiting for tears which still wouldn't come.</p><p>\"What about the rest of the vampaneze?\" Alice asked. \"Are any of them still in my city?\"</p><p>Evanna shook her head. \"All have fled.\"</p><p>\"Will they return?\" Alice asked, and by the glint in her eyes I saw she was half hoping they would, so she could settle a few scores.</p><p>\"No.\" Evanna smiled. \"But I think it's safe to say that you will run into them again.\"</p><p>\"I'd better,\" Alice growled, and I knew she was thinking of Morgan James, an officer of hers who'd joined the vampets. They were human allies of the vampaneze, who shaved their heads, daubed blood around their eyes, sported V tattoos above their ears, and dressed in brown uniforms.</p><p>\"Is the nightmare over then?\" Debbie asked, wiping her dark cheeks clean. The teacher had fought like a tigress in the tunnels, but the events of the night had caught up with her and she was shivering helplessly.</p>","<p>\"For you - for now,\" Evanna answered cryptically.</p><p>\"What does that mean?\" Debbie frowned.</p><p>\"You and the Chief Inspector can choose to distance yourselves from the War of the Scars,\" Evanna said. \"You can return to your ordinary lives and pretend this never happened. If you do, the vampaneze won't come after you again.\"</p><p>\"Of course we'll return to our lives,\" Alice said. \"What else can we do? We're not vampires. We don't have any further part to play in their war.\"</p><p>\"Perhaps,\" Evanna said. \"Or perhaps you'll think differently when you've had time to reconsider. You'll return to the city - you need time to reflect, and you have affairs to put in order - but whether or not you'll choose to stay ?\" Evanna's eyes flicked over Vancha, Harkat and me. \"And where do you three wish to go?\"</p><p>\"I'm continuing after that monster, Leonard,\" Vancha said immediately.</p><p>\"You may if you wish,\" Evanna shrugged, \"but you'll be wasting your time and energy. Moreover, you will jeopardize your position. Although you are fated to confront him again, it's not written in stone - by pursuing him now, you might miss the final destined showdown.\"</p><p>Vancha cursed bitterly, then asked Evanna where she suggested he should go.</p><p>\"Vampire Mountain,\" she said. \"Your clan should be told about the Vampaneze Lord. They must not kill him themselves - that rule still applies - but they can scout for him and point you in the right direction.\"</p><p>Vancha nodded slowly. \"I'll call a temporary end to the fighting and set everyone searching for him. I'll flit for Vampire Mountain as soon as night falls. Darren - are you and Harkat coming?\"</p><p>I looked at my fellow Prince, then down at the hard brown earth of the forest floor. \"No,\" I said softly. \"I've had all I can take of vampires and vampaneze. I know I'm a Prince and have duties to attend to. But I feel like my head's about to explode. Mr Crepsley meant more to me than anything else. I need to get away from it all, maybe for a while - maybe for ever.\"</p><p>\"It's a dangerous time to cut yourself off from those who care for you,\" Vancha said quietly.</p><p>\"I can't help that,\" I sighed.</p><p>Vancha was troubled by my choice, but he accepted it. \"I don't approve - a Prince should put the needs of his people before his own - but I understand. I'll explain it to the others. Nobody will trouble you.\" He cocked an eyebrow at Harkat. \"I suppose you'll be going with him?\"</p><p>Harkat lowered the mask from his mouth (air was poisonous to the grey-skinned Little People) and smiled thinly. \"Of course.\" Mr Tiny had resurrected Harkat from the dead. Harkat didn't know who he used to be, but he believed he could find out by sticking with me.</p><p>\"Where will you go?\" Vancha asked. \"I can find you using the Stone of Blood, but it'll be easier if I have a rough idea of where you're heading.\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" I said. \"I'll just pick a direction and ?\" I stopped as a picture flashed through my thoughts, of circus vans, snake-boys and hammocks. \"The Cirque Du Freak,\" I decided. \"It's the nearest place outside Vampire Mountain that I can call home.\"</p><p>\"A good choice,\" Evanna said, and by the way her lips lifted at the edges, I realized the witch had known all along that I'd choose to return to the Cirque.</p><p>We went our separate ways as the sun was setting, even though we hadn't slept and were ready to drop with exhaustion. Vancha departed first, on his long trek to Vampire Mountain. He said little when leaving, but hugged me hard and hissed in my ear, \"Be brave!\"</p><p>\"You too,\" I whispered back.</p><p>\"We'll kill Leonard next time,\" he vowed.</p><p>\"Aye,\" I grinned weakly.</p><p>He turned and ran, hitting flitting speed seconds later, vanishing into the gloom of the dusk.</p><p>Debbie and Alice left next, to return to the city. Debbie asked me to stay with her, but I couldn't, not as things stood. I needed to be by myself for a while. She wept and clutched me close. \"Will you come back later?\" she asked.</p><p>\"I'll try,\" I croaked.</p><p>\"If he doesn't,\" Evanna said, \"you can always go looking for him.\" She handed a folded-up piece of paper to Alice Burgess. \"Hold on to that. Keep it closed. When the two of you decide upon your course, open it.\"</p><p>The Chief Inspector asked no questions, just tucked the paper away and waited for Debbie to join her. Debbie looked at me pleadingly. She wanted me to go with her - or ask her to come with me - but there was a huge ball of grief sitting cold and hard in my gut. I couldn't think of anything else right now.</p><p>\"Take care,\" I said, turning aside and breaking eye contact.</p><p>\"You too,\" she croaked, then sobbed loudly and stumbled away. With a quick \"Goodbye\", Alice hurried after her, and the two women slipped through the trees, back to the city, supporting one another as they went.</p><p>That left just me, Harkat and Evanna.</p><p>\"Any idea where the Cirque's playing?\" the witch asked. We shook our heads. \"Then it's lucky that I do and am going there,\" she smiled. Standing between us, she looped her arms around my left arm and Harkat's right, and led us through the forest, away from the city and its underground caverns of death, back to where my voyage into the night first started - the Cirque Du Freak.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>ALEXANDER RIBSwas sleeping in a large tyre hanging from a tree. He always slept curled up - it kept his body supple and made it easier for him to twist and contort when he was performing. Normally he kept the tyre on a special stand in his caravan, but occasionally he'd drag it outside and sleep in the open. It was a cold night for sleeping outdoors - the middle of a wintry November - but he had a thick, fur-lined body-bag to keep the chill out.</p><p>As Alexander snored musically a young boy crept towards him, a cockroach in his right hand, with the intention of dropping it into Alexanders mouth. Behind him, his older brother and younger sister looked on with impish glee, urging him forward with harsh hand gestures whenever he paused nervously.</p><p>As the boy neared the tyre and held up the cockroach, his mother - always alert to mischief - stuck her head out of a nearby tent, ripped her left ear off and threw it at him. It spun through the air like a boomerang and knocked the cockroach from the boy's pudgy fingers. Yelping, he raced back to his brother and sister, while Alexander slept on, unaware of his narrow escape.</p><p>\"Urcha!\" Merla snapped, catching her ear as it circled back, then reattaching it to her head. \"If I catch you bothering Alexander again, I'll lock you in with the Wolf Man until morning!\"</p><p>\"Shancus made me do it!\" Urcha whined, receiving a dig in the ribs from his older brother.</p><p>\"I don't doubt he put you up to it,\" Merla growled, \"but you're old enough to know better. Don't do it again. Shancus!\" she added. The snake-boy looked at his mother innocently. \"If Urcha or Lilia get into trouble tonight, I'll hold you responsible.\"</p><p>\"I didn't do anything!\" Shancus shouted. \"They're always?\"</p><p>\"Enough!\" Merla cut him short. She started towards her children, then saw me sitting in the shadow of the tree next to the one Alexander Ribs was hanging from. Her expression softened. \"Hello, Darren,\" she said. \"What are you doing?\"</p><p>\"Looking for cockroaches,\" I said, managing a short smile. Merla and her husband, Evra Von - a snake-man and one of my oldest friends - had been very kind to me since I'd arrived a couple of weeks earlier. Though I found it hard to respond to their kindness in my miserable mood, I made as much of an effort as I could.</p><p>\"It's cold,\" Merla noted. \"Shall I fetch you a blanket?\"</p><p>I shook my head. \"It takes more than a slight frost to chill a half-vampire.\"</p><p>\"Well, would you mind keeping an eye on these three as long as you're outside?\" she asked. \"Evra's snake is moulting. If you can keep the kids out of the way, it'd be a real help.\"</p><p>\"No problem,\" I said, rising and dusting myself down as she went back inside the tent. I walked over to the three Von children. They gazed up at me uncertainly. I'd been unusually solemn since returning to the Cirque Du Freak, and they weren't quite sure what to make of me. \"What would you like to do?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Cockroach!\" Lilia squealed. She was only three years old, but looked five or six because of her rough, coloured scales. Like Shancus, Lilia was half-human, half-snake. Urcha was an ordinary, human, though he wished he could be like the other two, and sometimes glued painted scraps of tinfoil to his body, driving his mother wild with exasperation.</p><p>\"No more cockroaches,\" I said. \"Anything else?\"</p><p>\"Show us how you drink blood,\" Urcha said, and Shancus hissed at him angrily.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" I asked Shancus, who'd been named in my honour.</p><p>\"He's not supposed to say that,\" Shancus said, slicking back his yellow-green hair. \"Mum told us not to say anything about vampires - it might upset you.\"</p><p>I smiled. \"Mums worry about silly things. Don't worry - you can say whatever you like. I don't mind.\"</p><p>\"Can you show us how you drink then?\" Urcha asked again.</p><p>\"Sure,\" I said, then spread my arms, pulled a scary face, and made a deep groaning noise. The children shrieked with delight and ran away. I plodded after them, threatening to rip their stomachs open and drink all their blood.</p><p>Although I was able to put on a merry display for the kids, inside I felt as empty as ever. I still hadn't come to terms with Mr Crepsley's death. I was sleeping very little, no more than an hour or two most nights, and I'd lost my appetite. I hadn't drunk blood since leaving the city. Nor had I washed, changed out of my clothes, cut my nails - they grew quicker than a human's - or cried. I felt hollow and lost, and nothing in the world seemed worthwhile.</p><p>When I'd arrived at the Cirque, Mr Tall had spent the day locked in his trailer with Evanna. They emerged late that night and Evanna took off without a word. Mr Tall checked that Harkat and I were OK, then set us up with a tent, hammocks and anything else we required. Since then he'd spent a lot of time talking with me, recounting tales of Mr Crepsley and what the pair of them had got up to in the past. He kept asking me to chip in with my own recollections, but I could only smile faintly and shake my head. I found it impossible to mention the dead vampire's name without my stomach tightening and my head pulsing with pain.</p><p>I hadn't said much to Harkat lately. He wanted to discuss our friend's death but I couldn't talk about it, and kept turning him away, which upset him. I was being selfish, but I couldn't help it. My sorrow was all consuming and endless, cutting me off from those who cared and wished to help.</p><p>Ahead, the Von children stopped, grabbed twigs and pebbles, and threw them at me. I stooped to grab a stick, but as I did, my thoughts flashed back to that underground cavern and Mr Crepsley's face as he let go of Steve and crashed upon the fiery stakes. Sighing mournfully, I sat down in the middle of the clearing, taking no notice as the Vons covered me with moss and dirt and prodded me curiously. They thought this was part of the game. I hadn't the heart to tell them otherwise, so I just sat still until they grew bored and wandered away. Then I remained there, filthy and alone, as the night darkened and grew colder around me.</p><p>As another week dragged by, I withdrew further and further inside myself. I no longer answered people when they asked a question, only grunted like an animal. Harkat had tried talking me out of my mood three days earlier, but I swore at him and told him to leave me alone. He lost his temper and took a swipe at me. I could have ducked out of the way of his chunky grey fist, but I let him knock me to the ground. When he bent to help me up, I swatted his hand away. He hadn't spoken to me since.</p><p>Life went on as usual around me. The Cirque folk were excited. Truska - a lady who could grow a beard at will, then suck the hairs back into her face - had returned after an absence of several months. A big party was held after that nights performance to celebrate her return. There was much cheering and singing. I didn't attend. I sat by myself at the edge of camp, stony-faced and dry-eyed, thinking - as usual - about Mr Crepsley.</p><p>Late in the night, there was a tap on my shoulder. Glancing up, I saw Truska, smiling, holding out a slice of cake. \"I know you feeling low, but I'm thinking you might like this,\" she said. Truska was still learning to speak English and often mangled her words.</p><p>\"Thanks, but I'm not hungry,\" I said. \"Good to see you again. How have you been?\" Truska didn't answer. She stared at me a moment - then thrust the slice of cake into my face! \"What the hell!\" I roared, leaping to my feet.</p><p>\"That what you get for being big moody-guts,\" Truska laughed. \"I know you sad, Darren, but you can't sit round like grumpy bear all time.\"</p><p>\"You don't know anything about it,\" I snapped. \"You don't know what I'm feeling. Nobody does!\"</p><p>She looked at me archly. \"You think you the only one to lose somebody close? I had husband and daughter. They get killed by evil fishermen.\"</p><p>I blinked stupidly. \"I'm sorry. I didn't know.\"</p><p>\"Nobody here does.\" She sat beside me, brushed her long hair out of her eyes and gazed up at the sky. \"That why I left home and joined with Cirque Du Freak. I hurted terrible inside and had to get away. My daughter was less than two years old when she die.\"</p><p>I wanted to say something but my throat felt as though there was a rope tied tight around it.</p><p>\"The death of somebody you love is the second worst thing in world,\" Truska said softly. \"Worst thing is letting it hurt you so much that you die too - inside. Larten's dead and I am sad for him, but if you go on as you are being, I will be sadder for you, because you will be dead too, even though your body lives.\"</p>","<p>\"I can't help it,\" I sighed. \"He was like a father to me, but I didn't cry when he died. I still haven't. I can't.\"</p><p>Truska studied me silently, then nodded. \"It hard to live with sadness if you can't get it out with tears. Don't worry - you'll cry in end. Maybe you feel better when you do.\" Standing, she offered me a hand. \"You is dirty and smelly. Let me help clean you up. It might help.\"</p><p>\"I doubt it,\" I said, but followed her into the tent that Mr Tall had prepared for her. I wiped the traces of cake from around my face, undressed and wrapped a towel around myself while Truska filled a tub with hot water and layered it with scented oils. She left me to get in. I felt foolish stepping into the sweet-smelling water, but it was wonderful once I lay down. I stayed there for almost an hour.</p><p>Truska came in when I'd stepped out of the tub and dried myself. She'd taken my dirty clothes, so I had to keep a towel wrapped around my middle. She made me sit in a low chair and set about my nails with a pair of scissors and a file. I told her they wouldn't be any good - vampires have extra-tough nails - but she smiled and clipped the top of the nail off my right big toe. \"These super-sharp scissors. I know all about vampire nails - I sometimes cut Vancha's!\"</p><p>When Truska was done with my nails, she trimmed my hair, then shaved me and finished off with a quick massage. When she stopped, I stood and asked where my clothes were. \"Fire,\" she smirked. \"They was rotten. I chucked them away.\"</p><p>\"So what do you suggest I wear?\" I grumbled.</p><p>\"I have surprise,\" she said. Going to a wardrobe, she plucked forth brightly coloured clothes and draped them across the foot of her bed. I instantly recognized the bright green shirt, purple trousers and blue-gold jacket - the pirate costume I used to wear when I lived at the Cirque Du Freak.</p><p>\"You kept them,\" I muttered, smiling foolishly.</p><p>\"I told you last time you was here that I have them and would fix them so you can wear again, remember?\"</p><p>It seemed like years since we'd stopped at the Cirque shortly before our first encounter with the Lord of the Vampaneze. Now that I cast my mind back, I recalled Truska promising to adjust my old costume when she had a chance.</p><p>\"I wait outside,\" Truska said. \"Put them on and call when you ready.\"</p><p>I took a long time getting into the clothes. It felt weird to be pulling them on after all these years. The last time I'd worn them, I'd been a boy, still coming to terms with being a half-vampire, unaware of how hard and unforgiving the world could be. Back then I thought the clothes looked cool, and I loved wearing them. Now they looked childish and silly to me, but since Truska had gone to the trouble of preparing them, I figured I'd better put them on to please her.</p><p>I called her when I was ready. She smiled as she entered, then went to a different wardrobe and came back with a brown hat adorned with a long feather. \"I not have shoes your size,\" she said. \"We get some later.\"</p><p>Pulling on the hat, I tilted it at an angle and smiled self-consciously at Truska. \"How do I look?\"</p><p>\"See for yourself,\" she replied, and led me to a full-length mirror.</p><p>My breath caught in my throat as I came face to face with my reflection. It may have been a trick of the dim light, but in the fresh clothes and hat, with my clean-shaven face, I looked very young, like when Truska first kitted me out in this costume.</p><p>\"What you think?\" Truska asked.</p><p>\"I look like a child,\" I whispered.</p><p>\"That is partly the mirror,\" she chuckled. \"It is made to take off a few years - very kind to women!\"</p><p>Removing the hat, I ruffled my hair and squinted at myself. I looked older when I squinted - lines sprang up around my eyes, a reminder of the sleepless nights I'd endured since Mr Crepsley's death. \"Thanks,\" I said, turning away from the mirror.</p><p>Truska put a firm hand on my head and swivelled me back towards my reflection. \"You not finished,\" she said.</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I asked. \"I've seen all there is to see.\"</p><p>\"No,\" she said. \"You haven't.\" Leaning forward, she tapped the mirror. \"Look at your eyes. Look deep in them, and don't turn away until you see.\"</p><p>\"See what?\" I asked, but she didn't answer. Frowning, I gazed into my eyes, reflected in the mirror, searching for anything strange. They looked the same as ever, a little sadder than usual, but ?</p><p>I stopped, realizing what Truska wanted me to see. My eyes didn't just look sad - they were completely empty of life and hope. Even Mr Crepsleys eyes, as he died, hadn't looked that lost. I knew now what Truska meant when she said the living could be dead too.</p><p>\"Larten not want this,\" she murmured in my ear as I stared at the hollow eyes in the mirror. \"He love life. He want you to love it too. What would he say if he saw this alive-but-dead gaze that will get worse if you not stop?\"</p><p>\"He - he ?\" I gulped deeply.</p><p>\"Empty is no good,\" Truska said. \"You must fill eyes, if not with joy, then with sadness and pain. Even hate is better than empty.\"</p><p>\"Mr Crepsley told me I wasn't to waste my life on hate,\" I said promptly, and realized this was the first time I'd mentioned his name since arriving at the Cirque Du Freak. \"Mr Crepsley,\" I said again, slowly, and the eyes in the mirror wrinkled. \"Mr Crepsley,\" I sighed. \"Larten. My friend.\" My eyelids were trembling now, and tears gathered at the edges. \"He's dead,\" I moaned, turning to face Truska. \"Mr Crepsley's dead!\"</p><p>With that, I threw myself into her embrace, locked my arms around her waist, and wailed, finally finding the tears to express my grief. I wept long and hard, and the sun had risen on a new morning before I cried myself out and slid to the floor, where Truska slipped a pillow under my head and hummed a strange, sad tune as I closed my eyes and slept.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>IT WASa cold but dry March - star-filled nights, frost-white dawns and sharp blue days. The Cirque Du Freak was performing in a large town situated close to a waterfall. We'd been there four nights already, and it would be another week before we moved on - lots of tourists were coming to our shows, as well as the residents of the town. It was a busy, profitable time.</p><p>In the months after I first cried in Truska's tent, I'd wept a lot for Mr Crepsley. It had been horrible - the slightest reminder of him could set me off - but necessary. Gradually the tearful bursts had lessened, as I came to terms with my loss and learnt to live with it.</p><p>I was lucky. I had lots of friends who helped. Truska, Mr Tall, Hans Hands, Cormac Limbs, Evra and Merla all talked me through the hard times, discussing Mr Crepsley with me, gently guiding me back to normality. Once I'd patched things up with Harkat and apologized for the way I'd treated him, I relied on the Little Person more than anyone else. We sat up many nights together, remembering Mr Crepsley, reminding each other of his personal quirks, things he'd said, expressions he'd favoured.</p><p>Now, months later, the tables had turned andI was doing the comforting. Harkat's nightmares had returned. He'd been suffering from agonizing dreams when we left Vampire Mountain at the start of our quest, dreams of wastelands, stake-filled pits and dragons. Mr Tiny said the dreams would worsen unless Harkat went with him to find out who he'd been before he died, but Harkat chose to accompany me instead on my hunt for the Vampaneze Lord.</p><p>Later, Evanna helped me stop his nightmares. But the witch said it was only a temporary solution. When the dreams resumed, Harkat would have to find out the truth about himself or be driven insane.</p><p>For the last month Harkat had been tormented every time he slept. He stayed awake as long as he could - Little People didn't need much sleep - but whenever he dozed off, the nightmares washed over him and he'd thrash and scream in his sleep. It had reached the stage where he had to be tied down when he slept - otherwise he stumbled through the camp, hitting out at imaginary monsters, causing damage to anything he encountered.</p><p>After five days and nights, he'd fallen asleep at the end of our latest show. I'd tied him down in his hammock, using strong ropes to strap his arms by his sides, and sat beside him while he tossed and moaned, wiping green beads of sweat from his forehead, away from his lidless eyes.</p><p>Finally, early in the morning, after hours of shrieking and straining, the cries stopped, his eyes cleared and he smiled weakly. \"You can untie me - now. All done for tonight.\"</p><p>\"That was a long one,\" I muttered, undoing the knots.</p><p>\"That's the trouble with putting - sleep off so long,\" Harkat sighed, swinging out of his hammock. \"I postpone the nightmares for a while, but I - sleep longer.\"</p><p>\"Maybe you should try hypnosis again,\" I suggested. We'd done everything we could think of to ease Harkat's pain, asking all the performers and crew in the Cirque if they knew of a cure for nightmares. Mr Tall had tried hypnotizing him, Truska had sung to him while he slept, Rhamus Twobellies had rubbed a foul-smelling ointment over his head - all to no avail.</p><p>\"No good,\" Harkat smiled tiredly. \"Only one person can help - Mr Tiny. If he returns and shows me how to - find out who I was, the dreams - will hopefully stop. Otherwise ?\" He shook his squat, grey, neckless head.</p><p>After washing off the sweat in a barrel of cold water, Harkat accompanied me to Mr Tall's van, to learn our schedule for the day. We'd been doing a variety of odd jobs since hooking up with the Cirque, putting up tents, fixing broken seats and equipment, cooking and washing.</p><p>Mr Tall had asked me if I'd like to perform in the shows, as his assistant. I told him I didn't want to - it would have felt too weird being on stage without Mr Crepsley.</p><p>When we reported for duty, Mr Tall was standing in the doorway of his van, beaming broadly, his little black teeth shining dully in the early morning light. \"I heard you roaring last night,\" he said to Harkat.</p><p>\"Sorry,\" Harkat said.</p><p>\"Don't be. I mention it only to explain why I didn't come to you straightaway with the news - I thought it best to let you sleep.\"</p><p>\"What news?\" I asked warily. In my experience, unexpected news was more often bad than good.</p><p>\"You have visitors,\" Mr Tall chuckled. \"They arrived late last night, and have been waiting impatiently.\" He stepped aside and waved us in.</p><p>Harkat and I shared an uncertain glance, then entered cautiously. Neither of us carried a weapon - there seemed to be no need while we travelled with the Cirque Du Freak - but we bunched our hands into fists, ready to lash out if we didn't like the look of our \"visitors\". Once we saw the pair sitting on the couch, our fingers relaxed and we bounded forward, excited.</p><p>\"Debbie!\" I yelled. \"Alice! What are you doing here?\"</p><p>Debbie Hemlock and Chief Inspector Alice Burgess rose to hug us. They were simply dressed in trousers and jumpers. Debbie had cut her hair since I last saw her. It was short and tightly curled. I didn't think it suited her, but I said nothing about it.</p><p>\"How are you?\" Debbie asked once I'd released her. She was studying my eyes quietly, checking me out.</p><p>\"Better,\" I smiled. \"It's been rough but I'm over the worst - touch wood.\"</p><p>\"Thanks to his friends,\" Harkat noted wryly.</p><p>\"What about you?\" I asked the women. \"Did the vampaneze return? How did you explain things to your bosses and friends?\" Then, \"What are you doing here?\" I asked again, perplexed.</p><p>Debbie and Alice laughed at my confusion, then sat down and explained all that had happened since we parted in the forest outside the city. Rather than make a genuine report to her superiors, Alice claimed to have been unconscious the entire time since being kidnapped by Vancha March. It was a simple story, easy to stick to, and nobody had cause to disbelieve her.</p><p>Debbie faced rougher questioning - when the vampaneze told the police we were holding Steve Leonard, they also mentioned Debbie's name. She'd protested her innocence, said she only knew me as a student, and knew nothing at all about Steve. With Alice's support, Debbie's story was finally accepted and she was released. She'd been shadowed for a few weeks, but eventually the police left her to get on with her life.</p><p>The officials knew nothing of the battle that had taken place in the tunnels, or of the vampaneze, vampets and vampires who'd been busy in their city. As far as they were concerned, a group of killers - Steve Leonard, Larten Crepsley, Darren Shan, Vancha March and Harkat Mulds - were responsible for the murders. One escaped during their arrest. The others broke out of prison later and fled. Our descriptions had been circulated near and far, but we were no longer the problem of the city, and the people there didn't much care whether we'd been humans or vampires - they, were just glad to be rid of us.</p><p>When a suitable period had passed, and interest in them dropped, Alice met Debbie and the pair discussed their bizarre brush with the world of vampires. Debbie had quit her job at Mahler's - she couldn't face work - and Alice was thinking about handing in her resignation too.</p><p>\"It seemed pointless,\" she said quietly, running her fingers through her short white hair. \"I joined the force to protect people. When I saw how mysterious and deadly the world really is, I no longer felt useful. I couldn't return to ordinary life.\"</p><p>Over a number of weeks, the women talked about what they'd experienced in the tunnels, and what to do with their lives. They both agreed that they couldn't go back to the way they'd been, but they didn't know how to reshape their futures. Then, one night, after a lot of drinking and talking, Debbie said something that would change their lives completely and give them a new, purposeful direction.</p><p>\"I was worrying about the vampets,\" Debbie told us. \"They seem more vicious than the vampaneze. Their masters have morals of a kind, but the vampets are just thugs. If the vampaneze win the war, it doesn't seem likely that the vampets will want to stop fighting.\"</p>","<p>\"I agreed,\" Alice said. \"I've seen their kind before. Once they develop a taste for battle, they never lose it. But without vampires to attack, they'll have to look elsewhere for prey.\"</p><p>\"Humanity,\" Debbie said quietly. \"They'll turn on humans if they get rid of all the vampires. They'll keep recruiting, growing all the time, finding weak, greedy people and offering them power. With the vampaneze behind them, I think they might pose a real threat to the world in the years to come.\"</p><p>\"But we didn't think the vampires would worry about that,\" Alice said. \"The vampaneze are the real threat to the vampire clan. The vampets are just a nuisance as far as vampires are concerned.\"</p><p>\"That's when I said we needed to fight fire with fire.\" Debbie's face was stern, unusually so. \"This isour problem. I said we needed to recruit humans to fight the vampets, now, before they grow too strong. I was speaking generally when I used 'our' and 'we', but as soon as I said it, I realized it wasn't general - it was personal.\"</p><p>\"Victims wait for others to fight on their behalf,\" Alice said roughly. \"Those who don't want to be victims fight for themselves.\"</p><p>By the time the sun rose, the pair had drawn up a plan to travel to Vampire Mountain, elicit the approval of the Princes, and build an army of humans to counter the threat of the vampets. Vampires and vampaneze don't use guns or bows and arrows - they make a vow when blooded never to avail of such weapons - but vampets aren't bound by such laws. Alice and Debbie's army wouldn't be bound by those laws either. With the help of the vampires they could track the vampets, then engage them on equal, vicious terms.</p><p>\"We'd almost finished packing before the glaring flaw hit us,\" Debbie laughed. \"We didn't know where Vampire Mountain was!\"</p><p>That's when Alice recalled the piece of paper Evanna had given her. Returning to her apartment, where she'd stored it, she unfolded it and discovered directions to where the Cirque Du Freak was currently playing - here by the waterfall.</p><p>\"But Evanna gave you that paper months ago!\" I exclaimed. \"How did she know where the Cirque would be?\"</p><p>Alice shrugged. \"I've tried not to think about that one. I'm just about OK with the notion of vampires, but witches who can foresee the future - that's a step too far. I prefer to believe she checked with the guy who runs this place before she met us.\"</p><p>\"Though that doesn't explain how she knew when we'd read the message,\" Debbie added with a wink.</p><p>\"I suppose this means we're meant to - guide you to Vampire Mountain,\" Harkat mused.</p><p>\"Looks like it,\" Alice said. \"Unless you've other plans?\"</p><p>Harkat looked at me. I'd made it very clear when Mr Crepsley died that I didn't want anything to do with vampires for a while. This call was mine.</p><p>\"I'm not keen on going back,\" I sighed. \"It's still too soon. But for something this important, I guess I don't have much of a choice. As well as showing you the way, maybe I can act as the middle man between you and the Generals.\"</p><p>\"We were thinking along those lines,\" Debbie smiled, leaning over to squeeze my hands. \"We're not sure what the vampires will think of two human women turning up with an offer to build an army to help them. We know little of their ways or customs. We need someone to fill us in.\"</p><p>\"I'm not sure the Princes will - accept your proposal,\" Harkat said. \"Vampires have always fought their - own battles. I think they'll want to do the same now, even - if the odds are stacked against them.\"</p><p>\"If they do, we'll fight the vampets without them,\" Alice snorted. \"But they'd be fools to disregard us, and from what I've seen, vampires aren't foolish.\"</p><p>\"It makes sense,\" I said. \"Send humans to fight the vampets and leave the clan free to focus on the vampaneze.\"</p><p>\"Since when did vampires do things - because they made sense?\" Harkat chuckled. \"But it's worth a try. I'll come with you.\"</p><p>\"Oh no you won't,\" someone chortled behind us. Turning, startled, we saw that we'd been joined in the van by a third, uninvited guest, a short man with a savage leer. He was instantly recognizable and immediately unwelcome ?Mr Tiny !</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>THE CREATORof the Little People was dressed in his customary yellow suit and green Wellington boots. He eyed us though thick glasses and twirled a heart-shaped watch between the fingers of his left hand. He was small and pudgy, with pure white hair and a cruel, mocking smile.</p><p>\"Hello boys,\" he greeted Harkat and me. \"Andhello ! beautiful ladies.\" He winked rakishly at Debbie and Alice. Debbie smiled, but the ex-Chief Inspector was wary. Mr Tiny took a seat and removed a boot to empty dirt out of it. I saw the strange, six webbed toes I'd glimpsed once before. \"I see you survived your run-in with Master Leonard,\" he drawled, putting the boot back on.</p><p>\"No thanks to you,\" I sniffed angrily. \"You knew Steve was the Lord of the Vampaneze. You could have told us.\"</p><p>\"And spoilt the surprise?\" Mr Tiny laughed. \"I wouldn't have missed that fatal confrontation in the Cavern of Retribution for anything. I haven't enjoyed myself so much in years. The tension was unbearable, even though I guessed the outcome.\"</p><p>\"You weren't in the cavern,\" I challenged him. \"And you didn'tguess the outcome - youknew how it would end!\"</p><p>Mr Tiny yawned insolently. \"I might not have been there physically,\" he said, \"but I was there in spirit. As for knowing the final outcome - I didn't. I suspected Larten would fail, but I wasn't sure. Hecould have won.</p><p>\"Anyhow,\" he said, clapping sharply. \"That's in the past. We've other fish to fry.\" Looking at Harkat, he spun his watch so that it caught the light shining in the window of the van and reflected it into Harkat's round green eyes. \"Been sleeping well, Master Mulds?\"</p><p>Harkat stared straight back at his master and said blankly, \"You know only too damn - well that I haven't.\"</p><p>Mr Tiny tucked his watch away without taking his eyes off Harkat. \"Time to find out who you used to be,\" he murmured. Harkat stiffened.</p><p>\"Why now?\" I asked.</p><p>\"His nightmares have intensified. He must come with me and search for his true identity, or stay, go mad - and perish.\"</p><p>\"Why can't you just tell him?\" I prodded.</p><p>\"Doesn't work that way,\" Mr Tiny said.</p><p>\"Will I be gone long?\" Harkat asked quietly.</p><p>\"Oh yes,\" came the answer. \"For ever, if things don't go well. It's not a case of simply finding out who you were and returning. The road is long and dangerous, and even if you struggle along to the end, there's no guarantee you'll make it back. But it's a road you must tread - unless you'd rather go loopy and die.\" Mr Tiny let out a fake sigh. \"Poor Harkat - trapped between the devil and the deep blue sea.\"</p><p>\"You're all heart,\" Harkat grumbled, then faced me with a look of disgust. \"Looks like this is where - we part company.\"</p><p>\"I could come with you?\" I began, but he cut me short with a wave of a rough grey hand.</p><p>\"Forget it,\" he said. \"You have to lead Debbie and - Alice to Vampire Mountain. Not just to guide them, but to - protect them - it's a hard trek.\"</p><p>\"We could wait until you returned,\" Debbie said.</p><p>\"No,\" Harkat sighed. \"There's no telling how long - I'll be gone.\"</p><p>I gazed helplessly at Harkat. He was my best friend, and I hated the thought of leaving him. But I loved Debbie and didn't want to abandon her.</p><p>\"Actually,\" Mr Tiny purred, stroking the top of his heart-shaped watch, \"I think young Shanshould accompany you - assuming you value your life.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" Harkat barked sharply.</p><p>Mr Tiny studied his fingernails and spoke with a deceptively light tone. \"If Darren accompanies you, your chances of survival are fair. Alone, it's practically certain you'll fail.\"</p><p>My eyes narrowed hatefully. Mr Tiny had set Mr Crepsley and me on the trail of the Vampaneze Lord, knowing it was a journey bound to end in death. Now he wished to launch me on another.</p><p>\"Darren's not coming,\" Harkat said as I opened my mouth to lay into Mr Tiny. \"He has problems of his own - with the vampaneze. This is my quest, not his.\"</p><p>\"Of course, dear boy,\" Mr Tiny simpered. \"I fully understand, and if he chooses to go with the beautiful ladies, I won't say anything to stop him. But it would be terribly wrong of me not to let him know in advance the awful?\"</p><p>\"Stop!\" Harkat snapped. \"Darren goes with Debbie and - Alice. End of story.\"</p><p>\"Harkat,\" I muttered uncertainly, \"maybe we should?\"</p><p>\"No,\" he stopped me. \"Your loyalty lies with the vampires. It's time you returned to the fold. I'll be OK on my own.\" And he turned away and wouldn't say anything more about it.</p><p>We broke camp before midday. Debbie and Alice had come well equipped, with ropes, thick jumpers, climbing boots, strong torches, lighters and matches, guns, knives, you name it! As a half-vampire, I didn't require any special tools. All I packed in my rucksack was a good strong knife and a change of clothes. I was wearing jeans, a shirt and a light jumper. Although Truska had gone to a lot of trouble restoring my pirate costume, I didn't feel comfortable in it - it was a child's outfit. I'd picked up more normal gear over the lastfew months. Truska didn't mind - she said she'd give the costume to Shancus or Urcha when they were older.</p><p>I didn't wear my shoes. The trek to Vampire Mountain was a solemn tradition among vampires. No shoes or climbing gear were allowed. Normally you weren't allowed to flit either.</p><p>In recent years, because of the War of the Scars, that rule had been relaxed. But the others still stood. Debbie and Alice thought I was crazy! It's hard for humans to understand the world of the creatures of the night.</p><p>One other thing I did take was my diary. I'd thought the diary lost for ever - it had been left behind in the city, along with the rest of my personal belongings - and was astonished when Alice produced it with a flourish.</p><p>\"Where'd you get it?\" I gasped, fingering the soft, crinkled cover of one of the several notepads that made up the diary.</p><p>\"It was part of the evidence my officers collected after you were arrested. I sneaked it out before I quit the force.\"</p><p>\"Did you read it?\" I asked.</p><p>\"No, but others did.\" She smiled. \"They dismissed it as the fictional work of a lunatic.\"</p><p>I looked for Harkat before we left, but he was locked away in Mr Tall's van with Mr Tiny. Mr Tall came to the door when I knocked and said the Little Person was not receiving visitors. I called out \"Goodbye\" but there was no reply.</p><p>I felt lousy as we cleared the camp, having said farewell to Evra, Merla and my other friends. But Harkat had been firm about his wishes, and I knew it made more sense to go to Vampire Mountain and take my rightful place in the Hall of Princes again.</p><p>Debbie was delighted to have me back, and held on tight to my hand, telling me how excited she was - and a bit scared - to be heading for Vampire Mountain. She pumped me for information - what did vampires wear, did they sleep in coffins, could they turn into bats - but I was too distracted to answer in any great detail.</p><p>We'd walked two or three kilometres when I drew to a sudden halt. I was thinking about the times Harkat had saved my life - when he'd rescued me from the jaws of a savage bear, when he'd jumped into a pit during my Trials of Initiation and killed a wild boar as it was about to gouge me to death, the way he'd fought beside me, swinging his axe with speed and skill, when we'd taken on the vampaneze.</p><p>\"Darren?\" Debbie asked, gazing into my eyes, worried. \"What's wrong?\"</p><p>\"He's got to go back,\" Alice answered for me. I stared at her and she smiled. \"You can't ignore the obligations of friendship. Harkat needs you more than we do. Go help him, and catch us up later if you can.\"</p><p>\"But he told me to leave,\" I muttered.</p><p>\"Doesn't matter,\" Alice insisted. \"Your place is with him, not us.\"</p><p>\"No!\" Debbie objected. \"We can't find our way to the Mountain alone!\"</p><p>Alice pulled a map out of her rucksack. \"I'm sure Darren can point us in the right direction.\"</p><p>\"No!\" Debbie cried again, clutching me tight. \"I'm afraid I'll never see you again if you leave!\"</p><p>\"I must,\" I sighed. \"Alice is right - I have to help Harkat. I'd rather stay with you, but I'd feel like a traitor if I did.\"</p><p>There were hard tears in Debbie's eyes, but she blinked them back and nodded tensely. \"OK. If that's the way you want it.\"</p><p>\"It's the way it has to be,\" I said. \"You'd do the same thing in my place.\"</p><p>\"Possibly.\" She smiled weakly, then, hiding her feelings behind a businesslike facade, she grabbed the map off Alice, laid it on the ground and told me to ink in the route to Vampire Mountain.</p><p>I quickly outlined the easiest route, pointed out a couple of alternate paths in case the first was blocked, and told them how to find their way through the maze of tunnels which led up the inside of the Mountain to the Halls where the vampires lived. Then, without any long goodbyes, I kissed Debbie quickly and thrust the rucksack with my newly recovered diary into Alice's hands. I asked her to look after it for me.</p><p>I wished both women well, then turned and raced back for camp. I tried not to dwell on all that could happen to them on their way to the Mountain, and offered up a quick prayer to the gods of the vampires as I ran, asking them to watch over the ex-Chief Inspector and the teacher I loved.</p>","<p>I was on the edge of the camp when I spotted Mr Tiny and Harkat in an open field. In front of the pair stood a shimmering arched doorway, unconnected to anything else. The edges of the doorway glowed red. Mr Tiny also glowed, his suit, hair and skin pulsing a dark, vibrant, crimson shade. The space within the edges of the doorway was a dull grey colour.</p><p>Mr Tiny heard me coming, looked over his shoulder and smiled like a shark. \"Ah - Master Shan! I thought you might turn up.\"</p><p>\"Darren!\" Harkat snapped furiously. \"I told you not to come! I won't take you with - me. You'll have to?\"</p><p>Mr Tiny laid a hand on the Little Person's back and shoved him through the doorway. There was a grey flash, then Harkat disappeared. I could see the field through the grey veil of the doorway - but no sign of Harkat.</p><p>\"Where's he gone?\" I shouted.</p><p>\"To search for the truth.\" Mr Tiny smiled, edged aside and gestured towards the glowing doorway. \"Care to search with him?\"</p><p>I stepped up to the doorway, gazing uneasily at the glowing red edges and the grey sheen between. \"Where does this lead?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Another place,\" Mr Tiny answered obscurely, then laid a hand on my right shoulder and looked at me intently. \"If you follow Harkat, you might never return. Think seriously about this. If you go with Harkat and die, you won't be here to face Steve Leonard when the time comes, and your absence might have terrible repercussions for vampires everywhere. Is your short, grey-skinned friend worth such an enormous risk?\"</p><p>I didn't have to think twice about that. \"Yes,\" I answered simply, and stepped through into unnatural, otherworldly greyness.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>ASUNburnt brightly in the clear sky above the wasteland, highlighting the arid earth and bare rocky hills. A coarse red dust covered much of the land, choking the dry soil. When strong winds blew, the dust rose in sheets, making breathing almost impossible. At such times I pulled on one of Harkat's spare masks - it blocked out the worst of the grainy particles - and the two of us sought shelter and waited for calm to descend.</p><p>It had been two weeks - roughly - since Mr Tiny brought us to this desolate land and abandoned us. Two weeks crossing barren valleys and dead hills, where nothing lived except a few hardy lizards and insects, which we caught and ate whenever we could. They tasted disgusting but you can't be choosy if you're stranded in a desert without food or water.</p><p>Water was our main concern. Walking in the heat and dust was thirsty work, but water was in scarce supply and we didn't have any canteens to store it in when we found the occasional pool. We'd fashioned primitive containers from the skins of lizards, but they didn't hold much. We had to drink sparingly.</p><p>Harkat was angry with me for disobeying his wishes - he ranted at me nonstop for a few days - but his temper gradually abated. Although he hadn't thanked me for choosing to accompany him on his quest, I knew he was secretly grateful.</p><p>A fortnight earlier, Mr Tiny followed us through the doorway, which collapsed into dust after him. There'd been a brief moment of disorientation when I stepped through, a grey cloud obscuring my vision. As the cloud cleared, I saw that I was standing in a round, shallow, lifeless valley - and although it had been day when I stepped through the doorway, here it was night, albeit an uncommonly clear night, bright with a full moon and a sky filled with twinkling star clusters.</p><p>\"Where are we?\" Harkat asked, his large green eyes filled with wonder.</p><p>Mr Tiny tapped his nose. \"That would be telling. Now, boys,\" he said, squatting and signalling us to squat beside him. He drew a simple compass in the dust at his feet, and pointed to one of the arrows. \"That's west, as you'll see by the position of the sun tomorrow. Go in that direction until you come to the hunting grounds of a black panther. You have to kill the panther to find out where to go next.\"</p><p>Smiling, he stood and turned to leave.</p><p>\"Wait!\" I stopped him. \"Is that all you're going to tell us?\"</p><p>\"What more would you like to know?\" he asked politely.</p><p>\"Loads!\" I shouted. \"Where are we? How did we get here? What happens if we walk east instead of west? How will Harkat find out who he used to be? And what the hell does a panther have to do with any of it?\"</p><p>Mr Tiny sighed impatiently. \"I thought you would have developed an appreciation for the unknown by now,\" he grumbled. \"Don't you realize how exciting it is to set out on an adventure without any idea of what's coming next? I'd give my wellies and glasses to experience the world the way you do, as something strange and challenging.\"</p><p>\"Forget the wellies and glasses!\" I snapped. \"Just give with some answers!\"</p><p>\"You can be very rude sometimes,\" Mr Tiny complained, but squatted again and paused thoughtfully. \"There's much I can't and won't tell you. You'll have to discover for yourselves where we are - although it won't make much difference if you don't. You got here, obviously, through a mechanism either of magic or incredibly evolved technology - I'm not saying which. If you don't follow the trail west, you'll die, probably quite horribly. As for Harkat finding out who he is, and the panther ?\"</p><p>Mr Tiny considered the question in silence, before answering. \"Somewhere on this world lies a lake - more a glorified pond, really - which I like to refer to as the Lake of Souls. In it you can glimpse the faces of many trapped souls, people whose spirits did not leave Earth when they died. The soul of the person Harkat used to be lies within. You must find the Lake, then fish for his soul. If you succeed, and Harkat learns and acknowledges the truth about himself, your quest will be complete and I'll see that you're guided safely home. If not ?\" He shrugged.</p><p>\"How do we find this Lake - of Souls?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"By following instructions,\" Mr Tiny said. \"If you locate and kill the panther, you'll learn where to go next. You'll also discover a clue to your previous identity, which I've been gracious enough to toss in for free.\"</p><p>\"Couldn't you just cut the crap and tell us?\" I groaned.</p><p>\"No,\" Mr Tiny said. He stood and looked down at us seriously. \"But I'll say this much, boys - the panther's the least of your worries. Step warily, trust in your instincts, and never let your guard down. And don't forget,\" he added to Harkat, \"as well as learning who you were, you must acknowledge it. I can't step in until you've admitted the truth out loud.</p><p>\"Now,\" he smiled, \"I really must be going. Places to be, things to do, people to torment. If you've further questions, they'll have to wait. Until next time, boys.\" With a wave, the short, mysterious man turned and left us, walking east until the darkness swallowed him, stranding us in the unnamed, alien land.</p><p>We found a small pool of water and drank deeply from it, sinking our heads into the murky liquid, ignoring the many tiny eels and insects. Harkat's grey skin looked like damp cardboard when he pulled up, having drunk his fill, but it swiftly resumed its natural colour as the water evaporated under the unforgiving sun.</p><p>\"How far do you think we've come?\" I groaned, stretching out in the shade of a prickly bush with small purple flowers. This was the first sign of vegetation we'd encountered, but I was too exhausted to display any active interest.</p><p>\"I've no idea,\" Harkat said. \"How long have we - been travelling?\"</p><p>\"Two weeks - I think.\"</p><p>After the first hot day, we'd tried travelling by night, but the path was rocky and treacherous underfoot - not to mention hard on my bare feet! After stumbling many times, ripping our clothes and cutting ourselves, we elected to brave the blistering sun. I wrapped my jumper around my head to ward off the worst of the rays - the sun didn't affect Harkat's grey skin, though he sweated a lot - but while that prevented sunstroke, it didn't do much against sunburn. My upper body had been roasted all over, even through the material of my shirt. For a few days I'd been sore and irritable, but I'd recovered quickly - thanks to my healing abilities as a half-vampire - and the red had turned to a dark, protective brown. The soles of my feet had also hardened - I barely noticed the absence of shoes now.</p><p>\"With all the climbing and back tracking we've - had to do, we can't be making more than - a couple of miles an hour,\" Harkat said. \"Allowing for fourteen or fifteen hours of sunlight - per day, we probably cover twenty-five or thirty miles. Over two weeks that's ?\" He frowned as he calculated. \"Maybe four hundred in total.\"</p><p>I nodded feebly. \"Thank the gods we're not human - we wouldn't have lasted a week at this pace, in these conditions.\"</p><p>Harkat sat up and tilted his head left, then right - the Little Person's ears were stitched under the skin of his scalp, so he had to c*ck his head at a sharp angle to listen intently. Hearing nothing, he focused his green eyes on the land around us. After a brief study of the area, he turned towards me. \"Has the smell altered?\" he asked. He didn't have a nose, so he relied on mine.</p><p>I sniffed the air. \"Slightly. It doesn't smell as tangy as it did before.\"</p><p>\"That's because there's less - dust,\" he said, pointing to the hills around us. \"We seem to be leaving the - desert behind. There are a few plants and patches - of dry grass.\"</p><p>\"About time,\" I groaned. \"Let's hope there are animals too - I'll crack up if I have to eat another lizard or bug.\"</p><p>\"What do you think those twelve-legged - insects were that we ate yesterday?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"I've no idea, but I won't be touching them again - my stomach was in bits all night!\"</p><p>Harkat chuckled. \"They didn't bother me. Sometimes it helps to have no - taste buds, and a stomach capable of digesting - almost anything.\"</p><p>Harkat pulled his mask up over his mouth and breathed through it in silence, studying the land ahead. Harkat had spent a lot of time testing the air, and didn't think it was poisonous to him - it was slightly different to the air on Earth, more acidic - but he kept his mask on anyway, to be safe. I'd coughed a lot for the first few days, but I was OK now - my hardened lungs had adapted to the bitter air.</p><p>\"Decided where we are yet?\" I asked after a while. That was our favourite topic of conversation. We'd narrowed the possibilities down to four options. Mr Tiny had somehow sent us back into the past. He'd transported us to some far-off world in our own universe. He'd slipped us into an alternate reality. Or this was an illusion, and our bodies were lying in a field in the real world, while Mr Tiny fed this dream scene into our imaginations.</p><p>\"I believed in the - illusion theory at first,\" Harkat said, lowering his mask. \"But the more I consider it, the less - certain I am. If Mr Tiny was making this world up, I think - he'd make it more exciting and colourful. It's quite drab.\"</p><p>\"It's early days,\" I grunted. \"This is probably just to warm us up.\"</p><p>\"It certainly warmedyou up,\" Harkat grinned, nodding at my tan.</p><p>I returned his smile, then stared up at the sun. \"Another three or four hours till nightfall,\" I guessed. \"It's a shame neither of us knows more about star systems, or we might be able to tell where we were by the stars.\"</p><p>\"It's a bigger shame that we - don't have weapons,\" Harkat noted. He stood and studied the land in front of us again. \"How will we defend ourselves against the - panther without weapons?\"</p><p>\"Something will turn up,\" I reassured him. \"Mr Tiny wouldn't throw us in out of our depth, not this early on - it'd spoil his fun if we perished quickly.\"</p><p>\"That's not very comforting,\" Harkat said. \"The idea that we're being kept alive - only to die horribly later, for Mr Tiny's benefit - doesn't fill me with joy.\"</p><p>\"Me neither,\" I agreed. \"But at least it gives us hope.\"</p><p>On that uncertain note, the conversation drew to a close, and after a short rest we filled our meagre lizard-skin pouches with water and marched on through the wasteland, which grew more lush - but no less alien - the further we progressed.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>AWEEKafter leaving the desert behind, we entered a jungle of thick cactus plants, long snaking vines, and stunted, twisted trees. Very few leaves grew on the trees. Those that did were long and thin, a dull orange colour, grouped near the tops of the trees.</p><p>We'd come across traces of animals - droppings, bones, hair - but didn't see any until we entered the jungle. There we found a curious mix of familiar yet strange creatures. Most of the animals were similar to those of Earth - deer, squirrels, monkeys - but different, usually in size or colouring. Some of the differences weren't so readily apparent - we captured a squirrel one day, which turned out to have an extra set of sharp teeth when we examined it, and surprisingly long claws.</p><p>We'd picked up dagger-shaped stones during the course of our trek, which we'd sharpened into knives. We now made more weapons out of thick sticks and bones of larger animals. They wouldn't be much use against a panther, but they helped us frighten off the small yellow monkeys which jumped from trees on to the heads of their victims, blinded them with their claws and teeth, then finished them off as they stumbled around.</p><p>\"I never heard of monkeys like that,\" I remarked one morning as we watched a group of the simians bring down and devour a huge boar-like animal.</p><p>\"Me neither,\" Harkat said.</p><p>As we watched, the monkeys paused and sniffed the air suspiciously. One ran to a thick bush and screeched threateningly. There was a deep grunt from within the bush, then a larger monkey - like a baboon, only an odd red colour - stepped out and shook a long arm at the others. The yellow monkeys bared their teeth, hissed and threw twigs and small pebbles at the newcomer, but the baboon ignored them and advanced. The smaller monkeys retreated, leaving the baboon to finish off the boar.</p>","<p>\"I guess size matters,\" I muttered wryly, then Harkat and I slipped away and left the baboon to feed in peace.</p><p>The next night, while Harkat slept - his nightmares had stopped since coming to this new world - and I stood guard, there was a loud, fierce roar from somewhere ahead of us. The night was usually filled with the nonstop sounds of insects and other nocturnal creatures, but at the roar all noise ceased. There was total silence - once the echoes of the roar subsided - for at least five minutes.</p><p>Harkat slept through the roar. He was normally a light sleeper, but the air here agreed with him and he'd been dozing more deeply. I told him about it in the morning.</p><p>\"You think it was - our panther?\" he asked.</p><p>\"It was definitely a big cat,\" I said. \"It might have been a lion or tiger, but my money's on the black panther.\"</p><p>\"Panthers are usually very quiet,\" Harkat said. \"But I guess they could be - different here. If this is his territory, he should come by - this way soon. Panthers are on constant patrol. We must prepare.\" During his time in Vampire Mountain, when he'd been working for Seba Nile, Harkat had spoken with several vampires who'd hunted or fought with lions and leopards, so he knew quite a lot about them. \"We must dig a pit to - lure it into, catch and truss a deer, and also find some - porcupines.\"</p><p>\"Porcupines?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Their quills can stick in the panther's - paws, snout and mouth. They might slow it down or - distract it.\"</p><p>\"We're going to need more than porcupine quills to kill a panther,\" I noted.</p><p>\"With luck, we'll startle it when - it comes to feed on the deer. We can jump out and frighten it into - the pit. Hopefully it will die there.\"</p><p>\"And if it doesn't?\" I asked.</p><p>Harkat grinned edgily. \"We're in trouble. Black panthers are really leopards, and leopards are - the worst of the big cats. They're fast, strong, savage and - great climbers. We won't be able to outrun it or - climb higher than it.\"</p><p>\"So if plan A fails, there's no plan B?\"</p><p>\"No.\" Harkat chuckled dryly. \"It'll be straight to plan B ?Panic !\"</p><p>We found a clearing with a thick bush at one end where we'd be able to hide. We spent the morning digging a deep pit with our hands and the rough tools we'd fashioned from branches and bones. When the pit was done, we harvested a couple of dozen thick branches and sharpened the tips, creating stakes that we were going to place in the base of the pit.</p><p>As we were climbing into the pit to plant the stakes, I stopped at the edge and started to tremble - remembering another pit that had been filled with stakes, and the friend I'd lost there.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" Harkat asked. Before I could answer, he read it in my eyes. \"Oh,\" he sighed. \"Mr Crepsley.\"</p><p>\"Isn't there any other way to kill it?\" I groaned.</p><p>\"Not without proper equipment.\" Harkat took my stakes from me and smiled encouragingly. \"Go hunt for porcupines. I'll handle this - end of the operation.\"</p><p>Nodding gratefully, I left Harkat to plant the stakes and went looking for porcupines or anything else to use against the panther. I hadn't thought much about Mr Crepsley lately - this harsh world had demanded my full attention - but the pit brought it all crashing back. Again I saw him drop and heard his screams as he died. I wanted to leave the pit and panther, but that wasn't an option. We had to kill the predator to learn where to go next. So I quashed thoughts of Mr Crepsley as best I could and immersed myself in work.</p><p>I picked some of the sturdier cacti to use as missiles against the black panther, and made mud-balls using leaves and fresh mud from a nearby stream - I hoped the mud might temporarily blind the panther. I searched hard for porcupines, but if any were in the vicinity, they were keeping an ultra low profile. I had to report back quill-less to Harkat in the afternoon.</p><p>\"Never mind,\" he said, sitting by the edge of the completed pit. \"Let's create a cover for this and - catch a deer. After that we're in the lap - of the gods.\"</p><p>We built a thin cover for the pit out of long twigs and leaves, laid it over the hole and went hunting. The deer here were shorter than those on Earth, with longer heads. They couldn't run as fast as their Earth counterparts, but were still pretty swift. It took a while to track down a lame straggler and bring it back alive. It was dusk by the time we tied it to a stake close to the pit, and we were both tired after our long, taxing day.</p><p>\"What happens if the panther attacks during the night?\" I asked, sheltering under a skin I'd sliced from a deer with a small stone scraper.</p><p>\"Why do you always have to anticipate - the worst?\" Harkat grumbled.</p><p>\"Somebody has to,\" I laughed. \"Will it be plan B time?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Harkat sighed. \"If he comes in the dark, it's - KYAG time.\"</p><p>\"KYAG?\" I echoed.</p><p>\"Kiss Your Ass Goodbye!\"</p><p>There was no sign of the panther that night, though we both heard deep-throated growls, closer than the roars of the night before. As soon as dawn broke, we ate a hasty breakfast - berries we'd picked after seeing monkeys eat them - and positioned ourselves in the thick covering bush opposite the staked deer and pit. If all went according to plan, the panther would attack the deer. With luck it'd come at it from the far side of the pit and fall in. If not, we'd leap up whilstit was dragging off the deer and hopefully force it backwards to its doom. Not the most elaborate plan in the world, but it would have to do.</p><p>We said nothing as the minutes turned to hours, silently waiting for the panther. My mouth was dry and I sipped frequently from the squirrel skin beakers (we'd replaced the lizard-skin containers) by my side, though only small amounts - to cut out too many toilet trips.</p><p>About an hour after midday I laid a hand on Harkat's grey arm and squeezed warningly - I'd seen something long and black through the trees. Both of us stared hard. As we did, I saw the tip of a whiskered nose stick out from around a tree and sniff the air testingly - the panther! I kept my mouth closed, willing the panther to advance, but after a few hesitant seconds it turned and padded away into the gloom of the jungle.</p><p>Harkat and I looked questioningly at one another. \"It must have smelt us,\" I whispered.</p><p>\"Or sensed something wrong,\" Harkat whispered back. Lifting his head slightly, he studied the grazing deer by the pit, then jerked a thumb backwards. \"Let's get further away. I think it will return. If we aren't here, it might be - tempted to attack.\"</p><p>\"We won't have a clear view if we withdraw any further,\" I noted.</p><p>\"I know,\" Harkat said, \"but we've no choice. It knew something was wrong. If we stay here, it'll also know when - it returns, and won't come any closer.\"</p><p>I followed Harkat as he wriggled further back into the bush, not stopping until we were almost at the end of the briars and vines. From here we could only vaguely see the deer.</p><p>An hour passed. Two. I was beginning to abandon hope that the panther would return, when the sound of deep breathing drifted towards us from the clearing. I caught flashes of the deer jumping around, straining to break free of its rope. Something growled throatily - the panther. Even more promising - the growls were coming from the far side of the pit. If the panther attacked the deer from there, it would fall straight into our trap!</p><p>Harkat and I lay motionless, barely breathing. We heard twigs snap as the panther closed in on the deer, not masking its sounds any longer. Then there was a loud snapping sound as a heavy body crashed through the covering over the pit and landed heavily on the stakes. There was a ferocious howl and I had to cover my ears with my hands. That was followed by silence, disturbed only by the pounding of the deer's hooves on the soil as it leapt around by the edge of the pit.</p><p>Harkat slowly got to his feet and stared over the bush at the open pit. I stood and stared with him. We glanced at each other and I said uncertainly, \"It worked.\"</p><p>\"You sound like you didn't - expect it to,\" Harkat grinned.</p><p>\"I didn't,\" I laughed, and started towards the pit.</p><p>\"Careful,\" Harkat warned me, hefting a knobbly, heavy wooden club. \"It could still be alive. There's nothing more dangerous than - a wounded animal.\"</p><p>\"It'd be howling with pain if it was alive,\" I said.</p><p>\"Probably,\" Harkat nodded, \"but let's not take any - needless risks.\" Stepping in front of me, he moved off to the left and signalled me to go right. Raising a knife-like piece of bone, I circled away from Harkat, then we slowly closed on the pit from opposite directions. As we got nearer, we each drew one of the small cacti we'd tied to our waists - we also had mud-balls strapped on - to toss like grenades if the panther was still alive.</p><p>Harkat came within sight of the pit before I did and stopped, confused. As I got closer, I saw what had bewildered him. I also drew to a halt, not sure what to make of it. A body lay impaled on the stakes, blood dripping from its many puncture wounds. But it wasn't the body of a panther - it was a red baboon.</p><p>\"I don't understand,\" I muttered. \"Monkeys can't make the kind of growling or howling sounds we heard.\"</p><p>\"But how did ?\" Harkat stopped and fear flashed into his eyes. \"The monkeys throat!\" he gasped. \"It's been ripped open! The panther must?\"</p><p>He got no further. Even as I was leaping to the same conclusion - the panther had killed the baboon and dropped it into the pit to fool us! - there was a blur of movement in the upper branches of the tree closest to me. Whirling, I caught a very brief glimpse of a long, thick, pure black object flying through the air with outstretched claws and gaping jaws - then the panther was upon me, roaring triumphantly as it dragged me to the ground for the kill.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>THE ROARwas critical. If the panther had clamped its fangs clean around my throat, I wouldn't have stood a chance. But the animal was excited - probably by having outsmarted us - and tossed its head, growling savagely as we rolled over and came to a stop with the powerful beast on top of me.</p><p>As it roared, Harkat reacted with cool speed and launched a cactus missile. It could have bounced off the animal's head or shoulders, but the luck of the vampires was with us, and the cactus sailed clean between the panther's fearsome jaws.</p><p>The panther instantly lost interest in me and lurched aside, spitting and scratching at the cactus stuck in its mouth. I crawled away, panting, scrabbling for the knife I'd dropped. Harkat leapt over me as my fingers closed around the handle of the bone, and brought his club down upon the head of the panther.</p><p>If the club had been made of tougher material, Harkat would have killed the panther - he could do immense damage with most axes or clubs. But the wood he'd carved it from proved unworthy of the task, and the club smashed in half as it cracked over the panther's hard skull.</p><p>The panther howled with pain and rage, and turned on Harkat, spitting spines, its yellow teeth reflecting the gleam of the afternoon sun. It swiped at his squat grey head and opened up a deep gash down the left side of his face. Harkat fell backwards from the force of the blow and the panther leapt after him.</p><p>I didn't have time to get up and lunge after the panther - it would be on Harkat before I crossed the space between us - so I sent my knife flying through the air at it. The bone deflected harmlessly off the creature's powerful flanks, but it distracted the beast and its head snapped around. Harkat used the moment to grab a couple of the mud-balls hanging from his blue robes. When the panther faced him again, Harkat let it have the mud-balls between the eyes.</p><p>The panther squealed and turned a sharp ninety degrees away from Harkat. It scraped at its eyes with its left paw, wiping the mud away. As it was doing that, Harkat grabbed the lower half of his broken club and jammed the splintered end into the panthers ribcage. The club penetrated the panther's body, but only slightly, drawing blood but not puncturing the panther's lungs.</p><p>That was too much for the panther - it went berserk. Even thoughit couldn't see properly, it threw itself at Harkat, hissing and spitting, swiping with its deadly claws. Harkat ducked out of the way, but the panther's claws snagged on the hem of his robes. Before he could free himself, the predator was on him, working blindly, its teeth gnashing together in search of Harkat's face.</p><p>Harkat wrapped his arms tight around the panther and squeezed, trying to snap its ribs or suffocate it. While he did that, I leapt on the panther's back and raked at its nose and eyes with another cactus head. The panther caught the cactus with its teeth and ripped it clear of my grasp - almost taking my right thumb with it!</p><p>\"Get off!\" Harkat wheezed as I clung to the panther's heaving shoulders and scrabbled for another cactus.</p><p>\"I think I can?\" I started to shout.</p><p>\"Off!\" Harkat roared.</p><p>There was no arguing with a cry like that. I let go of the panther and slumped to the ground. As I did, Harkat locked his hands even tighter together and spun, looking for the pit through the green blood streaming into his wide left eye. Finding it, he clutched the struggling panther close to his chest, stumbled towards the pit - and threw himself in!</p><p>\"Harkat!\" I screamed, reaching out automatically, as though I could grab and save him. The picture of Mr Crepsley falling into the pit of stakes in the Cavern of Retribution flashed through my head, and my insides turned to lead.</p><p>There was an ugly thud and an agonizing screech as the panther was impaled on the stakes. No sound came from Harkat, which made me think he'd landed beneath the panther and died instantly.</p><p>\"No!\" I moaned, picking myself up and hobbling towards the edge of the pit. I was so worried about Harkat that I almost toppled into the pit myself! As I stood on the edge, arms swinging wildly to correct my balance, there was a low groan and I saw Harkat's head turn. He'd landed on top of the panther - he was alive!</p>","<p>\"Harkat!\" I shouted again, joyously this time.</p><p>\"Help - me - up,\" he gasped. The panther's limbs were still twitching, but they no longer presented a threat - it was nearing the final stages of its death throes and wouldn't have had the strength to kill Harkat even if it wished to.</p><p>Lying on my stomach, I reached down into the pit and offered Harkat my hand, but he couldn't reach. He was lying flat on the panther, and although the creature - and the baboon underneath - had taken the worst of the stakes, several had pierced Harkat, a few in his legs, a couple in his stomach and chest, and one through the flesh of his upper left arm. The wounds to his legs and body didn't look too serious. The one through his arm was the problem - he was stuck on the stake and couldn't raise his right hand high enough to clutch mine.</p><p>\"Wait there,\" I said, looking around for something to lower to him.</p><p>\"As if - I could go - anywhere!\" I heard him mutter sarcastically.</p><p>We didn't have any rope, but there were plenty of strong vines growing nearby. Hurrying to the nearest, I sawed at it with my fingernails, cutting off a two metre length. I grabbed it tightly near both ends and tugged sharply to test it. The vine didn't snap under the strain, so I returned to the pit and fed down one end to Harkat. The Little Person grabbed it with his free right hand, waited until I'd got a good grip on my end, then yanked his left arm free of the stake. He gasped tightly as his flesh slid off the piercing wood. Grasping the vine tight, he swung his feet on to the wall of the pit and walked up it, pulling on the vine at the same time.</p><p>Harkat was almost at the top when his feet slipped. As his legs dropped, I realized his falling weight would drag us both down if I held on to the rope. I released it with snake-like speed, collapsed to my stomach and clutched for Harkat's hands.</p><p>I missed his hands, but my fingers closed on the left sleeve of his blue robes. There was a terrifying ripping sound and I thought I'd lost him, but the material held, and after a few dangerous, dangling seconds I was able to haul the Little Person up out of the pit.</p><p>Rolling on to his back, Harkat stared up at the sky, his grey, stitched-together face looking even more like a corpse's than usual. I tried to get up, but my legs were trembling, so I flopped beside him and the two of us lay there in silence, breathing heavily, marvelling inwardly at the fact that we were still alive.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>IPATCHEDHarkat up as best I could, cleaning out his wounds with water from the stream, slicing my jumper into strips to use as bandages. If I'd been a full-vampire I could have used my spit to close his cuts, but as a half-vampire I lacked that ability.</p><p>The wounds to his face - where the panther had clawed him - should have been stitched, but neither of us had any thread or needles. I suggested improvising and using a small bone and animal hair, but Harkat waved the idea away. \"I've enough stitches,\" he grinned. \"Let it heal as it likes. I can't get any uglier - than I already am.\"</p><p>\"That's true,\" I agreed, and laughed as he swatted me round the back of my head. I swiftly grew serious again. \"If infection sets in ?\"</p><p>\"Looking on the bright side as usual,\" he groaned, then shrugged. \"If it sets in, I'm finished - no - hospitals here. Let's not worry - about it.\"</p><p>I helped Harkat to his feet and we returned to the edge of the pit to gaze down at the panther. Harkat was limping worse than normal - he'd always had a slight limp in his left leg - but he said he wasn't in much pain. The panther was a metre and a half in length and thickly built. As we stared at it, I could hardly believe we'd bested it in the fight. Not for the first time in my life, I got the feeling that if vampire gods existed, they were keeping a close watch on me and lending a helping hand whenever I strayed out of my depth.</p><p>\"You know what worries me - the most?\" Harkat asked after a while. \"Mr Tiny said the panther was - theleast of our worries. That means there's worse ahead!\"</p><p>\"Now who's being pessimistic?\" I snorted. \"Want me to go down and get the panther out?\"</p><p>\"Let's wait until morning,\" Harkat said. \"We'll build a good fire, eat, rest - and drag the panther - up tomorrow.\"</p><p>That sounded good to me, so while Harkat made a fire - using flinty stones to create sparks - I butchered the deer and set about carving it up. Once upon a time I might have let the deer go, but vampires are predators. We hunt and kill without remorse, the same as any other animal of the wilds.</p><p>The meat, when we cooked it, was tough, stringy and unappealing, but we ate ravenously, both aware of how fortunate we were not tobe the main course that night.</p><p>I climbed down into the pit in the morning and prised the panther off the stakes. Leaving the baboon where it lay I passed the panther's carcass up to Harkat. It wasn't as easy as it sounds - the panther was very heavy - but we were stronger than humans, so it wasn't one of our harder tasks.</p><p>We studied the panther's gleaming black corpse, wondering how it would tell us where to go. \"Maybe we have to slice it open,\" I suggested. \"There might be a box or canister inside.\"</p><p>\"Worth trying,\" Harkat agreed, and rolled the panther over on its back, presenting us with its smooth, soft stomach.</p><p>\"Wait!\" I shouted as Harkat prepared to make the first cut. The hair on the panther's underside wasn't quite as dark as elsewhere. I could see the stretched skin of its stomach - and there was something drawn on it! I searched among our makeshift knives for one with a long, straight edge, then scraped away some of the hairs on the dead panthers stomach. Thin raised lines were revealed.</p><p>\"That's just scar tissue,\" Harkat said.</p><p>\"No,\" I disagreed. \"Look at the circular shapes and the way they spread out. They've been carved deliberately. Help me scrape the entire stomach clear.\"</p><p>It didn't take long to shave the panther and reveal a detailed map. It must have been gouged into the panther's stomach many years ago, maybe when it was a cub. There was a small X at the extreme right of the map, which seemed to indicate our current position. Towards the left an area was circled, and something had been written within the circle.</p><p>\"Go to the home of the worlds largest toad,\" I read aloud. \"Grab the gelatinous globes.\"</p><p>That's all it said. We read it a few more times, then shared a puzzled look. \"Any idea what 'gelatinous' means?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"I think it's got something to do with jelly,\" I answered uncertainly.</p><p>\"So we've got to find the world's - largest toad, and grab globes made out of jelly?\" Harkat sounded dubious.</p><p>\"This is Mr Tiny we're dealing with,\" I reminded him. \"He makes jokes out of everything. I think our best bet's simply to follow the map from here to the circle and worry about the rest once we get there.\"</p><p>Harkat nodded, then set about the panther's stomach with a sharp stone knife, cutting free the map. \"Here,\" I stopped him. \"Let me. I've got nimbler fingers.\"</p><p>As I carefully cut around the edges of the map and sliced the panther's flesh away from its insides, Harkat strolled around the dead beast, mulling something over. As I peeled the map free of the panther and wiped the inside of it clean on a patch of grass, Harkat stopped. \"Do you recall Mr Tiny saying he'd - thrown in a clue to my identity?\" he asked.</p><p>I cast my thoughts back. \"Yes. Maybe that's what the message within the circle means.\"</p><p>\"I doubt it,\" Harkat replied. \"Whoever I was before I died, I'm pretty - sure I wasn't a toad!\"</p><p>\"Maybe you're a frog prince,\" I giggled.</p><p>\"Ha bloody ha,\" Harkat said. \"I'm sure the writings got nothing - to do with me. There must be something else.\"</p><p>I studied the dead panther. \"If you want to root around in its guts, feel free,\" I told Harkat. \"I'm content with the map.\"</p><p>Harkat crouched beside me and flexed his stubby grey fingers, intent on ripping out the panthers insides. I shifted away, not wanting to be part of the messy task. As I did, my eyes flicked to the panthers mouth. Its lips were curled up over its teeth in a frozen death snarl. I laid a hand on Harkat's left arm and said softly, \"Look.\"</p><p>When Harkat saw what I was pointing at, he reached over to the panther's mouth and prised its stiff lips entirely clear of its fangs. There were small black letters etched into most of the creature's teeth - an A, a K, an M and others. \"There!\" Harkat grunted with excitement. \"That must be it.\"</p><p>\"I'll hold the head up,\" I said, \"so that you can read all the?\"</p><p>But before I'd finished, Harkat had grasped one of the panther's largest teeth with his fingers and attacked its gums with a knife held in his right. I saw that he was fixed on extracting all the teeth, so I left him to it while he hacked them loose.</p><p>When Harkat was done, he took the teeth to the stream and washed them clean of blood. When he returned, he scattered the teeth on the ground and we bent over them to try and decipher the mystery. There were eleven teeth in all, host to a variety of letters. I arranged them alphabetically so that we could see exactly what we had. There were two A's, followed by a single D, H, K, L, M, R, S, T and U.</p><p>\"We must be able to make a - message out of them,\" Harkat said.</p><p>\"Eleven letters,\" I mused. \"It can't be a very long message. Let's see what we can come up with.\" I shifted the letters around until I got three words - ASK MUD RAT - with two letters left over, H and L.</p><p>Harkat tried and got SLAM DARK HUT. .</p><p>As I was juggling them around again, Harkat groaned, pushed me aside and began rearranging the teeth purposefully. \"Have you worked it out?\" I asked, slightly disappointed that he'd beaten me to the punch.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he said, \"but it's not a clue - just Mr Tiny - being smug.\" He finished laying out the teeth and waved at them bitterly - HARKAT MULDS.</p><p>\"What's the point of that?\" I grumbled. \"That's a waste of time.\"</p><p>\"Mr Tiny loves playing with time,\" Harkat sighed, then wrapped the teeth in a piece of cloth and tucked them away inside his robes.</p><p>\"What are you hanging on to them for?\" I asked.</p><p>\"They're sharp,\" Harkat said. \"They might come in useful.\" He stood and walked over to where the map was drying in the sun. \"Will we be able to use this?\" he asked, studying the lines and squiggles.</p><p>\"If it's accurate,\" I replied.</p><p>\"Then let's get going,\" Harkat said, rolling the map up and sticking it inside his robes along with the teeth. \"I'm anxious to meet the world's - largest toad.\" He looked at me and grinned. \"And to see if there's any - family resemblance.\"</p><p>Laughing, we broke camp quickly and set off through the trees, eager to leave behind the clouds of flies and insects gathering to feast on the corpse of the defeated lord of the jungle.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>ABOUT THREEweeks later, we came to the edge of a huge swamp - the area marked on the map by the circle. It had been a relatively easy trek. The map had been plainly drawn and was simple to follow. Though the terrain was tricky to negotiate - lots of wiry bushes to cut through - it didn't present any life-threatening problems. Harkat's wounds had healed without complications but he was left with three very noticeable scars on the left side of his face - almost as if he'd been marked by an especially eager vampaneze!</p><p>A foul smell of putrid water and rotting plants emanated from the swamp. The air was thick with flying insects. As we stood and watched, we spotted a couple of water snakes attack, kill and devour a large rat with four yellow eyes.</p><p>\"I don't like the look of this,\" I muttered.</p><p>\"You haven't seen the worst yet,\" Harkat said, pointing to a small island off to our left, jutting out of the waters of the swamp. I couldn't see what he was talking about at first - the island was bare except for three large logs - but then one of the \"logs\" moved.</p><p>\"Alligators!\" I hissed.</p><p>\"Very bad news foryou,\" Harkat said.</p><p>\"Why me in particular?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Iwrestled the panther,\" he grinned. \"The alligators areyours .\"</p><p>\"You've a warped sense of humour, Mulds,\" I growled, then stepped back from the edge of the swamp. \"Let's circle around and try to find the toad.\"</p><p>\"You know it's not going to be - on the outskirts,\" Harkat said. \"We'll have to wade in.\"</p><p>\"I know,\" I sighed, \"but let's at least try and find an entry spot that isn't guarded by alligators. We won't get very far if that lot get a whiff of us.\"</p><p>We walked for hours along the rim of the swamp, without sight or sound of a toad, though we did find lots of small brown frogs. We saw plenty more snakes and alligators too. Finally we came to a section with no visible predators. The water was shallow and slightly less pungent than elsewhere. It was as good a place as any to wet our toes.</p><p>\"I wish I had Mr Tiny's - Wellington boots,\" Harkat grumbled, knotting the hem of his blue robes above his knees.</p><p>\"Me too,\" I sighed, rolling up the bottoms of my jeans. I paused as I was about to set foot in the water. \"I just thought of something. This stretch of swamp could be full of piranha - that might be why there are no alligators or snakes!\"</p><p>Harkat stared at me with something close to loathing in his round green eyes. \"Why can't you keep stupid thoughts - like that to yourself?\" he snapped.</p><p>\"I'm serious,\" I insisted. I got down on my hands and knees and peered into the still waters of the swamp, but it was too cloudy to see anything.</p><p>\"I think piranha only attack when - they scent blood,\" Harkat said. \"If there are piranha, we should - be OK as long as we don't cut ourselves.\"</p>","<p>\"It's times like these that I really hate Mr Tiny,\" I groaned. But since there was nothing else for it, I stepped into the swamp. I paused, ready to leap out at the first hint of a bite, then waded ahead cautiously, Harkat following close behind.</p><p>A few hours later, as dusk was lengthening, we found an uninhabited island. Harkat and I hauled ourselves out of the swampy water and collapsed with exhaustion. We then slept, me sheltered beneath the deer blanket I'd been using these last few weeks, Harkat beneath the fleshy map we'd stripped from the black panther's stomach. But we didn't sleep deeply. The swamp was alive with noises - insects, frogs and the occasional unidentifiable splash. We were bleary-eyed and shivering when we rose the following morning.</p><p>One good thing about the filthy swamp was that the water level remained fairly low. Every so often we'd hit a dip and one or both of us would slip and disappear under the murky water, only to bob up spluttering and cursing moments later. But most of the time the water didn't reach higher than our thighs. Another bonus was that although the swamp was teeming with insects and leeches, they didn't bother us - our skin was obviously too tough and our blood off-putting.</p><p>We avoided the alligators, circling far around them whenever we saw one. Although we were attacked several times by snakes, we were too quick and strong for them. But we had to remain on constant alert - one slip could be the end of us.</p><p>\"No piranha so far,\" Harkat noted as we rested. We'd been working our way through a long swath of tall reeds, full of irritating sticky seeds which had stuck to my hair and clothes.</p><p>\"In cases like this, I'm delighted to be proved wrong,\" I said.</p><p>\"We could spend months - searching for this toad,\" Harkat commented.</p><p>\"I don't think it'll take that long,\" I said. \"By the law of averages, it should take ages to locate anything specific in a swamp this size. But Mr Tiny has a way of fiddling with laws. He wants us to find the toad, so I'm sure we will.\"</p><p>\"If that's the case,\" Harkat mused, \"maybe we should just - do nothing and wait for the toad to - come to us.\"</p><p>\"It doesn't work that way,\" I said. \"Mr Tiny's set this up, but we have to sweat to make it happen. If we sat on the edge of the swamp - or if we hadn't marched west when he said - we'd lose touch with the game and would no longer be under his influence - meaning he couldn't stack the odds in our favour.\"</p><p>Harkat studied me curiously. \"You've been thinking about this - a lot,\" he remarked.</p><p>\"Not much else to do in this godsforsaken world,\" I laughed.</p><p>Flicking off the last of the seeds, we rested a few more minutes, then set off, silent and grim-faced, wading through the murky waters, our eyes peeled for predators as we moved ever further into the heart of the swamp.</p><p>As the sun was setting, a deep-throated croaking noise drifted to us from the middle of an island covered by thick bushes and gnarly trees. We knew at once that it was our toad, just as we'd instantly recognized the panther by its roar. Wading up to the rim of the island, we paused to consider our options.</p><p>\"The sun will be gone in a few - minutes,\" Harkat said. \"Perhaps we should wait for - morning.\"</p><p>\"But the moon will be almost full tonight,\" I pointed out. \"This might be as good a time as any to act - bright enough for us to see, but dark enough for us to hide.\"</p><p>Harkat looked at me quizzically. \"You sound as though you - fear this toad.\"</p><p>\"Remember Evanna's frogs?\" I asked, referring to a group of frogs that guarded the witch's home. They had sacs of poison along the sides of their tongues - it was deadly if it got into your bloodstream. \"I know this is a toad, not a frog, but we'd be fools to take it for granted.\"</p><p>\"OK,\" Harkat said. \"We'll go in when the moon's up. If we don't like the - look of it, we can return tomorrow.\"</p><p>We crouched on the edge of the island while the moon rose and illuminated the night sky. Then, drawing our weapons - a knife for me, a spear for Harkat - we pushed through the damp overhanging fronds and crept slowly past the various trees and plants. After several minutes we came to a clearing at the centre of the island, where we paused under cover of a bush and gawped at the spectacular sight ahead.</p><p>A wide moat ran around a curved mound of mud and reeds. To the left and right of the moat, alligators lay in wait, four or five on each side. On the mound in the middle lay the toad - and it was amonster ! Two metres long, with a huge, knobbly body, an immense head with bulging eyes, and an enormous mouth. Its skin was a dark, crinkled, greeny brown colour. It was pockmarked all over, and out of the holes oozed some sort of slimy yellow pus. Thick black leeches slowly slid up and down its hide, like mobile beauty spots, feeding on the pus.</p><p>As we stared incredulously at the giant toad, a crow-like bird flew by overhead. The toad's head lifted slightly, then its mouth snapped open and its tongue shot out, impossibly long and thick. It snatched the bird from the air. There was a squawk and a flurried flapping of wings. Then the crow disappeared and the toad's jaw moved up and down as it swallowed the hapless bird.</p><p>I was so taken aback by the toad's appearance that I didn't notice the small clear balls surrounding it. It was only when Harkat tapped my arm and pointed that I realized the toad was sitting on what must be the 'gelatinous globes'. We'd have to cross the moat and sneak the globes out from underneath it!</p><p>Withdrawing, we huddled in the shadows of the bushes and trees to discuss our next move. \"Know what we need?\" I whispered to Harkat.</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"The world's biggest jam jar.\"</p><p>Harkat groaned. \"Be serious,\" he chastized me. \"How are we going to get the - globes without that thing taking our heads off?\"</p><p>\"We'll have to sneak up from behind and hope it doesn't notice,\" I said. \"I was watching its tongue when it struck the crow. I didn't spot any poison sacs along the sides.\"</p><p>\"What about the alligators?\" Harkat asked. \"Are they waiting to attack the toad?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said. \"I think they're protecting it or living in harmony with it, like the leeches.\"</p><p>\"I never heard of alligators doing that,\" Harkat noted sceptically.</p><p>\"AndI never heard of a toad bigger than a cow,\" I retorted. \"Who knows how this mad world functions? Maybe all the toads are that size.\"</p><p>The best we could do would be to create a distraction, nip in, grab the globes, and get out again - fast! Retreating to the edge of the island, we waded through the swamp in search of something we could use to distract the alligators. We killed a couple of large water rats, and captured three live creatures unlike anything we'd seen before. They were shaped like turtles, except with see-through, soft shells and nine powerful fins. They were harmless - speed was their single natural defence. We only caught them when they became entangled in weeds on a mud bank as we were chasing them.</p><p>Returning to the island, we crept up on the monstrous toad at the centre and paused in the bushes. \"I've been thinking,\" Harkat whispered. \"It makes more sense for only - one of us to move on the toad. The other should hold on to the - rats and turtles, and throw them to - the alligators to provide cover.\"</p><p>\"That sounds sensible,\" I agreed. \"Any thoughts on who should go in?\"</p><p>I expected Harkat to volunteer, but he smiled sheepishly and said, \"I thinkyou should go.\"</p><p>\"Oh?\" I replied, momentarily thrown.</p><p>\"You're faster than me,\" Harkat said. \"You stand a better chance of - making it back alive. Of course, if you - don't want to ?\"</p><p>\"Don't be stupid,\" I grunted. \"I'll do it. Just make sure you keep those 'gators occupied.\"</p><p>\"I'll do my best,\" Harkat said, then slipped off to the left, to find the ideal position to launch the rats and turtle-like creatures.</p><p>I nudged my way around to the rear of the toad, so I could sneak up on it without being seen, and wriggled down to the edge of the moat. There was a stick lying nearby which I stuck into the water, testing its depth. It didn't seem deep. I was sure I could wade the six or seven metres towards the toad's base.</p><p>There was a rustling motion off to my left and one of the turtle creatures went zooming through the air, landing amidst the alligators on the far right side. One of the dead rats was quickly hurled among the other alligators on the left of the moat. As soon as the alligators began snapping at each other and fighting for the morsels, I lowered myself into the cold, clammy water. It was filled with soggy twigs, dead insects and slime from the toad's sores. I ignored the disgusting mess and waded across to where the toad was squatting, its eyes fixed on the bickering alligators.</p><p>There were several jelly-like globes near the edge of the toad's perch. I picked up a couple, meaning to stuff them inside my shirt, but their soft shells were broken. They lost their shape and a sticky clear fluid oozed out of them.</p><p>Glancing up, I saw another of the turtles flying through the air, followed by the second dead rat. That meant Harkat only had one of the turtles held in reserve. I had to act fast. Slithering forward on to the mound, I reached for the shiny globes lying closest to the giant toad. Most were covered with pus. It was warm, with the texture of vomit, and the stench made me gag. Holding my breath, I wiped the pus away and found a globe that wasn't broken. I sifted through the shells and found another, then another. The globes were different sizes, some only five or six centimetres in diameter, some twenty centimetres. I packed loads of the globes inside my shirt, working quickly. I'd just about gathered enough when the toad's head turned and I found myself on the end of its fierce, bulging gaze.</p><p>I reacted swiftly and spun away, stumbling back towards the island across the moat. As I lunged to safety, the toad unleashed its tongue and struck me hard on my right shoulder, knocking me flat. I came up gasping, spitting out water and bits of jelly and pus. The toad lashed me with its tongue again, connected with the top of my head and sent me flying a second time. As I came up out of the water, dazed, I caught sight of several objects sliding into the moat beyond the mound. I lost all interest in the toad and its tongue. I had a far greater threat to worry about. The alligators had finished with the scraps Harkat had thrown them. Now they were coming after a fresh snack ?me !</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>TURNING MYback on the alligators, I scrambled for the bank. I might have made it if the toad hadn't struck me again with its tongue, this time whipping the tip of it around my throat and spinning me back towards it. The toad hadn't enough power to pull me all the way to the mound, but I landed close to it. As I sprang to my feet, gasping for breath, I spotted the first of the onrushing alligators and knew I'd never make it to the bank in time.</p><p>Standing my ground, I prepared to meet the alligator's challenge. My aim was to clamp its jaws shut and keep them closed - it couldn't do much damage with its tiny front claws. But even assuming I could do that, I'd no way of dealing with the rest of the pack, which were coming fast on the lead alligator's tail.</p><p>I glimpsed Harkat splashing into the water, rushing to my aid, but the fight would be long over by the time he reached me. The first alligator homed in on me, eyes glinting cruelly, snout lifting as it bared its fangs - so many! so long! so sharp! - to crush me. I drew my hands apart and started bringing them together ?</p><p>? when, on the bank to my right, a figure appeared and screeched something unintelligible while waving its arms high in the air.</p><p>There was a lightning-bright flash in the sky overhead. I instinctively covered my eyes with my hands. When I removed them a few seconds later, I saw that the alligator had missed me and run aground on the bank. The other alligators were all in a muddle, swimming around in circles and crashing into one another. On the mound, the toad had lowered its head and was croaking deeply, paying no attention to me.</p><p>I gazed from the alligators to Harkat - he'd stopped in confusion - then at the figure on the bank. As it lowered its arms, I saw that it was a person - a woman! And as she stepped forward, out of the shadows of the trees, revealing her long straggly hair and body-wrapping ropes, I recognized her.</p><p>\"Evanna?\" I roared in disbelief.</p><p>\"That was pretty finely timed, even by my standards,\" the witch grunted, coming to a halt at the edge of the moat.</p><p>\"Evanna?\" Harkat cried.</p><p>\"Is there an echo?\" the witch sniffed, then glanced around at the alligators and toad. \"I've cast a temporary blinding spell on the creatures, but it won't last long. If you value your lives, get out of there, and quick!\"</p><p>\"But how - what - where ?\" I stuttered.</p><p>\"Let's talk about it on - dry land,\" Harkat said, crossing over to join me, carefully skirting the thrashing alligators. \"Did you get the globes?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said, pulling one out from within my shirt. \"But how did she?\"</p><p>\"Later!\" Harkat snapped, pushing me towards safety.</p><p>Suppressing my questions, I stumbled to the bank and crawled out of the mucky water of the moat. Evanna caught me by the back of my shirt and hauled me to my feet, then grabbed Harkat's robes and pulled him up too. \"Come on,\" she said, retreating. \"We'd best not be here when their sight clears. That toad has a nasty temper and might bound after us.\"</p><p>Harkat and I paused to consider what would happen if a toad that size leapt upon us. Then we hurried after the departing witch as fast as our weary legs could carry us.</p><p>Evanna had established her camp on a grassy isle a few hundred metres from the island of the toad. A fire was burning when we crawled out of the swamp, a vegetable stew bubbling in a pot above it. Replacement clothes were waiting for us, blue robes for Harkat, dark brown trousers and a shirt for me.</p>","<p>\"Get out of those wet rags, get dry, and get dressed,\" Evanna ordered, going to check on the stew.</p><p>Harkat and I stared from the witch, to the fire, to the clothes.</p><p>\"This probably sounds like a stupid question,\" I said, \"but have you been expecting us?\"</p><p>\"Of course,\" Evanna said. \"I've been here for the past week. I guessed you wouldn't arrive that soon, but I didn't want to risk missing you.\"</p><p>\"How did you know we - were coming?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"Please,\" Evanna sighed. \"You know of my magical powers and my ability to predict future events. Don't trouble me with unnecessary questions.\"</p><p>\"So tell us why you're here,\" I encouraged her. \"And why you rescued us. As I recall, you've always said you couldn't get involved in our battles.\"</p><p>\"Not in your fight with the vampaneze,\" Evanna said. \"When it comes to alligators and toads, I have a free hand. Now why don't you change out of your damp clothes and eat some of this delicious stew before you pester me with more of your dratted questions?\"</p><p>Since it was uncomfortable standing therewet and hungry, we did as the witch advised. After a quick meal, as we were licking our fingers clean, I asked Evanna if she could tell us where we were. \"No,\" she said.</p><p>\"Could you transport Darren - back home?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"I'm going nowhere!\" I objected immediately.</p><p>\"You just narrowly survived being - swallowed by alligators,\" Harkat grunted. \"I won't let you risk your - life any?\"</p><p>\"This is a pointless argument,\" Evanna interrupted. \"I don't have the power to transport either of you back.\"</p><p>\"Butyou were able to - come here,\" Harkat argued. \"You must be able to - return.\"</p><p>\"Things aren't as simple as they seem,\" Evanna said. \"I can't explain it without revealing facts which I must keep secret. All I'll say is that I didn't get here the way you did, and I can't open a gateway between the reality you know and this one. Only Desmond Tiny can.\"</p><p>There was no point in quizzing her further - the witch, like Mr Tiny, couldn't be drawn on certain issues - so we dropped it. \"Can you tell us anything about the quest we're on?\" I asked instead. \"Where we have to go next or what we must do?\"</p><p>\"I can tell you that I am to act as your guide on the next stretch of your adventure,\" Evanna said. \"That's why I intervened - since I'm part of your quest, I can play an active role in it, at least for a while.\"</p><p>\"You're coming with us?\" I whooped, delighted at the thought of having someone to show us the way.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Evanna smiled, \"but only for a short time. I will be with you for ten, maybe eleven days. After that you're on your own.\" Rising, she started away from us. \"You may rest now,\" she said. \"Nothing will disturb your slumber here. I'll return in the afternoon and we'll set off.\"</p><p>\"For where?\" Harkat asked. But if the witch heard, she didn't bother to respond, and seconds later she was gone. Since there was nothing else we could do, Harkat and I made rough beds on the grass, lay down and slept.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>AFTER BREAKFAST, Evanna guided us out of the swamp and south across more hard, barren land. It wasn't as lifeless as the desert we'd crossed, but very little grew on the reddish soil, and the animals were tough-skinned and bony.</p><p>Over the days and nights that followed, we slyly probed the witch for clues about where we were, who Harkat had been, what the gelatinous globes were for, and what lay ahead. We slid the questions into ordinary conversations, hoping to catch Evanna off guard. But she was sharp as a snake and never let anything slip.</p><p>Despite her annoying reluctance to reveal anything of our circumstances, she was a welcome travelling companion. She arranged the sleeping quarters every night - she could set up a camp within seconds - and told us what we could and couldn't eat (many of the animals and plants were poisonous or indigestible). She also spun tales and sung songs to amuse us during the long, harsh hours of walking.</p><p>I asked her several times how the War of the Scars was going, and what Vancha March and the other Princes and Generals were up to. She only shook her head at such questions and said this was not the time for her to comment.</p><p>We often discussed Mr Crepsley. Evanna had known the vampire long before I did and was able to tell me what he'd been like as a younger man. I felt sad talking about my lost friend, but it was a warm sort of sadness, not like the cold misery I experienced in the early weeks after he'd died. One night, when Harkat was asleep and snoring loudly (Evanna had confirmed what he'd already suspected - he could breathe the air here - so he'd dispensed with his mask), I asked Evanna if it was possible to communicate with Mr Crepsley. \"Mr Tiny has the power to speak with the dead,\" I said. \"Can you?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" she said, \"but we can only speak to those whose spirits remain trapped on Earth after they die. Most peoples souls move on - though nobody knows for sure where they go, not even my father.\"</p><p>\"So you can't get in touch with Mr Crepsley?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Thankfully, no,\" she smiled. \"Larten has left the realm of the physical for ever. I like to think he is with Arra Sails and his other loved ones in Paradise, awaiting the rest of his friends.\"</p><p>Arra Sails was a female vampire. She and Mr Crepsley had been \"married\" once. She died when a vampire traitor - Kurda Smahlt - sneaked a band of vampaneze into Vampire Mountain. Thinking about Arra and Kurda set me to pondering the past, and I asked Evanna if there'd been any way to avoid the bloody War of the Scars. \"If Kurda had told us about the Lord of the Vampaneze, would it have made a difference? Or what if he'd become a Prince, taken control of the Stone of Blood and forced the Generals to submit to the vampaneze? Would Mr Crepsley be alive? And Arra? And all the others who've died in the war?\"</p><p>Evanna sighed deeply. \"Time is like a jigsaw puzzle,\" she said. \"Imagine a giant box full of billions of pieces of millions of puzzles - that is the future. Beside it lies a huge board, partially filled with bits of the overall puzzle - that is the past. Those in the present reach blindly into the box of the future every time they have a decision to make, draw a piece of the puzzle out and slot it into place on the board. Once a piece has been added, it influences the final shape and design of the puzzle, and it's useless trying to fathom what the puzzle would have looked like if a different piece had been picked.\" She paused. \"Unless you're Desmond Tiny. He spends most of his time considering the puzzle and contemplating alternative patterns.\"</p><p>I thought about that for a long time before speaking again. \"What you're saying is that there's no point worrying about the past, because we can't change it?\"</p><p>\"Basically,\" she nodded, then leant over, one green eye shining brightly, one brown eye gleaming dully. \"A mortal can drive himself mad thinking about the nature of the universal puzzle. Concern yourself only with the problems of the present and you will get along fine.\"</p><p>It was an odd conversation, one I returned to often, not just that night when I was trying to sleep, but during the quieter moments of the testing weeks ahead.</p><p>Eleven days after Evanna had rescued me from the jaws of the alligator, we came to the edge of an immense lake. At first I thought it was a sea - I couldn't see to the far side - but when I tested the water, I found it fresh, although very bitter.</p><p>\"This is where I'll leave you,\" Evanna said, gazing out over the dark blue water, then up into the cloud-filled sky. The weather had changed during the course of our journey - clouds and rain were now the norm.</p><p>\"What's the lake called?\" Harkat asked, hoping - like me - that this was the Lake of Souls, though we both knew in our hearts that it wasn't.</p><p>\"It has no name,\" Evanna said. \"It's a relatively new formation, and the sentient beings of this planet have yet to discover it.\"</p><p>\"You mean there are people here?\" Harkat asked sharply.</p><p>\"Yes,\" the witch replied.</p><p>\"Why haven't we seen any?\" I asked.</p><p>\"This is a large planet,\" Evanna said, \"but people are few. You may run into some before your adventure draws to a close, but don't get sidetracked - you're here to discover the truth about Harkat, not cavort with the natives. Now, would you like a hand making a raft, or would you rather do it yourselves?\"</p><p>\"What will we need a raft for?\" I asked.</p><p>Evanna pointed to the lake. \"Three guesses, genius.\"</p><p>\"Can't we track around it?\" Harkat enquired.</p><p>\"You can, but I don't advise it.\"</p><p>We sighed - when Evanna said something like that, we knew we hadn't much of a choice. \"What will we build it from?\" I asked. \"It's been a few days since I spotted any trees.\"</p><p>\"We're close to the wreck of a boat,\" Evanna said, heading off to the left. \"We can strip it bare and use the wood.\"</p><p>\"I thought you said none of the - people here had found this lake,\" Harkat said, but if the witch heard the query, she paid it no heed.</p><p>About a kilometre up the pebbly lake shore, we found the bleached remains of a small wooden boat. The first planks we pulled off were soggy and rotten, but there were stronger planks underneath. We stacked them in a tidy pile, sorting them by length.</p><p>\"How are we going to bind them?\" I asked when we were ready to begin construction. \"There aren't any nails.\" I wiped rain from my forehead - it had been drizzling steadily for the last hour.</p><p>\"The builder of the boat used mud to bind the planks,\" Evanna said. \"He had no rope or nails, and no intention of sailing the boat - he merely built it to keep himself busy.\"</p><p>\"Mud won't keep a raft together once we - get out on the water,\" Harkat noted dubiously.</p><p>\"Indeed,\" Evanna smirked. \"That's why we are going to tie the planks tightly with ropes.\" The squat witch began unwrapping the ropes she kept knotted around her body.</p><p>\"Do you want us to look away?\" I asked.</p><p>\"No need,\" she laughed. \"I don't plan to strip myself bare!\"</p><p>The witch reeled off an incredibly long line of rope, dozens of metres in length, yet the ropes around her body didn't diminish, and she was as discreetly covered when she stopped as she'd been at the outset. \"There!\" she grunted. \"That should suffice.\"</p><p>We spent the rest of the day constructing the raft, Evanna acting as the designer, performing magical shortcuts when our backs were turned, making our job a lot quicker and easier than it should have been. It wasn't a large raft when finished, two and a half metres long by two wide, but we could both fit on it and lie down in comfort. Evanna wouldn't tell us how wide the lake was, but said we'd have to sail due south and sleep on the raft afew nights at least. The raft floated nicely when we tested it and although we had no sails, we fashioned oars out of leftover planks.</p><p>\"You should be fine now,\" Evanna said. \"You won't be able to light a fire, but fish swim close to the surface of the lake. Catch and eat them raw. And the water is unpleasant but safe to drink.\"</p><p>\"Evanna ?\" I began, then coughed with embarrassment.</p><p>\"What is it, Darren?\" the witch asked.</p><p>\"The gelatinous globes,\" I muttered. \"Will you tell us what they're for?\"</p><p>\"No,\" she said. \"And that's not what you wanted to ask. Out with it, please. What's bothering you?\"</p><p>\"Blood,\" I sighed. \"It's been ages since I last drank human blood. I'm feeling the side effects - I've lost a lot of my sharpness and strength. If I carry on like this, I'll die. I was wondering if I could drink fromyou !\"</p><p>Evanna smiled regretfully. \"I would gladly let you drink from me, but I'm not human and my blood's not fit for consumption - you'd feel a lot worse afterwards! But don't worry. If the fates are kind, you'll find a feeding source shortly. If they're not,\" she added darkly, \"you'll have greater problems to worry about.</p><p>\"Now,\" the witch said, stepping away from the raft, \"I must leave you. The sooner you set off, the sooner you'll arrive at the other side. I've just this to say - I've saved it until now because I had to - and then I'll depart. I can't tell you what the future has in store, but I can offer this advice - to fish in the Lake of Souls, you must borrow a net which has been used to trawl for the dead. And to access the Lake, you'll need the holy liquid from the Temple of the Grotesque.\"</p><p>\"Temple of the Grotesque?\" Harkat and I immediately asked together.</p><p>\"Sorry,\" Evanna grunted. \"I can tell you that much, but nothing else.\" Waving to us, the witch said, \"Luck, Darren Shan. Luck, Harkat Mulds.\" And then, before we could reply, she darted away, moving with magical speed, disappearing out of sight within seconds into the gloom of the coming night.</p><p>Harkat and I stared at one another silently, then turned and manoeuvred our meagre stash of possessions on to the raft. We divided the gelatinous globes into three piles: one for Harkat, one for me and one in a scrap of cloth tied to the raft, then set off in the gathering darkness across the cold, still water of the nameless lake.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>WE ROWEDfor most of the night, in what we hoped was a straight line (there seemed to be no currents to drag us off course), rested for a few hours either side of dawn, then began rowing again, this time navigating south by the position of the sun. By the third day we were bored out of our skulls. There was nothing to do on the calm, open lake, and no change in scenery - dark blue underneath, mostly unbroken grey overhead. Fishing distracted us for short periods each day, but the fish were plentiful and easy to catch, and soon it was back to the rowing and resting.</p>","<p>To keep ourselves amused, we invented games using the teeth Harkat had pulled from the dead panther. There weren't many word games we could play with such a small complement of letters, but by giving each letter a number, we were able to pretend the teeth were dice and indulge in simple gambling games. We didn't have anything of value to bet, so we used the bones of the fish we caught as gambling chips, and made believe they were worth vast amounts of money.</p><p>During a rest period, as Harkat was cleaning the teeth - taking his time, to stretch the job out - he picked up a long incisor, the one marked by a K, and frowned. \"This is hollow,\" he said, holding it up and peering through it. Putting it to his wide mouth, he blew through it, held it up again, then passed it to me.</p><p>I studied the tooth against the grey light of the sky, squinting to see better. \"It's very smooth,\" I noted. \"And it goes from being wide at the top to narrow at the tip.\"</p><p>\"It's almost as though - a hole has been bored through it,\" Harkat said.</p><p>\"How, and what for?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Don't know,\" Harkat said. \"But it's the only one - like that.\"</p><p>\"Maybe an insect did it,\" I suggested. \"A parasite which burrows into an animal's teeth and gnaws its way upwards, feeding on the material inside.\"</p><p>Harkat stared at me for a moment, then opened his mouth as wide as he could and gurgled, \"Check my teeth quick!\"</p><p>\"Mine first!\" I yelped, anxiously probing my teeth with my tongue.</p><p>\"Your teeth are tougher - than mine,\" he said. \"I'm more vulnerable.\"</p><p>Since that was true, I leant forward to examine Harkat's sharp grey teeth. I studied them thoroughly, but there was no sign that any had been invaded. Harkat checked mine next, but I drew a clean bill of health too. We relaxed after that - though we did a lot of prodding and jabbing with our tongues over the next few hours! - and Harkat returned to cleaning the teeth, keeping the tooth with the hole to one side, slightly away from the others.</p><p>That fourth night, as we slept after many hours of rowing, huddled together in the middle of the raft, we were woken by a thunderous flapping sound overhead. We bolted out of our sleep and sat up straight, covering our ears to drown out the noise. The sound was like nothing I'd heard before, impossibly heavy, as though a giant was beating clean his bed sheets. It was accompanied by strong, cool gusts of wind which set the water rippling and our raft rocking. It was a dark night with no break in the clouds, and we couldn't see what was making the noise.</p><p>\"What is it?\" I whispered. Harkat couldn't hear my whisper over the noise, so I repeated myself, but not too loudly, for fear of giving our position away to whatever was above.</p><p>\"No idea,\" Harkat replied, \"but there's something - familiar about it. I've heard it before - but I can't remember where.\"</p><p>The flapping sounds died away as whatever it was moved on, the water calmed and our raft steadied, leaving us shaken but unharmed. When we discussed it later, we reasoned it must have been some huge breed of bird. But in my gut, I sensed that wasn't the answer, and by Harkat's troubled expression and inability to fall back asleep, I was sure he sensed it too.</p><p>We rowed quicker than usual in the morning, saying little about the sounds we'd heard the night before, but gazing up often at the sky. Neither of us could explain why the noise had so alarmed us - we just felt that we'd be in big trouble if the creature came again, by the light of day.</p><p>We spent so much time staring up at the clouds that it wasn't until early afternoon, during a brief rest period, that we looked ahead and realized we were within sight of land. \"How far do you think - it is?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"I'm not sure,\" I answered. \"Four or five kilometres?\" The land was low-lying, but there were mountains further on, tall grey peaks which blended with the clouds, which was why we hadn't noticed them before.</p><p>\"We can be there soon if we - row hard,\" Harkat noted.</p><p>\"So let's row,\" I grunted, and we set to our task with renewed vigour. Harkat was able to row faster than me - my strength was failing rapidly as a result of not having any human blood to drink - but I stuck my head down and pushed my muscles to their full capacity. We were both eager to make the safety of land, where at least we could find a bush to hide under if we were attacked.</p><p>We'd covered about half the distance when the air overhead reverberated with the same heavy flapping sounds that had interrupted our slumber. Gusts of wind cut up the water around us. Pausing, we looked up and spotted something hovering far above. It seemed small, but that was because it was a long way up.</p><p>\"What the hell is it?\" I gasped.</p><p>Harkat shook his head in answer. \"It must be immense,\" he muttered, \"for its wings to create - this much disturbance from that high up.\"</p><p>\"Do you think it's spotted us?\" I asked.</p><p>\"It wouldn't be hovering there otherwise,\" Harkat said.</p><p>The flapping sound and accompanying wind stopped and the figure swooped towards us with frightening speed, becoming larger by the second. I thought it meant to torpedo us, but it pulled out of its dive ten or so metres above the raft. Slowing its descent, it unfurled gigantic wings and flapped to keep itself steady. The sound was ear shattering.</p><p>\"Is that - what I - think it is?\" I roared, clinging to the raft as waves broke over us, eyes bulging out of my head, unable to believe that this monster was real. I wished with all my heart that Harkat would tell me I was hallucinating.</p><p>\"Yes!\" Harkat shouted, shattering my wishes. \"I knew I - recognized it!\" The Little Person crawled to the edge of the raft to gaze at the magnificent but terrifying creature of myth. He was petrified, like me, but there was also an excited gleam in his green eyes. \"I've seen it before - in my nightmares,\" he croaked, his voice only barely audible over the flapping of the extended wings. \"It's adragon !\"</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>I'D NEVERin my life seen anything as wondrous as this dragon, and even though I was struck numb with fear, I found myself admiring it, unable to react to the threat it posed. Though it was impossible to accurately judge its measurements, its wingspan had to be twenty metres. The wings were a patchy light green colour, thick where they connected to its body, but thin at the tips.</p><p>The dragon's body was seven or eight metres from snout to the tip of its tail. It put me in mind of a snakes tapered body - it was scaled - though it had a round bulging chest which angled back towards the tail. Its scales were a dull red and gold colour underneath. From what I could see of the dragons back, it was dark green on top, with red flecks. It had a pair of long forelegs, ending in sharp claws, and two shorter limbs about a quarter of the way from the end of its body.</p><p>Its head was more like an alligator's than a snake's, long and flat, with two yellow eyes protruding from its crown, large nostrils, and a flexible lower jaw which looked like it could open wide to consume large animals. Its face was a dark purple colour and its ears were surprisingly small, pointed and set close to its eyes. It had no teeth that I could see, but the gums of its jaws looked hard and sharp. It had a long, forked tongue which flicked lazily between its lips as it hung in the air and gazed upon us.</p><p>The dragon observed us for a few more seconds, wings beating steadily, claws flexing, pupils opening and dilating. Then, tucking in its wings, it dived sharply, forelegs stretched, talons exposed, mouth closed - aiming for the raft!</p><p>With startled yells, Harkat and I snapped to attention and threw ourselves flat. The dragon screamed by overhead. One of its claws connected with my left shoulder and sent me crashing into Harkat.</p><p>As we pushed ourselves apart, I sat up, rubbing my bruised shoulder, and saw the dragon turn smoothly in the air, reverse and begin another dive. This time, instead of throwing himself on to the raft, Harkat grabbed his oar and thrust it up at the dragon, roaring a challenge at the monster. The dragon screeched angrily in reply - a high-pitched sound - and swerved away.</p><p>\"Get up!\" Harkat yelled at me. As I struggled to my feet, he thrust my oar into my hands, got to his knees and rowed desperately. \"You keep it off - if you can,\" he gasped. \"I'll try and get us - to shore. Our only hope is to - make land and hope we can - hide.\"</p><p>Holding the oar up was agony, but I ignored the pain in my shoulder and kept the piece of wood aloft, pointed at the dragon like a spear, silently willing Harkat to row even quicker. Above, the dragon circled, yellow eyes focused on the raft, occasionally screeching.</p><p>\"It's assessing us,\" I muttered.</p><p>\"What?\" Harkat grunted.</p><p>\"It's making a study. Noting our speed, analyzing our strengths, calculating our weaknesses.\" I lowered my oar. \"Stop rowing.\"</p><p>\"Are you crazy?\" Harkat shouted.</p><p>\"We'll never make it,\" I said calmly. \"We're too far out. We'd best save our strength for fighting.\"</p><p>\"How the hell do you think - we're going to fight a dragon?\" Harkat snorted.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" I sighed. \"But we can't out-pace it, so we might as well be fresh when it attacks.\"</p><p>Harkat stopped rowing and stood beside me, staring at the dragon with his unblinking green eyes. \"Maybe it won't attack,\" he said with hollow optimism.</p><p>\"It's a predator,\" I replied, \"like the panther and alligators. It's not a question ofif it will attack, butwhen .\"</p><p>Harkat looked from the dragon to the shore and licked his lips. \"What if we swam? We wouldn't be as visible - in the water. That might make it harder - for it to grab us.\"</p><p>\"True,\" I agreed, \"but we wouldn't be able to defend ourselves. We won't jump unless we have to. In the meantime, let's sharpen our oars.\" Drawing one of my knives, I whittled away at the end of my oar. Harkat did the same with his. Within seconds of us setting to work on the oars, the dragon - perhaps sensing our intent - attacked, cutting short our preparations.</p><p>My immediate instinct was to duck, but I stood firm beside Harkat and we both raised our oars defensively. The dragon didn't pull out of its dive this time, but swooped even lower than before and barrelled into us with its hard head and shoulders, wings tucked in tight. We jabbed at it with our oars, but they snapped off its hard scales without causing the slightest bit of damage.</p><p>The dragon collided with the raft. The force of the blow sent us flying clear of the raft, deep under water. I came up gasping and thrashing wildly. Harkat was several metres adrift of me, also winded and bruised from the encounter. \"Got to - make the - raft!\" he shouted.</p><p>\"No use!\" I cried, pointing at the wreckage of the raft, which had been shattered to splinters. The dragon was hovering overhead, almost perpendicular to the sea, tail curled up into its scaly body. I swam to where Harkat was bobbing up and down, and we gazed up fearfully at the flying lizard.</p><p>\"What's it waiting for?\" Harkat wheezed. \"We're at its mercy. Why isn't it finishing - us off?\"</p><p>\"It seems to be puffing itself up,\" I noted, as the dragon closed its mouth and breathed in through its widening nostrils. \"It's almost as though it's getting ready to ?\" I stopped, my face whitening. \"Charna's guts!\"</p><p>\"What?\" Harkat snapped.</p><p>\"Have you forgotten what dragons are famous for?\"</p><p>Harkat stared at me, clueless, then clicked to it. \"They breathe fire!\"</p><p>Our eyes locked on the dragon's chest, which was expanding steadily. \"Watch it closely,\" I said, grabbing hold of Harkat's robes. \"When I say 'dive', power for the bottom of the lake as hard as you can, and stay under till your breath runs out.\"</p><p>\"It'll still be here - when we come up,\" Harkat said dejectedly.</p><p>\"Probably,\" I agreed, \"but if we're lucky, it only has one burst of fire in it.\"</p><p>\"What are you basing that - judgement on?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"Nothing.\" I grinned shakily. \"I'm just hoping.\"</p><p>There was no time for further exchanges. Above us, the dragon's tail curled down and back, and its head swung towards us. I waited until what I deemed the last possible instant, then, \"Dive!\" I screamed, and together Harkat and I rolled over and dived down deep, thrusting hard with our hands and feet.</p><p>As we descended, the water around us lit up redly. It then grew warm and began to bubble. Kicking even harder, we swam clear of the danger zone, down into the darkness of the deeper water. Once safe, we stopped and looked up. The lake had darkened again and we couldn't see the dragon. Clinging tight to each other, we held our mouths shut, waiting for as long as our breath would hold.</p><p>As we floated in silence and fear, there was a huge splash and the dragon came slicing through the water towards us. There was no time to evade it. Before we knew what was happening, the dragon hooked us with its claws, dragged us deeper down into the lake, then turned and struck for the surface.</p><p>Bursting free of the water, the dragon screeched triumphantly and rose into the air, Harkat trapped in one of its claws, me in the other. It had hold of my left arm, gripping me tightly, and I couldn't wriggle free.</p><p>\"Darren!\" Harkat screamed as we rose higher into the sky and surged towards shore. \"Can you - get loose?\"</p><p>\"No!\" I shouted. \"You?\"</p><p>\"I think so! It only has hold - of my robes.\"</p><p>\"Then free yourself!\" I yelled.</p><p>\"But what about?\"</p><p>\"Never mind me! Get free while you can!\"</p><p>Harkat cursed bitterly, then grabbed hold of the back of his robes where the dragon had caught him, and tugged sharply. I didn't hear the ripping over the sound of the dragon's wings, but suddenly Harkat was free and falling, landing with an almighty splash in the lake beneath.</p>","<p>The dragon hissed with frustration and circled around, obviously meaning to go after Harkat again. We were almost over land now, at the very edge of the lake. \"Stop!\" I roared helplessly at the dragon. \"Leave him alone!\" To my astonishment, the dragon paused when I shouted, and gazed at me with a strange expression in its giant yellow eyes. \"Leave him,\" I muttered desperately. Then, giving way to blind panic, I screamed at the beast, \"Let me go, you son of a?\"</p><p>Before I could complete the curse, the dragons claws unexpectedly retracted, and suddenly I was dropping through the sky like a stone. I had just enough time to worry about whether I was over the lake or over land. Then I hit hard ?earth or water - ? and the world went black.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>WHEN MYeyes opened, I was lying in a hammock. I thought I was back in the Cirque Du Freak. I looked over to tell Harkat about a weird dream I'd had - full of black panthers, giant toads and dragons - but when I did, I saw that I was in a poorly built shack. There was a strange man standing close by, studying me with beady eyes and stroking a long curved knife.</p><p>\"Who are you?\" I shouted, falling out of the hammock. \"Where am I?\"</p><p>\"Easy,\" the man chuckled, laying his knife aside. \"Sorry t' trouble ye, young 'un. I was watching over ye while ye slept. We get an awful lot o' crabs and scorpions here. I didn't want 'em getting stuck into ye while ye was recovering. Harkat!\" he bellowed. \"Yer wee friend's awake!\"</p><p>The door to the shack swung open and Harkat stepped in. The three scars from his fight with the panther were as prominent as usual, but he didn't look any the worse for wear otherwise. \"Afternoon, Sleeping Beauty,\" he grinned. \"You've been out for - almost two days.\"</p><p>\"Where are we?\" I asked, standing shakily. \"And who's this?\"</p><p>\"Spits Abrams,\" the stranger introduced himself, stepping forward into the beam of sunlight shining through a large hole in the roof. He was a broad, bearded man of medium height, with small eyes and bushy eyebrows. His black hair was long and curly, tied back with coloured pieces of string. He wore a faded brown jacket and trousers, a dirty white vest, and knee-high black boots. He was smiling and I could see that he was missing several teeth, while the others were discoloured and jagged. \"Spits Abrams,\" he said again, sticking out a hand. \"Pleased t' meet ye.\"</p><p>I took the man's hand - he had a strong grip - and shook it warily, wondering who he was and how I'd wound up here.</p><p>\"Spits rescued you from the lake,\" Harkat said. \"He saw the dragon attack - and drop you. He dragged you out and was - waiting for you to dry whenI waded out. He got a shock when - he saw me, but I convinced him I was harmless. We carried you here, to his - home. We've been waiting for you - to wake.\"</p><p>\"Many thanks, Mr Abrams,\" I said.</p><p>\"Tain't nowt t' be thanking me fer,\" he laughed. \"I jest fished ye out, same as any other fisherman would've.\"</p><p>\"You're a fisherman?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Of a sort,\" he beamed. \"I used t' be a pirate 'fore I ended up here, and 'twas people I fished fer. But since there ain't much grows round these parts, I've been eating mostly fish since I came - and fishing fer em.\"</p><p>\"A pirate?\" I blinked. \"A real one?\"</p><p>\"Aaarrr, Darren lad,\" he growled, then winked.</p><p>\"Let's go outside,\" Harkat said, seeing my confusion. \"There's food on the fire and - your clothes are dry and repaired.\"</p><p>I realized I was only wearing my underpants, so I hurried out after Harkat, found my clothes hanging on a tree, and slipped them on. We were close to the edge of the lake, on a meagre green patch amidst a long stretch of rocky soil. The shack was built in the shelter of two small trees. There was a tiny garden out back.</p><p>\"That's where I grows me potatoes,\" Spits said. \"Not fer eating - though I has one 'r two when I takes a fancy - but fer brewing poteen. My grandfather came from Connemara - in Ireland - and he used t' make a living from it. He taught me all his secrets. I never bothered before I washed up here - I prefer whisky - but since spuds is all I can grow, I has t' make do.\"</p><p>Dressed, I sat by the fire and Spits offered me one of the fish speared on sticks over the flames. Biting into the fish, I ate ravenously, silently studying Spits Abrams, not sure what to make of him.</p><p>\"Want some poteen to wash that down with?\" Spits asked.</p><p>\"I wouldn't,\" Harkat advised me. \"I tried it and it made - my eyes water.\"</p><p>\"I'll give it a miss then,\" I said. Harkat had a high tolerance for alcohol, and could drink just about anything. If the poteen had made his eyes water, it'd probably blow my head clean off my neck.</p><p>\"Yerra, go on,\" Spits encouraged me, passing over a jug filled with a clear liquid. \"It might blind ye, but Won't kill ye. 'Twill put hairs on yer chest!\"</p><p>\"I'm hairy enough,\" I chuckled, then leant forward, nudging the jug of poteen aside. \"I don't want to be rude, Spits, but who are you and how did you get here?\"</p><p>Spits laughed at the question. \"That's what this 'un asked too, the first time he saw me,\" he said, pointing at Harkat with his thumb. \"I've told him all about myself these last couple o' days - did a helluva lot o' talking fer a man who ain't said a word fer five or six years! I won't go through the whole thing again, just give ye the quick lowdown.\"</p><p>Spits had been a pirate in the Far East in the 1930s. Although piracy was a \"dying art\" (as he put it), there were still ships which sailed the seas and attacked others in the years before World War II, plundering them of their spoils. Spits found himself working on one of the pirate ships after years of ordinary naval service (he said he was shanghaied, though his eyes shifted cagily, and I got the feeling he wasn't being honest). \"ThePrince o' Pariahs was 'er name.\" He beamed proudly. \"A fine ship, small but speedy. We was the scourge o' the waters wherever we went.\"</p><p>It was Spits's job to fish people out of the sea if they jumped in when they were boarded. \"Two reasons we didn't like leaving 'em there,\" he said. \"One was that we didn't want 'em to drown - we was pirates, not killers. The other was that the ones who jumped was normally carrying jewels or other such valuables - only the rich is that scared of being robbed!\"</p><p>Spits got that shifty look in his eyes again when he was talking about fishing people out, but I said nothing about it, not wanting to offend the man who'd rescued me from the lake.</p><p>One night, thePrince of Pariahs found itself at the centre of a fierce storm. Spits said it was the worst he'd ever experienced, \"and I been through just about everything that old sow of a sea can throw at a man!\" As the ship broke apart, Spits grabbed a sturdy plank, some jugs of whisky and the nets he used to fish for people, and jumped overboard.</p><p>\"Next thing I know, I'm in this lake,\" he finished. \"I dragged myself out and there was a small man in big yellow galoshes waiting fer me.\"Mr Tiny! \"He told me I'd come to a place far from the one I knew, and I was stuck. He said this was a land o' dragons, awful dangerous fer humans, but there was a shack where I'd be safe. If I stayed there and kept a watch on the lake, two people would come along eventually, and they could make my dreams come true. So I sat back, fished, found spuds growing nearby and brought some back fer me garden, and I been waiting ever since, five 'r six years near as I can figure.\"</p><p>I thought that over, staring from Spits to Harkat and back again. \"What did he mean when he said we'd be able to make your dreams come true?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I suppose he meant ye'd be able t' get me home.\" Spits's eyes shifted nervously. \"That's the only dream this old sailor has, t' get back where there's women and whisky, and not a drop o' water bigger than a puddle in sight - I've had enough o' seas and lakes!\"</p><p>I wasn't sure I believed that was all the pirate had on his mind, but I let the matter drop and instead asked if he knew anything about the land ahead. \"Not a whole lot,\" he answered. \"I've done some exploring, but the dragons keep me pinned here most o' the time - I don't like wandering off too far with them demons waiting to pounce.\"</p><p>\"There's more than one?\" I frowned.</p><p>\"Aaarrr,\" he said. \"I ain't sure how many, but definitely four 'r five. The one that went after ye is the biggest I've seen, though mebbe there's bigger that don't bother with this lake.\"</p><p>\"I don't like the sound of that,\" I muttered.</p><p>\"Me neither,\" Harkat said. Then, turning to Spits, he said, \"Show him the net.\"</p><p>Spits ducked behind the shack and emerged dragging a stringy old net, which he untangled and spread on the ground. \"Two o' me nets slipped through with me,\" he said. \"I lost t' other one a couple o' years back when a huge fish snatched it out o' my hands. I been keeping this 'un safe, in case of an emergency.\"</p><p>I remembered what Evanna had told us, that we'd need a net which had been used to fish for the dead if we were to find out who Harkat had been. \"Think this is the net we need?\" I asked Harkat.</p><p>\"Must be,\" he answered. \"Spits says he didn't use his nets to - fish for the dead, but this has to be it.\"</p><p>\"Course I never fished fer the dead!\" Spits boomed, laughing weakly. \"What'd I do that fer? Mind, I been thinking about it since Harkat asked, and I recall a couple o' people who drowned when I was fishing 'em out. So I guess it probablyhas been used to drag up corpses - accidentally, like.\"</p><p>Spits's eyes practically shot out of his sockets, they were darting so swiftly from side to side. There was definitely something the ex-pirate wasn't telling us. But I couldn't pump him for information without indicating that I didn't believe him, and this was no time to risk making an enemy.</p><p>After eating, we discussed what to do next. Spits didn't know anything about a Temple of the Grotesque. Nor had he seen any people during his long, lonely years here. He'd told Harkat that the dragons usually approached the lake from the southeast. The Little Person was of the opinion that we should go in that direction, though he couldn't say why - just a gut feeling. Since I'd no personal preference, I bowed to his wishes and we agreed to head southeast that night, moving under cover of darkness.</p><p>\"Ye'll take me along, won't ye?\" Spits asked eagerly. \"I'd feel awful if ye went without me.\"</p><p>\"We don't know what we're - walking into,\" Harkat warned the grizzly ex-pirate. \"You could be risking your life - by coming with us.\"</p><p>\"Nowt t' worry about!\" Spits guffawed. \"'Twon't be the first time I risked it. I remember when thePrince o' Pariahs sailed into a trap off the Chinese coast ?\"</p><p>Once Spits got talking about his adventures on the pirate ship, there was no stopping him. He regaled us with wild, bawdy tales of the plundering they'd done and battles they'd engaged in. As he spoke, he sipped from his jug of poteen, and as the day wore on his voice got louder and his tales got wilder - he told some extra spicy stories about what he'd got up to during shore leave! Eventually, with the sun starting to set, he dozed off and curled up into a ball beside the fire, clutching his almost empty jug of poteen close to his chest.</p><p>\"He's some character,\" I whispered, and Harkat chuckled softly.</p><p>\"I feel sorry for him,\" Harkat said. \"To be stuck here alone for - so long must have been dreadful.\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I agreed, but not wholeheartedly. \"But there's something 'off' about him, isn't there? He makes me feel uneasy, the way his eyes flick left and right so beadily when he's lying.\"</p><p>\"I noticed that too,\" Harkat nodded. \"He tells all sorts of lies - last night he - said he'd been engaged to a Japanese princess - but it's - only when he talks about his job on the ?Prince of Pariahs that he gets thereally shifty look.\"</p><p>\"What do you think he's hiding?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I've no idea,\" Harkat replied. \"I doubt it matters - there are - no pirate ships here.\"</p><p>\"At least none that we've seen,\" I grinned.</p><p>Harkat studied the sleeping Spits - he was drooling into his unkempt beard - then said quietly, \"We can leave him behind - if you'd prefer. He'll be asleep for hours. If we leave now and walk - fast, he'll never find us.\"</p><p>\"Do you think he's dangerous?\" I asked.</p><p>Harkat shrugged. \"He might be. But there must be a reason why - Mr Tiny put him here. I think we should take him. And his net.\"</p><p>\"Definitely the net,\" I agreed. Clearing my throat, I added, \"There's his blood too. I need human blood - and soon.\"</p><p>\"I thought of that,\" Harkat said. \"It's why I didn't stop him - drinking. Do you want to take some now?\"</p><p>\"Maybe I should wait for him to wake and ask him,\" I suggested.</p><p>Harkat shook his head. \"Spits is superstitious. He thinks I'm a demon.\"</p><p>\"A demon!\" I laughed.</p><p>\"I told him what I really - was, but he wouldn't listen. In the end I settled for persuading him - that I was a harmless demon - an imp. I sounded him out about vampires. He believes in them, but thinks they're - evil monsters. Said he'd drive a stake through - the heart of the first one he met. I think you should drink - from him while he's asleep, and never - tell him what you really are.\"</p><p>I didn't like doing it - I'd no qualms about drinking secretly from strangers, but on the rare occasions when I'd had to drink from people I knew, I'd always asked their permission - but I bowed to Harkat's greater knowledge of Spits Abrams's ways.</p>","<p>Sneaking up on the sleeping sot, I bared his lower left leg, made a small cut with my right index nail, clamped my mouth around it and sucked. His blood was thin and riddled with alcohol - he must have drunk huge amounts of poteen and whisky over the years! - but I forced it down. When I'd drunk enough, I released him and waited for the blood around the cut to dry. When it had, I cleaned it and rolled the leg of his trousers down.</p><p>\"Better?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"Yes.\" I burped. \"I wouldn't like to drink from him often - there's more poteen than blood in his veins! - but it'll restore my strength and keep me going for the next few weeks.\"</p><p>\"Spits won't wake until morning,\" Harkat noted. \"We'll have to wait - until tomorrow night to start, unless you - want to risk travelling by day.\"</p><p>\"With dragons roaming overhead? No thanks! Anyway, an extra day of rest won't hurt - I'm still recovering from our last run-in.\"</p><p>\"By the way, how did you - get it to drop you?\" Harkat asked as we settled down for the night. \"And why did it - fly away and leave us?\"</p><p>I thought back, recalled yelling at the dragon to let me go, and told Harkat what had happened. He stared at me disbelievingly, so Iwinked and said, \"I always did have a way with dumb animals!\" And I left it at that, even though I was equally bewildered by the dragon's strange retreat.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>ITHOUGHTSpits would have a sore head when he awoke, but he was in fine form - he said he never suffered from hangovers. He spent the day tidying up the shack, putting everything in order in case he ever returned. He stashed a jug of poteen away in a corner and packed the rest in a large sack he planned to carry slung over his shoulder, along with spare clothes, his fishing net, some potatoes and dried fish slices. Harkat and I had almost nothing to carry - apart from the panthers teeth and gelatinous globes, most of which we'd managed to hang on to - so we offered to divide Spits's load between us, but he wouldn't hear of it. \"Every man to a cross of his own,\" he muttered.</p><p>We took it easy during the day. I hacked my hair back from my eyes with one of Spits's rusty blades. We'd replaced our handmade knives, most of which we'd lost in the lake, with real knives that Spits had lying around.</p><p>Harkat stitched together holes in his robes with bits of old string.</p><p>When night fell, we set off, heading due southeast towards a mountain range in the distance. Spits was surprisingly morose to be leaving his shack - \"'Tis the closest thing to a home I've had since running away t' sea when I was twelve,\" he sighed - but several swigs of poteen improved his mood and by midnight he was singing and joking.</p><p>I was worried that Spits would collapse - his legs were wobbling worse than the jelly-like globes we were carting - but as drunk as he got, his pace never wavered, though he did stop quite often to \"bail out the bilge water\". When we made camp beneath a bushy tree in the morning, he fell straight asleep and snored loudly all day long. He woke shortly before sunset, licked his lips and reached for the poteen.</p><p>The weather worsened over the next few nights, as we left the lowlands and scaled the mountains. It rained almost constantly, harder than before, soaking our clothes and leaving us wet, cold and miserable - except Spits, whose poteen warmed and cheered him up whatever the conditions. I decided to try some of Spits's home-brewed concoction, to see if it would combat the gloom. One swallow later, I was rolling on the ground, gasping for breath, eyes bulging. Spits laughed while Harkat poured water down my throat, then urged me to try it again. \"The first dram's the worst,\" he chuckled. Through wheezing coughs, I firmly declined.</p><p>It was difficult to know what to make of Spits Abrams. A lot of the time he came across as a funny old sailor, crude and coarse, but with a soft centre. But as I spent more time with him, I thought that a lot of his speech patterns seemed deliberately theatrical - he spoke with a broad accent on purpose, to give the impression he was scatterbrained. And there were times when his mood darkened and he'd mutter ominously about people who'd betrayed him in one way or another.</p><p>\"They thought they was so high and mighty!\" he growled one night, weaving drunkenly under the cloudy sky. \"Better than dumb old Spits. Said I was a monster, not fit t' share a ship with 'em. But I'll show 'em! When I gets me hands on 'em, I'll make 'em suffer!\"</p><p>He never said how he intended to \"get his hands on\" whoever \"em\" were. We hadn't told Spits what year we'd come from, but he knew time had moved on - he often made reference to \"yer generation\" or said \"things was different in my day\". I couldn't see any way back for Spits, and he couldn't either - a common refrain of his when he was feeling sorry for himself was, \"Here I is and here I'll die.\" Yet still he swore to get his own back on \"them what done me wrong\", despite the fact that the people he disliked would have been dead and buried decades ago.</p><p>Another night, while he was telling us about his tasks on board thePrince of Pariahs , he stopped and looked at us with a steady blank expression. \"I had t' kill every now and then,\" he said softly. \"Pirates is vagabonds. Even though we didn't kill those we robbed, we sometimes had t'. If people refused t' surrender, we had t' put a stop to 'em. Couldn't afford t' let 'em off the hook.\"</p><p>\"But I thought you didn't board the ships you attacked,\" I said. \"You told us you fished out people who jumped overboard.\"</p><p>\"Aaarrr,\" he grinned bleakly, \"but a man in the water can struggle just as much as one on deck. A woman too. Sometimes I had t' teach 'em a lesson.\" His eyes cleared a little and he grinned sheepishly. \"But that was rare. I only mention it so ye know ye can rely on me if we gets into a tight spot. I ain't a killer, but I'll do it if me back's against a wall, or t' save a friend.\"</p><p>Harkat and I didn't doze much that day. Instead we kept a wary watch on the snoring Spits. Although we were stronger and fitter than him, he posed a worrying threat. What if he got into a drunken fit and took it into his head to kill us in our sleep?</p><p>We discussed the possibility of leaving the ex-pirate behind, but it didn't seem fair to strand him in the mountains. Although he was able to keep pace beside us during our marches, he had no sense of direction and would have become lost in no time if he'd been by himself. Besides, we might have need of his fishing skills if we made it to the Lake of Souls. Both of us could catch fish with our hands, but neither of us knew much about angling.</p><p>In the end we chose to keep Spits with us, but agreed not to turn our backs on him, to take turns sleeping, and to cut him loose if he ever threatened violence.</p><p>We made slow but steady progress through the mountains. If the weather had been finer, we'd have raced through, but all the rain had led to mudslides and slippery underfoot conditions. We had to walk carefully, and were often forced to backtrack and skirt around an area made inaccessible by the rain and mud.</p><p>\"Does it normally rain this much?\" I asked Spits.</p><p>\"T' tell the truth, this has been one o' the better years,\" he chortled. \"We gets very hot summers - long, too - but the winters are dogs. Mind, it'll probably break in another night or two - we ain't hit the worst o' the season yet, and it's rare t' get more'n a week or so o' nonstop rain at this time o' year.\"</p><p>As though the clouds had been listening, they eased up the next morning - affording us a welcome view of blue sky - and by night, when we set off, it was the driest it had been since we landed at Spits's shack.</p><p>That same night, we topped a small peak and found ourselves on a sharp decline into a long, wide chasm leading out of the mountain ridges. The base of the chasm was flooded with rainwater, but there were ledges along the sides which we'd be able to use. Hurrying down the mountain, we located one of the broader ledges, tied a rope around ourselves to form a chain, me in front, Spits in the middle, Harkat behind, and set off over the fast-flowing river, edging forwards at a snail's pace. Spits even went so far as to cork his jug of poteen and leave it untouched!</p><p>Day dawned while we were on the ledge. We hadn't seen any caves in the cliff, but there were plenty of large holes and cracks. Untying ourselves, each of us crawled into a hole to rest, out of sight of any passing dragons. It was extremely uncomfortable, but I was exhausted after the hard climb and fell asleep immediately, not waking until late in the day.</p><p>After a quick meal - the last of Spits's dried fish slices - we tied ourselves together again andset off. It beganto drizzle shortly afterwards, but then it cleared for the rest of the night and we progressed without interruption. The ledge didn't run all the way to the end of the chasm, but there were ledges above and beneath it which we were able to transfer to, making the journey in stages. Shortly before daybreak we came to the end of the chasm and crawled down to a flat plain which spread out for many kilometres ahead of us, ending in a massive forest which stretched left and right as far as we could see.</p><p>We debated our options. Since none of us wanted to sleep in a hole in the cliff again, and the route to the forest was littered with bushes we could hide under if we spotted a dragon, we decided to head for the trees straightaway. Forcing our tired legs on, we jogged briskly over the plain, Spits feeding himself with poteen, somehow managing not to spill a drop despite the jolting of his arms as he ran.</p><p>We made camp just within the edge of the forest. While Harkat kept an eye on Spits, I slept soundly until early afternoon. Harkat and I caught a wild pig soon after that, which Spits gleefully roasted over a quickly constructed fire. We tucked into our first hot meal since leaving for the mountains more than two weeks earlier - delicious! Wiping our hands clean on the grass afterwards, we set off in a general southeast direction - it was hard to tell precisely with all the tree cover - prepared for a long, gloomy trek through the forest.</p><p>To our surprise, we cleared the trees a few hours before sunset - the forest was long, but narrow. We found ourselves standing at the top of a small cliff, gazing down on fields of the tallest, greenest grass I'd ever seen. No trees grew in the fields, and though there must have been many streams feeding the soil to produce such greenery, they were hidden by the towering stalks of grass.</p><p>Only one object stood out against the otherwise unbroken sea of green - a huge white building a couple of kilometres directly ahead, which shone like a beacon under the evening sun. Harkat and I shared a glance and said simultaneously, with a mixture of excitement and tension, \"The Temple of the Grotesque!\"</p><p>Spits stared suspiciously at the building, spat over the edge of the cliff, and snorted. \"Trouble!\"</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>THE STALKSof grass grew thickly together, a couple of metres high. We had to chop our way through, like hacking a path through a jungle. It was hard, slow work, and night had fallen before we reached the temple. Studying it by the light of a strong moon, we were impressed by its stature. Made of large rough stones which had been painted white, it stood thirty-five or forty metres high. A square building, its walls were about a hundred metres in length, and supported a flat roof. We did a full circuit of the exterior and there was only one entrance, a huge open doorway, five metres wide by eight or nine high. We could see the flicker of candlelight from within.</p><p>\"I don't like the look o' this place,\" Spits muttered.</p><p>\"Me neither,\" I sighed. \"But if it's the Temple of the Grotesque, we have to go in and find the holy liquid that Evanna told us about.\"</p><p>\"Ye two can trust a witch's word if ye like,\" Spits grunted, \"but I ain't having nowt t' do with dark forces! If ye want t' enter, best o' luck. I'll wait out here.\"</p><p>\"Afraid?\" Harkat grinned.</p><p>\"Aaarrr,\" Spits replied. \"Ye should be too. Ye can call this the Temple o' the Grotesque if ye like, but I knows what it really is - a Temple o' Death!\" And he stormed off to find a hiding place in a patch of nearby grass.</p><p>Harkat and I shared Spits's gloomy opinion, but we had to venture in. Knives drawn, we crept to the doorway and were about to enter, when the sound of chanting drifted to us over the clear night air. We paused uncertainly, then drew back to where Spits was hiding in the grass.</p><p>\"Changed yer minds?\" he hooted.</p><p>\"We heard something,\" Harkat told him. \"It sounded like voices ?human - voices. They were chanting.\"</p><p>\" Where'd they come from?\" Spits asked.</p><p>\"To our left,\" I told him.</p><p>\"Will I go check 'em out while ye explore yer temple?\"</p><p>\"I think it would be best if we all - went to check,\" Harkat said. \"If there are people here, this temple - must be theirs. We can ask them about it and - maybe they can help us.\"</p><p>\"Ye're awfully simple-minded fer a demon,\" Spits laughed cynically. \"Never trust a stranger, that's what I says!\"</p><p>That was good advice, and we paid heed to it, quietly sliding through the grass - which didn't grow so thickly here - cautiously closing in on the chanting. A short way beyond the temple, we came to the edge of a clearing. In it was a small, peculiar-looking village. The huts were made of grass and built very low to the ground, no more than a metre high. Either we'd come to a village of pygmies, or the huts were only used as shelters to sleep beneath. Rough grey robes were bundled in a pile in the centre of the village. Dead sheep-like animals were stacked one on top of another, close to the robes.</p><p>As we were taking in the sight of the village, a na**d man appeared through the grass to our right. He was of ordinary height and build, a light brown colour, but with lanky pink hair and dull white eyes. He walked to the mound of dead sheep, dragged one out and returned the way he'd come, pulling the sheep by its rear legs. Without discussing it, Spits, Harkat and I set off after him, keeping to the edge of the village, still hidden in the grass.</p>","<p>The chanting - which had died down - began again as we approached the spot where the man had disappeared into the grass. We found a path of many footprints in the soft earth and traced them to a second, smaller clearing. There was a pond at the centre, around which thirty-seven people stood, eight men, fifteen women and fourteen children. All were na**d, brown-skinned, pink-haired and white-eyed.</p><p>Two men hung the dead sheep over the pond, stretched lengthways by its legs, while another man took a knife of white bone or stone and sliced the animal's stomach open. Blood and guts plopped into the pond. As I strained my neck, I saw that the water was a dirty red colour. The men held the sheep over the pond until the blood stopped dripping, then slung the carcass to one side and stood back as three women stepped forward.</p><p>The women were old and wrinkled, with fierce expressions and bony fingers. Chanting louder than anyone else, they stooped, swirled the water of the pond around with their hands, then filled three leather flasks withit . Standing, they beckoned the other people forward. As they filed past the first woman, she raised her flask high and poured the red water over their heads. The second woman wet her fingers with the water and drew two rough circular diagrams on everybody's chest. The third pressed the mouth of her flask to their lips, and they drank the putrid water within.</p><p>After the three women had attended to all of the people, they moved in a line back to the village, eyes closed, chanting softly. We slipped off to one side, then trailed after them, frightened and perplexed, but incredibly curious.</p><p>In the village, the people pulled on the grey robes, each of which was cut away in front to reveal their chest and the round crimson signs. Only one person remained unclothed - a young boy, of about twelve or thirteen. When all were dressed, they formed a long line, three abreast, the trio of old women who'd handled the flasks at the fore and the na**d boy by himself in front of everybody else. Chanting loudly, they marched in a procession towards the temple. We waited until they'd passed, then followed silently, intrigued.</p><p>At the entrance to the temple, the procession stopped and the volume of the chanting increased. I couldn't understand what they were saying - their language was alien to me - but one word was repeated more than any other, and with great emphasis. \"Kulashka!\"</p><p>\"Any idea what 'Kulashka' means?\" I asked Harkat and Spits.</p><p>\"No,\" Harkat said.</p><p>Spits began to shake his head, then stopped, eyes widening, lips thinning with fear. \"Saints o' the sailors!\" he croaked, and fell to his knees.</p><p>Harkat and I gawped at Spits, then looked up and saw the cause of his shock. Our jaws dropped as we set eyes on the most nightmarishly monstrous creature imaginable, wriggling out of the temple like a mutant worm.</p><p>It must have been human once, or descended from humans. It had a human face, except its head was the size of six or seven normal heads. Andit had dozens of hands. No arms - and no legs or feet - just loads of hands sticking out of it like pin heads in a pincushion. It was a couple of metres wide and maybe ten or eleven metres long. Its body tapered back like a giant slug. It crept forward slowly on its hundreds of fingers, dragging itself along, though it looked capable of moving more quickly if it wished. It had just one enormous bloodshot eye, hanging low on the left side of its face. Several ears dotted its head in various places, and there were two huge, bulging noses set high above its upper lip. Its skin was a dirty white colour, hanging from its obscene frame in saggy, flabby folds, which quivered wildly every time it moved.</p><p>Evanna had named the monster well. It was utterly and totally grotesque. No other word could have conveyed its repulsive qualities as simply and clearly.</p><p>As I recovered from my initial shock, I focused on what was happening. The na**d boy was on his knees beneath the Grotesque, arms spread wide, roaring over and over, \"Kulashka! Kulashka! Kulashka!\"</p><p>As the boy roared and the people chanted, the Grotesque paused and raised its head. It did this like a snake, arching its body back so that the front section came up. From where we were hiding I got a closer look at its face. It was lumpy and ill formed, as though it had been carved from putty by a sculptor with a shaky hand. There were scraps of hair everywhere I looked, nasty dark tufts, more like skin growths than hair. I saw no teeth inside its gaping maw of a mouth, except for two long, curved fangs near the front.</p><p>The Grotesque lowered itself and slithered around the group of people. It left a thin, slimy trail of sweat. The sweat oozed from pores all over its body. I caught the salty scent, and although it wasn't as overpowering as that of the giant toad, it was enough to make me clamp my hand over my nose and mouth so that I didn't throw up. The people - the Kulashkas, for want of a better word - didn't mind the stench though. They knelt as their - god? king? pet? - whatever it was to them, passed and rubbed their faces in its trail of sweat. Some even stuck out their tongues and licked it up!</p><p>When the Grotesque had circled all of its worshippers, it returned to the boy at the front. Raising its head again, it leant forward and stuck out its tongue, a huge pink slab, dripping with thick globs of saliva. It licked the boy's face. He didn't flinch, but smiled proudly. The Grotesque licked him again, then wrapped its unnatural body around him once, twice, three times, and suffocated him with its fleshy coils, the way a boa constrictor kills its victims.</p><p>My first impulse was to rush to the boy's aid when I saw him disappearing beneath the sweaty flesh of the Grotesque, but I couldn't have saved him. Besides, I could see that he didn't wish to be saved. It was clear by his smile that he considered this an honour. So I stayed crouched low in the grass and kept out of it.</p><p>The Grotesque crushed the life out of the boy - he cried out once, briefly, as the creature made splinters of his bones - then unwrapped itself and set about swallowing him whole. Again, in this respect, it acted like a snake. It had a supple lower jaw which stretched down far enough for the monster to get its mouth around the boy's head and shoulders. By using its tongue, jaw and some of its hands, it slowly but steadily fed the rest of the boy's body down its eager throat.</p><p>As the Grotesque devoured the boy, two of the women entered the temple. They emerged shortly afterwards, clasping two glass vials, about forty centimetres long, with thick glass walls and cork stoppers. A dark liquid ran about three-quarters of the way to the top of each vial - it had to be Evanna's \"holy liquid\".</p><p>When the Grotesque had finished devouring the boy, a man stepped forward and took one of the vials. Stepping up to the beast, he held the vial aloft and chanted softly. The Grotesque studied him coldly. I thought it meant to kill him too, but then it lowered its head and opened its enormous mouth. The man reached into the Grotesque's mouth, removed the cork from the vial and raised it to one of the creature's fangs. Inserting the tip of the fang into the vial, he pressed the glass wall hard against it. A thick, viscous substance oozed out of the fang and trickled down the side of the tube. I'd seen Evra milking poison from his snake's fangs many times - this was exactly the same.</p><p>When no more liquid seeped from the fang, the man corked the vial, handed it back to the woman, took the second vial and milked the Grotesque's other fang. When he'd finished, he stepped away and the monster's mouth closed. The man passed the vial back, joined the rest of the group, and began chanting loudly along with everyone else. The Grotesque studied them with its single red eye, its inhumanly human-like head swaying from side to side in time with the chanting. Then it slowly turned and scuttled back into the temple on its carriage of fingers. As it entered, the people followed, in rows of three, chanting softly, vanishing into the gloom of the temple after the Grotesque, leaving us shaken and alone outside, to withdraw and discuss the sinister spectacle.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>\"YE'RE CRAZY!\" Spits hissed, keeping his voice down so as not to attract the attention of the Kulashkas. \"Ye want t' go into that devil's lair and risk yer lives, fer the sake o' some bottles o' poison?\"</p><p>\"There must be something - special about it,\" Harkat insisted. \"We wouldn't have been told we - needed it if it wasn't important.\"</p><p>\"Nowt's worth throwing yer lives away fer,\" Spits snarled. \"That monster will have ye both fer pudding, and still be hungry after.\"</p><p>\"I'm not sure about that,\" I muttered. \"It fed like a snake. I know about snakes from when I shared a tent with Evra - a snake-boy,\" I added for Spits's benefit. \"A child would take a long time to digest, even for a beast of that size. I doubt it'll need to eat again for a few days. And a snake normally sleeps while it's digesting.\"</p><p>\"But this ain't a snake,\" Spits reminded me. \"It's a - what did ye call it?\"</p><p>\"Grotesque,\" Harkat said.</p><p>\"Aaarrr. Ye never shared a tent with a Grotesque, did ye? So ye know nothing about 'em. Ye'd be mad t' risk it. And what about that crazy pink-haired mob? If they catch ye, they won't be long offering ye up t' that giant mongrel o' theirs.\"</p><p>\"What do you think the deal - is with them?\" Harkat asked. \"I believe they worship the Grotesque. That's why they - sacrificed the boy.\"</p><p>\"A fine how-d'ye-do.'\" Spits huffed. \"'Tis one thing t' go killing a stranger, but t' willingly give up one o' yer own - madness!\"</p><p>\"They can't do it often,\" I noted. \"There aren't many of them. They'd die out if they made a human sacrifice every time the beast was hungry. They must feed it with sheep and other animals, and only offer up a human on special occasions.\"</p><p>\"Should we try - talking to them?\" Harkat asked. \"Many civilized people in the past - offered human sacrifices to their gods. They might not be violent.\"</p><p>\"I've no intention of putting them to the test,\" I said quickly. \"We can't walk away from this - we saw them milk the snake's fangs, and I'm pretty certain that poison is the holy liquid we need. But let's not push our luck. There's no telling what the people of this world are like. The Kulashkas might be lovely folk who welcome strangers with open arms - or they might feed us to the Grotesque the instant they set eyes on us.\"</p><p>\"We're stronger than them,\" Harkat said. \"We could fight them off.\"</p><p>\"We don't know that,\" I disagreed. \"We've no idea what these people are capable of. They could be ten times as strong as you or me. I say we hit the temple, grab the vials, and beat it quick.\"</p><p>\"Forget the vials!\" Spits pleaded. He'd been drinking heavily from his jug since we'd retreated to safety and was trembling worse than normal. \"We can come back later if we need 'em.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Harkat said. \"Darren's right about the Kulashkas. But if we're going to launch a - quick raid, we need to do it while the Grotesque is sleeping. We have to go after the - holy liquid now. You don't have to come - if you don't want.\"</p><p>\"I won't!\" Spits said quickly. \"I ain't gonna chuckmy life away on a crazy thing like this. I'll wait out here. If ye don't return, I'll carry on ahead and look fer yer Lake o' Souls myself. If it holds the dead like ye say, I might meet ye there!\" He chuckled wickedly at that.</p><p>\"Will we go while it's dark,\" I asked Harkat, \"or wait for morning?\"</p><p>\"Wait,\" Harkat said. \"The Kulashkas might have sung themselves - to sleep by then.\" The pink-haired people had returned to their village an hour after making their sacrifice, and had been singing, dancing and chanting ever since.</p><p>We lay back and rested as the moon crossed the cloudless sky (typical - when we wanted clouds for cover, there weren't any!), listening to the music of the strange Kulashkas. Spits kept sipping from his jug of poteen, his beady eyes getting smaller and smaller, tugging at the strands of his tied-back hair, muttering darkly about block-headed fools and their just comeuppances.</p><p>The noise from the Kulashka village died away towards morning, and by dawn there was silence. Harkat and I shared a questioning glance, nodded and stood. \"We're going,\" I told Spits, who was half dozing over his jug.</p><p>\"Wha'?\" he grunted, head snapping up.</p><p>\"We're going,\" I said again. \"Wait here. If we're not back by night, go your own way and don't worry about us.\"</p><p>\"I won't wait that long,\" he sniffed. \"I'll be gone by midday, with 'r without ye.\"</p><p>\"Suit yourself,\" I sighed, \"but you'd be less visible in the dark. It would be safer.\"</p><p>Spits's features softened. \"Ye're mad,\" he said, \"but ye've more guts than any pirate I ever sailed with. I'll wait till sunset and keep the poteen ready - ye might be glad of it if ye survive.\"</p><p>\"We might at that,\" I grinned, then spun away with Harkat and pushed through the tall covering grass to the doorway of the Temple of the Grotesque.</p><p>We stopped at the door of the temple, gripping our knives close by our sides, inhaling the foul sweaty stench of the beast. \"What if there are guards?\" I whispered.</p><p>\"Knock them out,\" Harkat said. \"Kill them only if we - must. But I doubt there'll be any - they would have - come out with the Grotesque if there were.\"</p><p>Taking deep, nervous breaths, we slid inside the temple, back to back, moving slowly and warily. Candles jutted from the walls, not a huge number, but enough to light our way. We were in a short, narrow corridor, covered by a low roof. A large room lay ahead. We paused at the entrance. The room was enormous. The roof was supported by giant pillars, but there were no other dividing structures. In the centre of the temple, the Grotesque was curled around a raised circular platform, upon which we saw a tall, hollow, upright crystal cylinder packed with vials like the ones the Kulashkas had used to milk the monsters venom.</p>","<p>\"No lack of holy liquid,\" I whispered to Harkat.</p><p>\"The trouble will be - getting to it,\" he replied. \"I think the Grotesque's body goes - all the way around the altar.\"</p><p>I hadn't thought of the platform as an altar, but now that I looked again, I saw that Harkat was right - the cylinder holding the vials had the appearance of some religious relic.</p><p>We started across the room to the altar, the only sound our shallow breathing. The Grotesque's head was buried underneath its fleshy rear, so it shouldn't have a view of us if it was awake - though I hoped with all my being that it wasn't! There was a path leading directly from the doorway to the altar, lit by tall candles, but we approached the altar from the side, where we'd be less conspicuous.</p><p>We soon ran into an unexpected obstacle. The floorboards at the sides of the path were rotten and creaked heavily as we crossed them. \"The path must be the only one reinforced from below,\" I hissed as we stopped to ponder our options. \"By the echoes of the creaks, there's a pit beneath the boards.\"</p><p>\"Should we return to - the path?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>I shook my head. \"Let's continue - but tread carefully!\" Despite our attempts to proceed with care, a few metres further on, Harkat's left foot snapped through a board and his leg shot down into darkness. He gasped painfully but bit down on a cry. My eyes snapped to where the Grotesque was coiled, to see if it had stirred, but it was in the same position as before. The fingers close to its head twitched a few times - I hoped that meant it was asleep and dreaming. Stooping, I examined the board around Harkat's leg, carefully snapped more of it away to increase the width of the hole, then helped ease him out of it and back on to slightly sturdier boards.</p><p>\"Are you hurt?\" I asked softly.</p><p>\"Cut,\" Harkat answered, probing his leg. \"Not bad.\"</p><p>\"We can't chance these boards any longer,\" I said. \"We'll have to use the path.\"</p><p>Together we hobbled back to the path, where we rested a minute, before advancing to the altar. By the luck of the vampires the Grotesque slept on. Once there, we walked around the putrid monster, looking for a gap where we could mount the altar. But the Grotesque had fully encircled it, chunks of its flesh draped off it in places. This close to the beast, I couldn't help but stare and marvel that such a thing could have come to exist. What troubled me most was its obviously human features. It was like a nightmare come to life - but a human nightmare. What was its history? How had it been born?</p><p>Having walked around the Grotesque a couple of times, I tore my gaze away. Not daring to talk this close to the creature, I tucked my knife away and made hand signals at Harkat, indicating that we'd have to jump over the monster at its narrowest point, close to where its tail lapped over its head. Harkat didn't look thrilled with that idea, but there was no other way of getting to the altar, so he nodded reluctantly. I made a second set of hand signals, to the effect that I could jump and Harkat should remain where he was, but he shook his head and held up two stubby grey fingers, to show we should both go.</p><p>I jumped first. I crouched low, then leapt over the muscular coils of the giant beast. I landed softly, but spun quickly, not wishing to stand with my back to the Grotesque. It hadn't moved. Stepping aside, I nodded for Harkat to join me. He didn't leap quite as smoothly, but his feet cleared the monster, and I caught him as he landed, steadying him and muffling the sound.</p><p>We checked to make sure we hadn't disturbed the Grotesque, then faced the tall cylinder and studied the vials resting on see-through shelves within. Those at the top hadn't been filled, but there were dozens underneath, heavy with the thick poison from the Grotesque's fangs. The Kulashkas must have been milking the giant for decades to have amassed such a collection.</p><p>There was a frosty crystal front to the cylinder. I eased it open, reached inside, and pulled out a vial. It was cool and surprisingly heavy. I slipped it inside my shirt, pulled out a second vial and passed it to Harkat. He held it up to the light of the candles, scrutinizing the liquid inside.</p><p>As I was reaching for more vials, there was a shout from just inside the temple door. Looking up, startled, we saw two Kulashka children, a boy and girl. I raised my fingers to my lips and waved at the children, hoping they'd stop shouting, but that only agitated them more. The girl turned and shot out the doorway, doubtless fleeing to wake the adults. The boy remained and raced towards us, yelling and clapping, grabbing a candle to use as a weapon.</p><p>I knew instantly that we'd have to forget the rest of the vials. Our only hope was to get out quick, before the Grotesque awoke or the Kulashkas poured into the temple. The pair of vials we'd stolen would have to do. Leaving the door of the cylinder hanging open, I stepped down to where Harkat was waiting and we got ready to jump. But before we could leap, the Grotesque's rear section swished back, its head whipped up, and we found ourselves gazing straight into its furious red eye - and at its bared, sabre-like fangs!</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>WE FROZEon the altar, mesmerized by the Grotesque's glinting, demonic eye. As we stood rooted, helpless, its body unfurled and its head rose a metre or two, arcing backwards. It was preparing to attack, but by raising its head, it broke eye contact with us. We snapped out of our daze, realized what was about to happen, and dropped to the floor as the monster struck.</p><p>One of the Grotesque's long fangs caught me between my shoulder blades as I hit the floor. It dug into my flesh and ripped down my back. I yelled with pain and fear, rolled over as the beast released me, and slithered behind the crystal cylinder.</p><p>The Grotesque jabbed at me as I retreated but missed. It let out a bellow, like a giant baby's angry cry, then turned on Harkat. He was lying on his back, with his face and stomach exposed, an easy target. The Grotesque raised itself up to strike. Harkat got ready to throw his vial of poison at it. The Grotesque shrieked fiercely and withdrew a couple of metres, the fingers near its tail carrying it away from Harkat, the fingers near its head wriggling at him like dozens of snakes or eels. A detached part of me noticed that there were small holes on each finger where its nails would be if it was human, and the sweat came out of these holes in steady streams.</p><p>Harkat scrambled around to where I was sheltering. \"My back!\" I gasped, turning so that he could examine it. \"How bad is it?\"</p><p>Harkat studied my wound swiftly, then grunted. \"It's not very deep. It'll leave the mother of - all scars, but it won't kill you.\"</p><p>\"Unless there was poison in the fang,\" I muttered.</p><p>\"The Kulashkas milked it,\" Harkat said. \"Fresh poison couldn't - have formed already - could it?\"</p><p>\"Not in a snake,\" I said, \"but there's no telling with this thing.\"</p><p>I had no time to worry about it. The Grotesque slid around the altar, to attack us again. We backpedalled, keeping the cylinder between us and the Grotesque's bobbing head.</p><p>\"Any plans for - getting out?\" Harkat asked, drawing a knife but keeping his vial of poison in his left hand.</p><p>\"I'm taking this second by second,\" I panted.</p><p>We retreated steadily, circling around the cylinder again and again, the monster following impatiently, spitting and growling, its tongue flicking between its lips, ready to strike the instant we relaxed our guard. The Kulashka boy was standing on the path to the altar, cheering the Grotesque on.</p><p>A minute later, the rest of the Kulashkas poured into the temple. Most were carrying weapons, and their faces were filled with fury. Hurrying to the altar, they spread out around it, crawled over the Grotesque and moved in on us, murder in their angry white eyes.</p><p>\"This would be a good time to try talking to them,\" I said sarcastically to Harkat, but he took my wry advice seriously.</p><p>\"We mean no harm!\" he shouted. \"We want to be - your friends.\"</p><p>The Kulashkas stopped and murmured with astonishment when Harkat spoke. One of the men - I guessed it was their chief - stepped ahead of the others and pointed a spear at us. He shouted a question at Harkat but we couldn't understand what he was saying.</p><p>\"We don't speak your language,\" I said, following Harkat's lead, keeping one eye on the man and one on the Grotesque, which was still scrabbling after us, though it had pulled back slightly to make room for the Kulashkas. The chief shouted at us again, but slower this time, emphasizing each word. I shook my head. \"We can't understand you!\" I cried.</p><p>\"Friends!\" Harkat tried desperately. \"Amigos! Comrades! Buddies!\"</p><p>The Kulashka stared at us uncertainly. Then his expression hardened and he barked something at the rest of his clan. Nodding, they advanced, their weapons raised offensively, herding us towards the fangs of the giant Grotesque.</p><p>I stabbed at one of the Kulashka women with my knife, a warning gesture, trying to ward her off, but she ignored me and continued to close in, along with the others. Even the children were converging on us, small knives and spears held fast in their tiny hands.</p><p>\"Let's try the poison!\" I screamed at Harkat, pulling out my vial. \"They might scatter if we throw it at their eyes!\"</p><p>\"OK!\" he roared, and held his vial up high.</p><p>When the Kulashkas saw the vial in Harkat's grey hand, they froze with fear and most took a hasty step backwards. I was confused by their reaction, but seized on their fear and raised mine as well. When they saw another of the vials, the men, women and children spilt back off the platform, chattering fearfully, wildly waving their hands and weapons at us.</p><p>\"What's going on?\" I asked Harkat.</p><p>\"They're afraid of the - poison,\" he said, waving his vial at a handful of the Kulashka women - they screamed and spun away, covering their faces with their hands. \"It's either really sacred - to them, or really dangerous!\"</p><p>The Grotesque, seeing the Kulashkas grind to a halt, slid over the women and made for Harkat. One of the men darted ahead of the monster and waved his arms at it, shouting at the top of his lungs. The Grotesque paused, then swatted the man aside with its huge head and fixed its gaze on us again. It was snarling now - it meant to throw itself at us and finish us off. I drew back my vial to hurl at the beast, but a woman dashed between me and the Grotesque and waved her arms like the man had. This time the monster didn't swat the Kulashka aside, but stared fiercely at her as she crooned a song and waved her arms above her head.</p><p>When she had the full attention of the Grotesque, the woman stepped away from the altar and led the beast aside. The rest of the Kulashkas filed into the gap the Grotesque had left and stared at us hatefully - but also fearfully.</p><p>\"Keep your vial up!\" Harkat warned me, shaking his at the Kulashkas, who flinched miserably. Following a quick conference, a few of the women chased the children out of the temple and ran after them, leaving only the men and the sturdier, more warlike women.</p><p>The chief lowered his spear and again tried to communicate, making gestures with his hands, pointing to the Grotesque, the altar and the vials. We tried making sense of his signals, but couldn't.</p><p>\"We don't understand.'\" I shouted, frustrated. I pointed to my ears, shook my head and shrugged.</p><p>The chief cursed - I didn't need to speak his language to know that - then took a deep breath and said something to his clan. They hesitated. He barked the words again, and this time they parted, clearing a space between us and the path to the temple doorway. The chief pointed at the path, then us, then back at the path. He looked at us questioningly to seeif we understood.</p><p>\"You're going to - let us go?\" Harkat asked, repeating the Kulashka's gestures.</p><p>The chief smiled, then raised a warning finger. He pointed to the vials in our hands, then at the cylinder behind us. \"He wants us to replace the vials first,\" I whispered to Harkat.</p><p>\"But we need the - holy liquid,\" Harkat objected.</p><p>\"This is no time to dig your heels in!\" I hissed. \"They'll kill us if we don't do what they say!\"</p><p>\"What's to stop them killing - us anyway?\" Harkat asked. \"The vials are all that's - keeping us safe. If we abandon them, why shouldn't they - cut us down dead?\"</p><p>I licked my lips nervously, gazing at the Kulashka chief, who repeated his gestures, smiling warmly this time. I pointed to his spear when he finished. He looked at it, then tossed it away. He snapped at the rest of the Kulashkas and they too disposed of their weapons. Then they took another few steps away from us, spreading wide their empty hands.</p><p>\"We have to trust them,\" I sighed. \"Let's quit while we're ahead, put the vials back, and pray they're people of their word.\"</p><p>Harkat delayed for another frustrating moment, then nodded gruffly. \"OK. But if they kill us on - our way out, I'll never speak - to you again.\"</p><p>I laughed at that, then stepped up to the crystal cylinder to return the vial of poison to its rightful place. As I did, a bearded man stumbled out of the shadows of the temple, waving a jug over his head and whooping loudly. \"Fear not, lads! The fleet's here t' save ye!\"</p><p>\"Spits!\" I bellowed. \"No! We're sorting this out! Don't?\"</p><p>I never finished. Spits raced past the chief and smashed him over the head with a long curved knife. The chief fell, screaming, blood pumping from his scalp. The other Kulashkas yelled with confusion and anger, then dived for their weapons.</p><p>\"You moron!\" I roared at Spits as he bounded on to the altar. \"What the hell are you doing?\"</p><p>\"Saving ye!\" the ex-pirate yelled with delight. He was weaving heavily from side to side, drunker than I'd ever seen him, his eyes barely focused. \"Gimme that bottle o' pus,\" he grunted, snatching Harkat's vial from him. \"If this is what the freaks is scared of, this is what we'll let 'em have!\"</p>","<p>Spits raised the vial to lob at the Kulashkas. A loud shriek stopped him - the Grotesque was returning! Either the woman controlling it had been distracted by Spits's wild entrance, or she'd decided to set the beast on us. Either way, it was scampering towards us on its fingers at a frightening speed. In a couple of seconds it would be on us and the fight would be over.</p><p>Yelping with a drunken mixture of excitement and terror, Spits tossed the vial at the Grotesque. The glass missed its head, but connected with its long, fleshy body and smashed open. The instant it did, there was a huge explosion and the Grotesque and the floorboards beneath it disappeared in a spray of blood, flesh, bone and splintered wood.</p><p>The explosion blasted us from the platform and sent the Kulashkas crashing to the floor like bowling pins. I had just enough presence of mind to cradle my vial close to my chest as I fell, then tucked it inside my shirt to keep it safe as I rolled over on to my back in the aftermath of the blast. I now knew why the Kulashkas were so afraid of the vials - the Grotesque's venom was liquid explosive!</p><p>As I sat up, stunned, ears ringing, eyes stinging, I saw that the Grotesque wasn't the only casualty. Several of the Kulashkas - those who'd been closest to the monster - were lying dead on the floor. But I hadn't time to feel sorry for the Grotesque worshippers. The blast had also shattered a couple of the huge pillars supporting the roof, and as I watched, one pillar tipped over and crashed into another, which toppled into another and then another, like giant dominoes. Gazing up at the ceiling, I saw a series of cracks run across it, then huge chunks of the roof broke loose and cascaded down around the collapsing pillars. Within a matter of seconds the temple was going to fold in on itself, crushing all who lay within!</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>THOSE KULASHKASstill alive and alert to the danger fled for the doorway. Some made it to safety, but most were trapped beneath the pillars and roof, which caved in around them as they ran. Stumbling to my feet, I set off after the Kulashkas, but Harkat grabbed me. \"We'll never make it!\" he gasped.</p><p>\"There's no other way out!\" I screamed in reply.</p><p>\"Have to - shelter!\" he yelled, dragging me away from the main path. He hobbled across the floorboards, his green eyes darting from left to right as he watched for falling debris.</p><p>\"We're in fer it now!\" Spits hollered, popping up beside us, eyes alight with crazy drunken glee. \"Face the heavenly stairs and cough up yer prayers!\"</p><p>Harkat ignored the ex-pirate, dodged a chunk of heavy masonry, paused, then started jumping up and down on the spot. I thought he'd lost his mind, until I saw the hole in the floor where his foot had gone through earlier. Twigging to his plan, I bounced up and down beside him on the fragile floorboards. I didn't know how deep the pit was beneath, or if we'd be safe in it, but we couldn't fare any worse below than up here.</p><p>\"What in the devil's name are ye?\" Spits began. He got no further, because at that point the floor gave way and the three of us plummeted into darkness, yelling wildly as we fell.</p><p>We landed in a heap several metres beneath the temple, on a hard stone floor, Spits on top of Harkat and me. Groaning, I shoved Spits off - he'd been knocked out during the landing - and looked up. I saw part of the roof give way far overhead and come crashing down. Yelping, I stumbled to my feet and dragged Spits off to one side, cursing at Harkat to follow. There was a fierce, thunderous roar at our heels as we only just cleared the section of falling roof, which exploded upon contact with the floor and showered us with splinters and chips of stone.</p><p>Coughing - the force of the impact had raised a thick cloud of dust - we pushed ahead blindly, dragging Spits between us, into darkness and what we hoped was safety from the crumbling Temple of the Grotesque. After several frantic metres we came to a hole in the ground. Exploring with my hands, I said, \"I think it's a tunnel - but it drops sharply!\"</p><p>\"If it gets covered over - we'll be trapped,\" Harkat said.</p><p>There was a heavy bang overhead and the floorboards above us creaked ominously. \"We don't have a choice!\" I yelled, and crawled into the tunnel, bracing myself against the walls with my hands and feet. Harkat shoved Spits after me, then came himself - the tunnel was only just wide enough to accommodate his bulky body.</p><p>We clung near the top of the tunnel a few seconds, listening to the sounds of the destruction. I peered down the tunnel, but there was no light, and no way of telling how long it was. Spits's body weighed a ton and my feet began to slip. I tried digging in with my nails but the stone was too smooth and tough. \"We have to slide!\" I bellowed.</p><p>\"What if we can't get - back up?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"One crisis at a time!\" I shouted, and let go. I lay flat on my back, allowing my body to shoot down the tunnel. It was a short, fast ride. The tunnel dropped sharply for many metres, then gradually levelled out. I came to a stop several seconds later at the end of the tunnel, where I stretched out a foot, searching for the floor. I hadn't found it when the unconscious Spits barrelled into the back of me and sent me sprawling out into open space.</p><p>I opened my mouth to yell, but hit the ground before I could - the mouth of the tunnel was only a metre or two off the floor. Relieved, I got to my knees - and was promptly knocked flat when Spits toppled out on top of me. Swearing blindly, I pushed him off and was rising again when Harkat shot out of the tunnel and bowled me over.</p><p>\"Sorry,\" the Little Person muttered, easing himself off. \"Are you OK?\"</p><p>\"I feel like I've been run over by a steamroller,\" I groaned, then sat up and took deep breaths of the musty air, letting my head clear.</p><p>\"We've escaped being crushed by - the temple,\" Harkat noted after a while, as the noises echoing through the tunnel decreased and then ceased.</p><p>\"For whatever good it'll be,\" I grunted. I couldn't see my friend in the gloom of the underground cavern. \"If there's no way out, we'll face a slow, miserable death. We might wind up wishing we'd been squashed by a falling pillar.\"</p><p>Beside me, Spits groaned feebly, then muttered something unintelligible. There was the sound of him sitting up, then, \"What's happening? Where have the lights gone?\"</p><p>\"The lights, Spits?\" I asked innocently.</p><p>\"I can't see!\" he gasped. \"It's pitch black.'\"</p><p>\"Really?\" I said, eager to punish him for fouling things up with the Kulashkas. \"Ican see fine. How about you, Harkat?\"</p><p>\"Perfectly,\" Harkat murmured. \"I wish I had - sunglasses, it's so bright.\"</p><p>\"My eyes!\" Spits howled. \"I'm blind!\"</p><p>We let Spits suffer a while, before telling him the truth. He berated us with some choice insults for scaring him, but soon calmed down and asked what our next move would be.</p><p>\"I guess we walk,\" I answered, \"and see where we end up. We can't go back, and there are walls to the left and right?\" I could tell by the echoes of our voices \"?so it's straight ahead until a choice presents itself.\"</p><p>\"I blame ye fer this,\" Spits muttered. \"If ye hadn't gone prancing about in that bloody temple, we'd be waltzing through the fields now, with all the fresh air in the world t' breathe.\"</p><p>\"Weweren't the ones who - tossed bombs when there wasn't a need!\" Harkat snapped. \"We'd agreed a deal with - the Kulashkas. They were letting us go.\"</p><p>\"That lot?\" Spits snorted. \"They'd've strung ye up and had ye fer breakfast!\"</p><p>\"I'll stringyou up if you don't - shut your mouth,\" Harkat growled.</p><p>\"What's eating him?\" Spits asked me, stung by Harkat's tone.</p><p>\"Many Kulashkas died because of you,\" I sighed. \"If you'd stayed outside like you were supposed to, they needn't have.\"</p><p>\"Who cares about that lot?\" Spits laughed. \"They ain't of our world. What's the difference if some of 'em got squished?\"</p><p>\"They were people!\" Harkat roared. \"It doesn't matter what - world they were from. We had no right - to come in here and kill them! We?\"</p><p>\"Easy,\" I hushed him. \"We can't put it right now. Spits was only trying to help, in his clumsy, drunken way. Let's concentrate on finding a way out, and leave the finger-pointing for another time.\"</p><p>\"Just keep him away - from me,\" Harkat grumbled, pushing to the front and taking the lead.</p><p>\"That's not very polite,\" Spits complained. \"I thought, as an imp, he'd be delighted to cause havoc.\"</p><p>\"Be quiet,\" I snapped, \"or I'll change my mind and set him on you!\"</p><p>\"Crazy pair o' landlubbers,\" Spits snorted, but kept further comments to himself and fell in behind me as I stumbled after Harkat.</p><p>We limped along in silence for a number of minutes, disturbed only by the sound of Spits slurping from his jug of poteen (no fearthat got broken in the explosion!). It was completely dark in the tunnel. I couldn't see Harkat, even though he was only a metre or so ahead of me, so I concentrated on my sense of hearing, following him by sound alone. His large grey feet made a very distinctive noise, and because I was focusing on that, I didn't hear the other sounds until they were almost upon us.</p><p>\"Stop!\" I hissed suddenly.</p><p>Harkat came to an instant standstill. Behind me, Spits stumbled into my back. \"What're ye?\" he began.</p><p>I clamped a hand over his mouth, finding it with little difficulty from the stink of his breath. \"Not a word,\" I whispered, and through the throb of his lips I felt his heartbeat pick up speed.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" Harkat asked quietly.</p><p>\"We're not alone,\" I said, straining my ears. There were very slight rustling sounds all around us, ahead, at the sides, behind. The sounds stopped for a few seconds when we stopped, but then picked up again, slightly slower and quieter than before.</p><p>\"Something just crawled over my right foot,\" Harkat said.</p><p>I felt Spits stiffen. \"I've had enough o' this,\" he muttered fearfully, and made to pull away and run.</p><p>\"I wouldn't do that,\" I said softly. \"I think I know what this is. If I'm right, running would be avery bad idea.\"</p><p>Spits trembled but held his nerve and stood his ground. Releasing him, I bent to the ground slowly, as gracefully as I could, and gently laid a hand on the floor of the tunnel. A few seconds later, something crawled over my fingers, something with hairy legs - two - four - six - eight.</p><p>\"Spiders,\" I whispered. \"We're surrounded by spiders.\"</p><p>\"Is that all?\" Spits laughed. \"I'm not scared o' a few wee spiders! Stand aside, boys, and I'll stamp 'em out fer ye.\"</p><p>I sensed Spits raising a foot into the air. \"What if they're poisonous?\" I said. He froze.</p><p>\"I've a better one,\" Harkat said. \"Maybe these are babies. This is a world of - giants - the Grotesque and that monstrous toad. Whatif there are giant - spiders too?\"</p><p>At that, I froze like Spits had, and the three of us stood there, sweating in the darkness, listening - waiting - helpless.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>\"THEY'RE CRAWLINGup my leg,\" Spits said after a while. He hadn't lowered his foot and was trembling wildly.</p><p>\"And mine,\" Harkat said.</p><p>\"Let them,\" I said. \"Spits - lower your foot, as slowly as you can, and make sure you don't squash any of the spiders.\"</p><p>\"Can you talk to them and - control them?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"I'll try in a minute,\" I said. \"First I want to find out if these are all we have to deal with.\" I'd been fascinated by spiders when I was a kid. That's how I got mixed up with Mr Crepsley, through his performing tarantula, Madam Octa. I had a gift for communicating with arachnids and had learnt to control them with my thoughts. But that had been on Earth. Would my powers extend to the spiders here?</p><p>I penetrated the darkness with my ears. There were hundreds, maybe thousands of spiders in the tunnel, covering the floor, walls and ceiling. As I listened, one dropped on to my head and began exploring my scalp. I didn't brush it off. Judging from the noise and the feel of the spider on my head, these were medium-sized tarantulas. If there were any giant spiders, they weren't moving - maybe because they were waiting for us to walk into their lair?</p><p>I carefully raised my right hand and touched my fingers to the side of my head. The spider found them a few seconds later. It tested the new surface, then crawled on to my hand. I brought my hand and the spider down and around, so that I was facing it (even though I couldn't see it). Taking a deep breath, I focused my attention on the spider and began talking to it inside my head. When I'd done this in the past, I'd used a flute to help focus my thoughts. This time I just had to wing it and hope for the best.</p><p>\"Hello, little one. Is this your home? We're not intruders - we're just passing through. I can tell you're a beauty. Intelligent too. You can hear me, can't you? You understand. We're not going to harm you. We just want safe passage.\" As I continued talking to the spider, reassuring it of our peaceful intentions, flattering it and trying to get inside its head, I extended my range of thought and directed my words at the spiders around us. It's not necessary to control every spider in a huge pack, just those nearest to you. If you have the talent and experience, you can then use those spiders to control the rest. I could do that with spiders in my own world - were this lot the same, or were we doomed flies caught in an underground web?</p><p>After a couple of minutes, I put my abilities to the test. Bending, I let the spider crawl off my fingers on to the floor, then addressed the group around us. \"We need to move on now, but we don't want to hurt any of you. You'll have to spread out of our way. We can't see you. If you stay bunched together, we won't be able to avoid you. Move, my beauties. Slip to the sides. Let us pass freely.\"</p>","<p>Nothing happened. I feared the worst but kept on trying, talking to them, urging them to part. I'd have been more authoritative with normal spiders, and ordered them out of our way. But I didn't know how these would react to direct commands, and didn't want to risk angering them.</p><p>For two or three minutes I spoke to the spiders, asking them to move. Then, when I was almost on the point of quitting and making a break for freedom, Harkat said, \"They're climbing off me.\"</p><p>\"Me too,\" Spits croaked a moment later. He sounded on the verge of tears.</p><p>All around us the spiders were retreating, slowly edging out of our way. I stood, relieved, but didn't break mental contact with them. I kept on talking inside my head, thanking them, congratulating them, keeping them on the move.</p><p>\"Is it safe to advance?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I grunted, anxious not to lose my concentration. \"But slowly. Feel in front with your toes everytime you take a step.\"</p><p>I went back to communicating my thoughts to the spiders. Harkat edged ahead, one sliding step after another. I followed, keeping close, maintaining my link with the spiders. Spits stumbled along behind, holding on to my sleeve with one hand, clutching his bottle of poteen to his chest with his other.</p><p>We walked for a long time in this way, many of the spiders keeping pace with us, new recruits joining them further along the tunnel. No signs of any giants. It was hard work talking to them for such an extended amount of time, but I didn't let my concentration slip.</p><p>Finally, after twenty or thirty minutes, Harkat stopped and said, \"I've come to a door.\"</p><p>Stepping up beside him, I laid a hand on hard, smooth wood. It was covered in cobwebs, but they were old and dry, and brushed away easily at my touch. \"How do you know it's a door?\" I asked, momentarily breaking contact with the spiders. \"Maybe the tunnel's just blocked off.\" Harkat found my right hand and guided it to a metal handle. \"Does it turn?\" I whispered.</p><p>\"Only one way to - find out,\" he said, and together we twisted it down. There was almost no resistance, and the door swung inwards the instant the latch was retracted. A soft buzzing noise greeted us from inside. The spiders around us scuttled backwards half a metre.</p><p>\"I don't like this,\" I hissed. \"I'll go in alone and check it out.\" Moving ahead of Harkat, I entered the room and found myself standing on cold, hard tiles. I flexed my bare toes a few times, to be certain.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" Harkat asked when he didn't hear me moving.</p><p>\"Nothing,\" I said. Remembering the spiders, I re-established contact and told them to stay where they were. Then I took a step forward. Something long and thin brushed against my face - it felt like a giant spider leg! I ducked sharply - the spiders had guided us into a trap! We were going to be devoured by monster arachnids! We had to run, get out, flee for our lives! We ?</p><p>But nothing happened. I wasn't seized by long, hairy spider legs. There was no sound of a giant spider creeping towards me, intent on finishing me off. In fact there were no sounds at all, except for the strange buzzing and the fast, hard beating of my heart.</p><p>Rising slowly, I stretched out my arms and explored. My left hand found a long, narrow piece of cord hanging from above. Wrapping my fingers around it, I tugged softly. It resisted, so I tugged again, slightly harder. There was a click, then a harsh white light flooded the room.</p><p>I winced and covered my eyes - the light was blinding after the blackness of the tunnel. Behind me, I heard Harkat and Spits spin aside to avoid the glare. The spiders took no notice of it - living in utter darkness, they must have discarded their sense of sight some time in the past. \"Are you OK?\" Harkat roared. \"Is it a trap?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I muttered, spreading my fingers slightly in front of my eyes, allowing my pupils to adjust. \"It's just a ?\" I stopped as my fingers parted. Lowering my hands, I gazed around, bewildered.</p><p>\"Darren?\" Harkat said. When I didn't answer, he poked his head through the door. \"What's ??\" He stopped when he saw what I was looking at, and stepped into the room, speechless. Spits did the same moments later.</p><p>We were in a large kitchen, like any modern kitchen back on Earth. There was a fridge - the source of the buzzing - a sink, cupboards, a bread bin, a kettle, even a clock over the table, though the hands had stopped. Closing the door to the room to keep the spiders out, we quickly searched the cupboards. We found plates, mugs, glasses, cans of food and drink (no labels or dates on the cans). There was nothing in the fridge when we opened it, but it was in full working order. \"What's going on?\" Spits asked. \"Where'd all this stuff come from? And what's that?\" Hailing from the 1930s, he'd never seen a fridge like this before.</p><p>\"I don't?\" I started to answer, then stopped, my eyes falling on a saltcellar on the table - there was a piece of paper underneath, with a note scribbled across it. Removing the saltcellar, I scanned the note in silence, then read it out loud.</p><p>\"'Top of the morning to you, gentlemen! If you've made it this far, you're doing splendidly. After your narrow escape in the temple, you've earned a rest, so put your feet up and tuck into the refreshments - courtesy of this kitchen's previous owner, who never got round to enjoying them. There's a secret exit tunnel behind the refrigerator. It's a few hundred metres to the surface. After that, you face a short walk to the valley wherein lies the Lake of Souls. Head due south and you can't miss it. Congratulations on overcoming the obstacles to date. Here's hoping all goes well in the final stretch. Best regards, your dear friend and sincere benefactor - Desmond Tiny.'\"</p><p>Before discussing the note, we nudged the fridge aside and checked behind it. Mr Tiny had told the truth about the tunnel, though we wouldn't know for sure where it led until we explored it.</p><p>\"What do you think?\" I asked Harkat, sitting and pouring myself one of the fizzy drinks from the cupboard. Spits was busy examining the fridge, oohing and aahing with wonder at the advanced technology.</p><p>\"We have to do as - Mr Tiny says,\" Harkat replied. \"We were heading in a general - southerly direction anyway.\"</p><p>I glanced at the note again. \"I don't like the bit about 'here's hoping all goes well in the final stretch'. It sounds as though he thinks itwon't !'</p><p>Harkat shrugged. \"He might have said that - just to worry us. At least we know we're - close to the?\"</p><p>We were startled by a shrill cry. Leaping to our feet, we saw Spits turning away from one of the cupboards, which he'd moved on to after the fridge. He was shaking and there were tears in his eyes.</p><p>\"What is it?\" I yelled, thinking it must be something dreadful.</p><p>\"It's - it's ?\" Spits held up a bottle full of a dark golden liquid, and broke into a wet-eyed grin. \"It'swhisky !\" he croaked, and his face was as awe-filled as the Kulashkas' had been when they knelt before their Grotesque god.</p><p>Several hours later, Spits had drunk himself into a stupor and lay snoring on a rug on the floor. Harkat and I had eaten a filling meal and were resting against a wall, discussing our adventures, Mr Tiny and the kitchen. \"I wonder where all this - came from?\" Harkat said. \"The fridge, food and drinks - are all from our world.\"</p><p>\"The kitchen too,\" I noted. \"It looks to me like a nuclear fallout shelter. I saw a programme about places like this. People built underground shelters and stocked them with imperishable goods.\"</p><p>\"You think Mr Tiny transported an entire - shelter here?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"Looks that way. I've no idea why he'd bother, but the Kulashkas certainly didn't build this place.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Harkat agreed. He was silent a moment, then said, \"Did the Kulashkas remind you - of anyone?\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\"</p><p>\"There was something about their appearance - and the way they talked. It took me a while to work it out - but now I have it. They were like the Guardians of the Blood.\"</p><p>The Guardians of the Blood were strange humans who lived in Vampire Mountain and disposed of dead vampires in exchange for their internal organs. They had white eyes like the Kulashkas, but no pink hair, and spoke in a strange language which, now that I thought about it, did seem quite like the Kulashkas'.</p><p>\"Therewere similarities,\" I said hesitantly, \"but differences too. The hair was pink, and the eyes were a duller white colour. Anyway, how could they be related?\"</p><p>\"Mr Tiny might have transported - them here,\" Harkat said. \"Or maybe this is where the Guardians of the - Blood originally came from.\"</p><p>I mused that one over for a while, then rose and walked to the door.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" Harkat asked as I opened the door on to the tunnel.</p><p>\"Checking out a hunch,\" I said, crouching low and casting about with my eyes. Most of the spiders had left but a few were still close by, hunting for food or resting. I made mental contact with one and summoned it. It crawled on to my left hand and lay snugly in my palm as I lifted it to the light and examined it. It was a large grey spider with unusual green spots. I studied it from all sides, to be absolutely certain, then set it on the floor of the tunnel and closed the door again.</p><p>\"Ba'Shan's spiders,\" I said to Harkat. \"They're the spiders Madam Octa created when she bred with Ba'Halen's spiders in Vampire Mountain.\"</p><p>\"You're certain?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"They were named in my honour by Seba. I'm positive.\" I sat down again beside Harkat, my forehead creased as I picked away at the puzzle. \"Mr Tiny must have brought them here, like the kitchen, so I guess he could have brought some of the Guardians of the Blood too. But Ba'Shan's spiders aren't blind and the Guardians don't have pink hair. If Mr Tiny did bring them here, it must have been decades ago in this world's time, if not longer - they'd need that long to transform.\"</p><p>\"It seems like a lot of effort to - go to,\" Harkat said. \"Maybe he wanted the Guardians to build - the Temple of the Grotesque. And the kitchen might just have - been for a joke. But why bring the spiders?\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" I said. \"When you put them all together, they don't add up. There's something more to this, a bigger picture which we're missing.\"</p><p>\"Maybe the answer's in the kitchen,\" Harkat said, rising and slowly surveying the tiles, table and cupboards. \"The details are so fine. Maybe the answer is hidden - among them.\" He wandered around the room, gradually winding his way over to the fridge, where several postcards were attached by magnets to the door. They were from various tourist attractions on Earth - Big Ben, the Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, and so on. I'd seen them earlier but paid no attention.</p><p>\"Maybe there are clues or further - instructions on the back of these,\" Harkat said, taking down one of the cards. Turning it over, he studied it in silence, then quickly grabbed another, and another.</p><p>\"Anything?\" I asked. Harkat didn't answer. He was gazing down at the postcards, his lips moving silently. \"Harkat? Are you OK? Is something wrong?\"</p><p>Harkat's gaze flicked over me, then returned to the postcards. \"No,\" he said, tucking the cards away inside his tattered blue robes. He reached for the others.</p><p>\"Can I see the cards?\" I asked.</p><p>Harkat paused, then said softly, \"No. I'll show them to you - later. No point distracting ourselves now.\" That raised my interest, but before I could press to see the postcards, Harkat sighed. \"It's a shame we don't - have any of the holy liquid. I suppose we'll just have to ?\" He stopped when he saw me grin and reach inside my shirt. \"No way!\" he whooped.</p><p>I held up the vial I'd tucked away after being blown from the altar. \"Am I brilliant or what?\" I smirked.</p><p>\"If you were a girl - I'd kiss you!\" Harkat cheered, rushing over.</p><p>I passed the vial to him and forgot about the postcards. \"How do you think it works?\" I asked as he turned the vial around, careful not to slosh the explosive liquid. \"With all that force in its venom, surely the Grotesque should have blown its head off the first time it sunk its fangs into something.\"</p><p>\"It must not be explosive - to begin with,\" Harkat guessed. \"Maybe an element in the air - reacts with the poison after its release - and changes it.\"</p><p>\"A pretty big change,\" I laughed, then took the vial back. \"How do you think we're supposed to use it?\"</p><p>\"There must be something - we have to blow up,\" Harkat said. \"Perhaps the Lake is covered - and we have to blast a way through. What puzzles me more are the - globes.\" He picked out one of the gelatinous globes from within his robes and tossed it up and down. \"They must serve a - purpose, but I can't for the life of - me think what it is.\"</p><p>\"I'm sure it'll become clear,\" I smiled, tucking the vial away. Pointing at the sleeping Spits, I said, \"We should apologize to him when he wakes up.\"</p><p>\"What for?\" Harkat snorted. \"Killing the Kulashkas and almost - getting us killed too?\"</p><p>\"But don't you see? He wasmeant to. Mr Tiny wanted us to come here, but we wouldn't haveif Spits hadn't barged in. Without him, we'd have no holy liquid. And even if we'd managed to sneak a vial out of the temple, we wouldn't have known about its explosive properties - we'd have blown ourselves to bits!\"</p><p>\"You're right,\" Harkat chuckled. \"But I think an apology - would be wasted. All Spits cares about now - is his whisky. We could call him every foul - name in the world, or praise him - to the heavens, and he wouldn't notice.\"</p><p>\"True!\" I laughed.</p><p>We lay down after that and rested. I spent the quiet moments before sleep thinking about our adventures and the puzzle this world presented, and wondering what awful, life-threatening obstacles lay in wait for us at the end, in the valley of the Lake of Souls.</p>","<p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>AFTER Along sleep and a hot meal, courtesy of a small gas stove, we packed some tins and drinks (Spits made the three remaining bottles of whisky his first priority), along with a few of the longer knives, and exited the underground kitchen. I switched off the light before we left - a force of habit from the time when my mum would roar whenever I left lights on around the house.</p><p>The tunnel was a couple of hundred metres long and ended in the side of a riverbank. The exit was blocked with loose stones and sandbags, but they were easy to remove. We had to jump into the river and wade across to dry land, but the water was shallow. On the far bank we got undercover quickly and hurried away through the tall stalks of grass. We were anxious not to run into any Kulashka survivors.</p><p>It was midday when we left the kitchen. Although we'd previously travelled at night, we marched steadily all day, hidden by the tall grass. We stopped late in the night to sleep, and set off early the next morning. That evening we cleared the grasslands. We were delighted to leave the tall grass behind - we were covered in burs and insects and nicked all over from the sharp edges of the blades. The first thing we did was find a pool of water and wash ourselves clean. After that we ate, rested a few hours, then headed south, reverting to our previous pattern of walking by night and sleeping by day.</p><p>We expected to come upon the valley at every bend - Mr Tiny had said it was a short walk - but another night passed without any sight of it. We were worried that we'd taken the wrong path, and discussed backtracking, but early the next night the ground rose to a peak and we instinctively knew that our goal lay on the other side. Harkat and I hurried up the rise, leaving Spits to catch up in his own time (he'd been drinking heavily and was making slow progress). It took us half an hour to reach the top. Once there, we saw that we were at the head of the valley - and we also saw the enormity of the task ahead.</p><p>The valley was long and green, with a small lake - a glorified pond, as Mr Tiny had accurately called it - set in the centre. Apart from that, the valley was featureless - except for five dragons resting around the edge of the water!</p><p>We stood staring down into the valley at the dragons. One looked like the creature which had attacked us on the raft. Two were smaller and slimmer, probably females - one had a grey head, the other white. The remaining two were much smaller - infants.</p><p>As we studied the dragons, Spits approached, panting heavily. \"Well, lads,\" he wheezed, \"is this the valley or ain't it? If it is, let's sing a wee sea shanty t' celebrate our?\"</p><p>We jumped on him before he burst into song, and smothered his startled cries. \"What's going on?\" he yelped through my fingers. \"Are ye mad? 'Tis me - Spits!\"</p><p>\"Quiet!\" I hushed him. \"Dragons!\"</p><p>He snapped out of his drunkenness. \"Let me see!\" We rolled off and let him wriggle forward to the edge of the overhang. His breath caught in his throat when he saw the dragons. He lay there for a minute, studying them silently, then returned to our side. \"I recognize two of 'em. The biggest is the one that attacked ye in the lake by my shack. I've seen the one with the grey head too, but not the others.\"</p><p>\"Do you think they're just - resting?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>Spits tugged on his straggly beard and grimaced. \"The grass round the Lake has been trampled flat in a big wide circle. 'Twouldn't have got that way if they'd only been here a while. I think this is their den.\"</p><p>\"Will they move on?\" I asked.</p><p>\"No idea,\" Spits said. \"Mebbe they will - though I doubt it. They're safe from attack here - they'd see anything coming long before it reached 'em - and the land around is teeming with animals and birds for 'em to feed on. Plus, my lake's not far off - as the dragon flies - with all the fish they could wish fer.\"</p><p>\"They've children too,\" Harkat noted. \"Animals normally stay where - they are when they're rearing their young.\"</p><p>\"So how are we going to get to the Lake of Souls?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Are ye sure thatis the Lake?\" Spits asked. \"It looks awful small t' be home to a load o' dead souls.\"</p><p>\"Mr Tiny said it would be small,\" I told him.</p><p>\"There could be another lake nearby,\" Spits said hopefully.</p><p>\"No,\" Harkat grunted. \"This is it. We'll just have to keep watch and - wait for them to leave - they have to hunt - for food. We'll move in when they go and - hope they don't return too quickly. Now, who wants to creep forward and - take first watch?\"</p><p>\"I'll go,\" I said, then snatched Spits's bottle from him as he made to slug back a shot. I also grabbed his sack, where his other bottles were stowed.</p><p>\"Hey!\" he protested.</p><p>\"No more whisky until this is over,\" I told him. \"You're taking the next watch - and you're taking it sober.\"</p><p>\"You can't boss me about!\" he griped.</p><p>\"Yes I can,\" I growled. \"This is serious business. I'm not having you fly off the handle like you did in the temple. You can have some whisky before you go on watch, and when you come off, but between those times - not a drop.\"</p><p>\"And if I refuse?\" he snarled, reaching towards his long curved knife.</p><p>\"We'll break the whisky bottles,\" I said simply, and his face went white.</p><p>\"I'd kill ye if ye did!\" he croaked.</p><p>\"Aaarrr,\" I grinned, \"but that wouldn't bring yer whisky back!\" Handing the bottle and sack to Harkat, I winked at Spits. \"Don't worry - when we're through, you can drink all the whisky you want.\" Then I hurried forward to find a bush to hide behind and observe the dragons.</p><p>We kept watch for almost a week before accepting that we'd have to revise our plan. At least three dragons remained in the valley at any given time, usually the two young ones and a female, though sometimes the male took one of the youngsters hunting with him. There was no way of telling when the absent dragons would return - sometimes the male was gone overnight, while other times he'd sweep back to his family within minutes, a bleating sheep or goat clutched between his claws.</p><p>\"We'll just have to - sneak in one night and hope - they don't spot us,\" Harkat said as we debated our options. We were in a rough cave we'd dug in the soil of the hill, to hide us from the dragons when they took flight.</p><p>\"Them dragons have awful good eyesight,\" Spits said. \"I seen 'em spot prey from hundreds o' feet up on nights as black as a shark's soul.\"</p><p>\"We could try burrowing to the Lake,\" I suggested. \"The soil isn't hard-packed - I'm sure I could dig a way through.\"</p><p>\"And when you broke through - to the Lake?\" Harkat asked. \"The water would flood the tunnel - and we'd all drown.\"</p><p>\"We ain't chancing that!\" Spits said quickly. \"I'd rather be ate by one o' them demons than drowned!\"</p><p>\"There must a way to get past them,\" I groaned. \"Maybe we could use the explosive Grotesque poison - wait until they're grouped together, sneak up close and lob it among them.\"</p><p>\"I doubt we'd be able to - get close enough,\" Harkat said. \"And if even one of them survived..</p><p>\"If we had more'n one vial, we'd have nowt to worry about,\" Spits sighed. \"We could walk in and toss a vial at 'em any time they came near. Mebbe we should go back t' the temple and search fer more vials.\"</p><p>\"No,\" I frowned. \"That's not the answer - even if they didn't blow up during the blast, they'd be buried under rubble. But you're on to something ?\" I took out my vial of \"holy liquid\" and examined it. \"Mr Tiny knew that we'd crash through the floorboards and make our way to the kitchen, so maybe he also knew we'd only grab a single vial.\"</p><p>\"Then one must be enough,\" Harkat muttered, taking the vial from me. \"There must be a way we can - use it to get to the Lake.\"</p><p>\"'Tis a pity Boom Boom Billy ain't with us,\" Spits chuckled. When we looked at him blankly, he explained. \"Boom Boom Billy was a wonder with bombs. He knew all about dyn**ite and gunpowder, and how t' blow things up. The cap'n often said Billy was worth his weight in gold.\" Spits chortled. \"Which made it all the funnier when he blew himself up trying t' crack open a chest full of ingots!\"</p><p>\"You've got a warped sense of humour, Spits,\" I sniffed. \"I hope that one day you?\" I stopped, eyes narrowing. \"Bombs!\" I exclaimed.</p><p>\"You have an idea?\" Harkat asked excitedly.</p><p>I shushed him with a wave of a hand, thinking furiously. \"If we could make bombs out of the 'holy liquid'?\"</p><p>\"How?\" Harkat asked. \"We know nothing about - bombs, and even if we did, we don't - have anything to make them with.\"</p><p>\"Don't be so sure about that,\" I said slowly. Reaching inside my shirt, I took out the piece of cloth I'd wrapped my share of the gelatinous globes in, and carefully unrolled them on to the floor. Picking up a jelly-like ball, I squeezed it softly between my fingers, watching the thin liquid within ooze from side to side. \"By themselves, these globes are worthless,\" I said. \"The 'holy liquid' is worthless too - by itself. But if we put them together ?\"</p><p>\"Are you thinking of covering - the globes with the liquid?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"No,\" I said. \"It would drop off on to the ground and explode. But if we could inject itinto the globes ?\" I trailed off into silence, sensing I was close to the answer, but unable to make the final leap in logic.</p><p>With a sudden grunt, Harkat beat me to the punch. \"The tooth!\" He dug through his robes for the bag of teeth he'd taken from the black panther.</p><p>\"What're they?\" Spits asked, never having seen the teeth before.</p><p>Harkat didn't answer, but sorted through them until he found the hollow tooth with the K carved on it. Holding it up, he blew through the tooth to make sure it was clear, then passed it to me, his green eyes shining brightly. \"You have smaller fingers,\" he said.</p><p>Picking up a globe, I brought the tip of the tooth close to it, then stopped. \"We'd better not try this here,\" I said. \"If something goes wrong.</p><p>\"Agreed,\" Harkat said, shuffling towards the mouth of the cave. \"Besides, we'll have to test them - to make sure they work. We'd best do that - out of earshot of the dragons.\"</p><p>\"What're ye on about?\" Spits whined. \"Ye ain't making sense!\"</p><p>\"Just follow close behind,\" I winked. \"You'll see!\"</p><p>We made our way to a copse of thick, stunted trees a few kilometres away. Once there, Harkat and Spits huddled behind a fallen trunk, while I squatted in a clearing and laid several gelatinous globes and the panther's tooth on the earth around me. With extreme care, I uncorked the vial of explosive poison. It smelt like cod-liver oil. I set the vial down, lay out flat on my stomach and placed one of the globes directly in front of me. With my left hand, I gently jabbed the sharp, narrow end of the panther's tooth into the globe. When it was sticking in half a centimetre, I picked up the vial with my right hand, brought its lip to the rim of the tooth, and poured.</p><p>I was sweating furiously as the first drops trickled into the tooth - if they exploded this close to my face, I was dead meat. But, like treacle, the liquid rolled slowly down the hole inside the tooth, then into the soft gelatinous globe.</p><p>I filled the tooth to the top - it didn't hold very much - then removed the vial and waited for all the liquid to seep into the globe. It took a minute, but eventually the globe had absorbed all of the deadly poison from the tooth.</p><p>Keeping my hands steady, I removed the tip of the tooth from the top of the globe and held my breath, watching the jelly-like material close over the tiny hole, until it was no more than a pinprick in the skin of the globe. Once it had closed as far as it was going to, I corked the vial, set the tooth aside, and stood. \"It's done,\" I called to Harkat and Spits.</p><p>Harkat crept over. Spits stayed where he was, eyes wide, hands over his head. \"Take the vial and tooth,\" I told Harkat. \"Lay them where Spits is, so they're out of harm's way.\"</p><p>\"Do you want me to - come back to help?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>I shook my head. \"I can throw it further than you. I'll test it myself.\"</p><p>\"But you're a half-vampire,\" he said. \"You took a vow never to use - missile-firing weapons or bombs.\"</p><p>\"We're on another world - as far as we know - and facing a bunch of dragons - I think this qualifies as an exceptional circumstance,\" I said dryly.</p><p>Harkat grinned, then swiftly retreated with the vial, my share of the globes and the panther's tooth. When I was alone, I crouched, took hold of the poison-filled globe, and cautiously picked it up. I winced as my fingers tightened around the globe, expecting it to blow up in my face - but it didn't. I turned the globe over, to see if any of the liquid spilt out. Detecting no leaks, I stood, swung my arm back, then lobbed the globe at a gnarly tree in the distance.</p><p>The instant the globe was out of my hand, I ducked and covered my head with my hands, following the globe's flight through the cracks between my fingers. It soared cleanly ahead, before connecting with the tree. When it hit the trunk, the shell of the globe smashed, the liquid splashed with great force over the wood, and the air was rent with the sound of a sharp explosion. My fingers snapped closed and I buried my face in the ground. When, a few seconds later, I raised my head and opened my eyes, I saw the top half of the tree topple over, torn to shreds in the middle.</p><p>Getting up slowly, I studied the shattered tree, then turned and smiled at Harkat and Spits, who were also on their feet. Taking a cheeky bow, I hooted, \"Move over Boom Boom Billy - there's a new kid in town!\"</p>","<p>Then Harkat and Spits were racing towards me, whooping with excitement, eager to make some bombs of their own.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>EARLY AFTERNOONthe next day. We'd been waiting for the male dragon to go hunting. Ideally, we'd like to have waited until he took one of the females or young dragons with him, but he usually only made short trips when accompanied. Our best bet was to make our move when he was off hunting by himself, in the hope that he wouldn't return while we were in the valley.</p><p>Finally, near the end of my watch, the dragon unfurled his long wings and took to the sky. I hurried off to alert Harkat and Spits.</p><p>We'd filled the remaining thirty-two globes with liquid from the vial. The vial was still about a third full, and I carried it in my shirt, keeping it in reserve. Harkat and I had divided the globes between us, giving none to Spits, even though he'd argued bitterly for a share. There were two reasons why we kept the globes from him. Firstly, it was our aim to scare off the dragons, not kill them. Neither of us wished to destroy such mystical, marvellous creatures, and we couldn't trust Spits not to go bomb-happy. The second reason was that we needed him to concentrate on fishing. The pirate had held on to his net, despite all we'd been through - he had it wrapped around his chest - and he was the best qualified to fish for Harkat's soul. (We weren't sure what form the souls in the Lake would take, or how we'd recognize Harkat's, but we'd worry about that when - if! - we got there.)</p><p>\"Ready?\" I asked, crawling out of our makeshift cave, four small globes cradled in my hands.</p><p>\"Ready,\" Harkat said. He was carrying six of the globes - his hands were bigger than mine.</p><p>\"Aaarrr,\" Spits growled, still sour about not being given any bombs. He'd been in a foul mood most of the week, due to the tiny amount of whisky we'd limited him to.</p><p>\"When this is over,\" I tried to cheer him up, \"you can drink all the whisky you like and get steaming drunk, OK?\"</p><p>\"I like the sound o' that!\" he chuckled.</p><p>\"Are you looking forward to - getting home?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"Home?\" Spits frowned, then grinned sickly. \"Aaarrr. 'Twill be great. I wish we was there already.\" His eyes shifted nervously and he looked away quickly, as though he'd been caught stealing.</p><p>\"We'll go in three abreast,\" I told Spits, shuffling to the top of the hill. \"You take the middle. Head straight for the Lake. We'll protect you.\"</p><p>\"What if the dragons don't flee from the bombs?\" Spits asked. \"Will ye let 'em have it in the gob?\" Spits thought we were crazy for not wanting to blow up the dragons.</p><p>\"We'll kill them if we have to,\" I sighed. \"But only if there's no other way.\"</p><p>\"And only after they've - eaten you,\" Harkat added, then laughed when Spits cursed loudly at him.</p><p>Forming a line, we checked ourselves one last time. Harkat and I were carrying everything we owned in our pockets, and Spits had his sack slung over his shoulder. Taking deep breaths, we shared crooked grins, then started down into the valley, where the four dragons were waiting.</p><p>A young dragon spotted us first. It was playing with its sibling - the pair often chased each other around the valley, like two overgrown kittens. When it saw us, it drew up short, flapped its wings and screeched warningly. The heads of the female dragons shot up, their hot yellow eyes fierce above their long purple faces.</p><p>The female with the grey head got to her feet, spread her wings, flapped them firmly and soared into the air. She circled around, screeching, then directed her snout at us and zoomed in. I could see her nostrils expanding as she prepared to blow fire.</p><p>\"I'll deal with this one,\" I called to Harkat, stepping forward and holding up one of the larger globes. I judged my moment finely, waited until the dragon was almost directly overhead, then threw the globe hard into the earth and ducked. It exploded, sending soil and pebbles flying up into the dragon's face. She screamed with panic and veered sharply away to the left.</p><p>The second female took to the air at the sound of the explosion, and the young dragons followed, adopting a position several metres above their mothers, who hovered side by side.</p><p>While the dragons hung in the air, we hurried towards the Lake of Souls, Harkat and I watching our every footstep, all too aware of the consequences if we stumbled and smashed the deadly globes. Spits was muttering over and over, \"Better be worth it! Better be worth it! Better be ?\"</p><p>The female dragons split up and attacked us on two fronts at the same time, swooping out of the sky like a couple of comets. Harkat and I waited, then threw our globes at the same time, confusing the dragons with loud explosions and blinding geysers of earth and stones.</p><p>The dragons dogged our steps all the way to the Lake, attacking in turn or together every minute or so, only pulling clear when we launched our globes. One of the young dragons tried to join in, but its mother shot a warning streak of fire at it, frightening it back to its previous safe height.</p><p>As we progressed, I realized the dragons were intelligent creatures. After the first few explosions, they no longer flew into the blasts but pulled up short as soon as they saw us lobbing the globes. On a couple of occasions I tried to outfox them by just pretending to toss a globe, but they obviously saw through my ploy and only withdrew when I actually launched one.</p><p>\"They'll keep coming until we run out of globes!\" I roared at Harkat.</p><p>\"Looks that way!\" Harkat yelled back. \"Have you been keeping track - of how many you've used?\"</p><p>\"I think seven or eight.\"</p><p>\"Me too,\" Harkat said. \"That only leaves us with about - half our original supply. Enough to get us to the - Lake - but not to get back!\" \"If we're going to retreat, we'll have to do it now,\" I noted.</p><p>To my surprise, Spits answered before Harkat could. \"No!\" he yelled, his face alight. \"We're too close t' pull back!\"</p><p>\"Spits seems to be getting into the spirit of the adventure,\" I laughed.</p><p>\"The time he picks to - develop a backbone!\" Harkat snorted in reply.</p><p>We hurried on to the Lake and arrived a couple of minutes later, having used another two globes. The female dragons pulled away when they saw us draw up to the edge of the Lake. They hovered in the air with their children, high above our heads, observing suspiciously.</p><p>Spits was the first to gaze into the water of the Lake of Souls, while Harkat and I kept a watch on the dragons. After a few seconds he fell to his knees and moaned softly. \"It's beautiful! All I ever dreamt, and more!\"</p><p>Staring over my shoulder to see what he was babbling about, I found myself gazing into murky blue water, in which swam hundreds upon hundreds of shimmering human figures. Their bodies and faces were pale and ill defined, some swelling out and sucking in, almost like a fish puffing itself up and returning to its normal size. Others were squashed into tiny balls or stretched out to impossible lengths. All swam in slow, mournful circles, listless, oblivious to distractions, their blinking eyes or flexing fingers the only signs that they weren't totally lifeless. A few of the shapes drifted towards the upper levels of the Lake every now and then, but none broke the surface of the water. I got the impression that they couldn't.</p><p>\"The souls of the dead,\" Harkat whispered. Both of us had turned our backs on the dragons, momentarily captivated by the spectacle of the Lake.</p><p>Most of the figures twisted slowly as they swam, so that their faces revolved in and out of sight. Every face was a picture of loneliness and sorrow. This was a lake of misery. Not agony - nobody seemed to be in pain - just sadness. I was studying the faces, filled with a sense of pity, when I spotted one I knew. \"By the black blood of Harnon Oan!\" I shouted, taking an involuntary step back.</p><p>\"What is it?\" Harkat asked sharply - he thought I'd found the person he used to be.</p><p>\"Murlough!\" It was less than a breath on my lips. The first vampaneze I ever encountered. Consumed by madness, he'd lost control and had been killing people in Mr Crepsley's home city. We'd tracked him down and Mr Crepsley killed him. The vampaneze looked exactly the way he had when he died, only his purple sheen was muted by the water of the Lake and the depth he was swimming at.</p><p>As I watched, Murlough sunk downwards, slowly dropping from sight into the lower reaches of the Lake. A shiver ran down my spine. I'd never thought to look upon Murlough's face again. It had dredged up many bad memories. I was lost in thought, transported to the past, reliving those long ago nights, wondering what other souls I might find here. Not Mr Crepsley - Evanna had told me his soul was in Paradise. But what about the first vampaneze I'd killed? Gavner Purl? Arra Sails? Kur?</p><p>\"Beautiful,\" Spits murmured, breaking my train of thought. He looked up at me and his eyes were wet with happy tears. \"The little man in the yellow galoshes told me 'twould be like this but I never believedit till now. \"All my dreams would come true\", he said. Now I know he wasn't lying.\"</p><p>\"Never mind your dreams!\" I snapped, recalling the danger we were in. I put Murlough from my thoughts and spun to keep both eyes on the dragons. \"Get fishing, quick, so we can get out of here!\"</p><p>\"I'll get fishing, sure enough,\" Spits giggled, \"but if ye thinks I'm leaving this pool o' sunken treasures, ye're crazier than them Kulashkas!\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" Harkat asked, but Spits didn't answer immediately, only unravelled his net with measured care and fedit into the still water of the Lake of Souls.</p><p>\"I was considered a prize on thePrince o' Pariahs ,\" the pirate said softly. \"Nobody cooked as fine a meal as Spits Abrams. The cap'n used to say I was second in importance only t' Boom Boom Billy, and when Billy blew himself up, I became the most valuable man aboard. Every pirate would've sold his mother fer a bowl o' Spits's famous stew, or a slice of his delicious roast meat.\"</p><p>\"He's cracking up!\" I yelled.</p><p>\"I don't think so,\" Harkat said nervously, studying Spits as he focused on his net, lips drawn back over his teeth, eyes burning with a frightening inner light.</p><p>\"They never asked where the meat came from,\" Spits continued, swishing his net through the water. The souls in the Lake parted and swam around the net automatically, but their glum expressions didn't change. \"Even when we'd been at sea fer months on end, and all the other supplies had run out, I was able t' slap up as much meat as they could eat.\"</p><p>The pirate paused and his mouth grew tight with anger. \"When they found out, they said I wasn't human and didn't deserve t' live. But they knew. Deep down, they must've guessed, and they went on chewing regardless. 'Twas only when a new man caught me and made a fuss that they had to admit it. Hypocrites!\" he roared. \"They was a stinking bunch o' lying, double-faced hypocrites, fit only t' roast in the fires o' hell!\"</p><p>Spits's face grew crafty and he laughed maniacally, drawing his net out, checking its condition, then lowering it back into the water. \"But since the devil couldn't be bothered with 'em, I'll treat 'em to a fire of me own. Aaarrr! They thought they'd seen the last o' Spits Abrams when they tossed me overboard. But we'll see who has the last laugh when they're draped on a spit, sizzling slowly over my flames!\"</p><p>\"What's he talking about?\" I croaked.</p><p>\"I think I understand,\" Harkat whispered, then spoke to Spits. \"How many of the people - that you fished from the sea - did youkill ?\"</p><p>\"Most of 'em,\" Spits giggled. \"In the heat o' battle, nobody took any notice of them what jumped overboard. I kept the occasional one alive, t' show off t' the cap'n and crew. But I slit the throats o' most and hid the bodies in the galley.\"</p><p>\"And then you carved them - up, cooked them and served them - to the pirates,\" Harkat said hollowly, and I felt my stomach churn.</p><p>\"What?\" I gasped.</p><p>\"That's Spits's big secret,\" Harkat said sickly. \"He was a cannibal and he turned his - crewmates into cannibals too!\"</p><p>\"They loved it!\" Spits howled. \"They'd've gone on eating Spits's grub fer ever and said nowt if that new lad hadn't walked in on me while I was carving up a nice fat vicar and his wife! After that, they acted disgusted and treated me like a monster.\"</p><p>\"I've eaten human flesh,\" Harkat said quietly. \"Little People will eat anything. When I first came back from the dead, my thoughts - weren't my own, and I ate with the rest. But we only ate the flesh - of those who'd died naturally. We didn't kill. And we didn't take pleasure - from it. Youare a monster, even to someone - like me.\"</p><p>Spits sneered. \"Come off it, imp! I know why ye're really here - t' feast yer chops on Spits's stew! Shan boy too!\" His eyes fixed on me and he winked crookedly. \"Ye thought I didn't know what ye was, but Spits ain't as dumb as he lets on. Ye're a bloodsucker! Ye fed from me when ye thought I was asleep. So don't play the innocents, lads - 'twon't work!\"</p><p>\"You're wrong, Spits,\" I said. \"I drink blood to survive, and Harkat's done things in the past that he's ashamed of. But we aren't killers or cannibals. We don't want any part of your unholy feast.\"</p><p>\"We'll see if ye think that way when ye smell the cooking,\" Spits cackled. \"When yer lips are drooling and yer bellies growling, yell come running, plates out, begging fer a thick, juicy slice o' thigh.\"</p><p>\"He's completely out of his mind,\" I whispered to Harkat, then called aloud to Spits. \"Have you forgotten the dragons?We'll get roasted and eaten if we stand around gabbing!\"</p>","<p>\"They won't bother us,\" Spits said confidently. \"The Tiny man told me. He said as long as I stayed within eight feet o' the Lake, the dragons couldn't harm me - they can't come this close. There's a spell on the Lake. Unless a living person jumps or falls in, the dragons can't come near.\"</p><p>Spits stopped dragging on his net and gazed at us calmly. \"Don't ye see, lads? We don't ever need t' leave. We can stay here the rest of our lives, fishing fer dinner each day, all the water we can drink. Tiny said he'd drop by if we made it, and promised t' provide me with pots and material t' build fires. We'll have t' eat our catch raw till then, but I've ate humans raw before - not as tasty as when cooked, but ye won't have cause fer complaint.\"</p><p>\"That'syour dream!\" Harkat hissed. \"Not to return to our world, but to stay - here for ever, fishing for the souls - of the dead!\"</p><p>\"Aaarrr!\" Spits laughed. \"Tiny told me all about it. The souls don't have bodies in the water - them's just ghosts that we see. But once they're dragged on to dry land, they become real, the way they was before they died. I'll be able t' kill 'em again and carve 'em up any way I like. An unending supply - including the souls o' the cap'n and most o' the others on thePrince o' Pariahs ! I can have revenge on top of a full stomach!\"</p><p>There was a heavy thud behind us - the male dragon had returned and set down close to where we were standing. I raised a globe to throw at him, but then I saw that he wasn't coming any closer. Spits was right about the dragons not being able to approach the Lake.</p><p>\"We can't let you do it,\" I said. Focusing on Spits, I started walking towards him.</p><p>\"Ye can't stop me,\" he sniffed. \"If ye don't want t' stay, ye can leave. I'll fish up the imp's soul and ye can take yer chances with the dragons. But there's nowt ye can do t' make me go with ye. I'm staying.\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said. \"We won't let you.\"</p><p>\"Stay back!\" Spits warned, lowering his net and drawing a knife. \"I like ye both - ye're decent sorts fer a vampire and an imp! - but I'll slice the skin clean off yer bones if I have t'!\"</p><p>\"Don't try, Spits,\" Harkat said, stepping up behind me. \"You've seen us in action. You know we're stronger and faster - than you. Don't make us hurt you.\"</p><p>\"I ain't scared o' ye!\" Spits shouted, backing away, waving his knife at us. \"Ye need me more than I need ye! Unless ye back off, I won't fish yer soul out, and this'll all have been fer nowt!\"</p><p>\"I don't care,\" Harkat said softly. \"I'd rather blow my chance - and die, than leave you here to torment the souls - of the dead and feed upon them.\"</p><p>\"But they're bad 'uns!\" Spits howled. \"These ain't the souls o' good people - they're the souls o' the lost and damned, who couldn't get int' heaven.\"</p><p>\"It doesn't matter,\" Harkat said. \"We won't let you - eat them.\"</p><p>\"Crazy pair o' landlubbers,\" Spits snarled, coming to a halt. \"Ye think ye can rob me o' the one thing that's kept me going all these years alone in this hellhole? 'Twasn't enough fer ye t' rob me o' me whisky - now ye wants t' take me meat away too! Well damn ye, demons o' the dark - damn ye both t' hell!\"</p><p>With that shrill cry, Spits attacked, slicing wildly with his knife. We had to leap back quickly to avoid being gutted by the raging ex-pirate. Spits raced after us, whooping gleefully, chopping with his knife. \"Gonna slice ye up and cook ye!\" he howled. \"The dead can wait - I'll feast onyer flesh tonight! I'm gonna see what ye're made of inside. I never ate a vampire or imp before - 'twill make fer an interesting comparison!\"</p><p>\"Spits!\" I roared, ducking out of the way of his knife. \"Stop now and we'll let you live! Otherwise we'll have to kill you!\"</p><p>\"Only one man'll be doing any killing today!\" Spits retorted. \"Spits Abrams, scourge o' the seas, lord o' the Lake, sultan o' chefs, king o'?\"</p><p>Before Spits got any further, Harkat slid inside his stabbing range and grabbed his knife arm. Spits screamed at the Little Person and punched him with his free fist. When that didn't have any effect, he pulled a whisky bottle out of his sack and prepared to break it over Harkat's head.</p><p>\"No you don't!\" I grunted, seizing Spits's forearm. I squeezed tightly, until I heard bones cracking. Spits screeched painfully, dropped the bottle and spun away from me. I released him and he retreated sharply, breaking free of Harkat's grip, collapsing on the ground a couple of metres away. \"Quit it!\" I yelled as Spits staggered to his feet and drew another bottle, cradling his injured arm across his chest.</p><p>\"Never!\" he cried. \"I've still got one good hand. That'll be enough t'?\" He stopped when he saw us freeze, our eyes widening. \"What're ye up t' now?\" he asked suspiciously. We couldn't answer, only gaze wordlessly at the space behind him. Spits sensed that we weren't trying to trick him, and whipped around to see what we were staring at. He found himself gazing up into the fierce cold eyes of the male dragon.</p><p>\"Is that all that's bothering ye?\" Spits hooted. \"Didn't I tell ye they couldn't come next nor near us as long as we stayed ?\"</p><p>He trailed off into silence. He looked down at his feet, then at us, then at the Lake - which was about four or five metres away from where he was standing!</p><p>Spits could have made a run for it, but didn't. With a bitter smile, he shook his head, spat into the grass, and muttered, \"Aaarrr!\" The dragon opened its mouth wide when Spits said that - as though he'd been awaiting an order - and blew a huge ball of fire over the stranded ex-pirate. Spits disappeared in flames and Harkat and I had to cover our eyes and turn aside from the heat.</p><p>When we looked again, a fiery Spits was stumbling towards us, arms thrashing, face invisible beneath a mask of red flames. If he was screaming, we couldn't hear him over the crackle of his burning hair and clothes. We lunged out of his way as Spits staggered closer. He continued past us, oblivious to our presence, and didn't stop until he reached the edge of the Lake of Souls and toppled in.</p><p>Snapping out of our daze, we raced to the Lake in case there was anything we could do to help Spits. But we were too late. He was already deep under water, arms still moving, but weakly. As we watched, the shimmering shades of the dead surrounded the pirates body, as though guiding it on its way. Spits's arms gradually stopped waving, then his body sunk deeper into the water, until it vanished from sight in the murky gloom of the soul-filled depths.</p><p>\"Poor Spits,\" Harkat croaked. \"That was awful.\"</p><p>\"He probably deserved it,\" I sighed, \"but I wish it could have happened some other way. If only he'd?\"</p><p>A roar stopped the words dead in my throat. My head shot around and I spotted the male dragon, hovering in the air close above us, eyes gleaming. \"Don't worry,\" Harkat said. \"We're close to the Lake. It can't ?\" The words died on his lips and he stared at me, his green eyes filling with fear.</p><p>\"The spell!\" I moaned. \"Spits said it would only last until a living person fell into the Lake! And he was still alive when ?\"</p><p>As we stood trembling, the dragon - no longer bound by the spell - opened his jaws wide and coughed a ball of fire straight at us - meaning to finish us off the same way he'd killed Spits!</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>IREACTEDquicker to the flames than Harkat - I'd been badly burnt many years earlier, and had no wish to suffer the same fate again. I hurled myself into the Little Person, knocked him clear of the blast and rolled after him. As the flames zipped past us, out over the water of the Lake - momentarily illuminating the faces of the dead trapped within - I reached for a globe and hurled it at the ground beneath the dragon. There was a large explosion and the dragon peeled away, roaring - this was his first exposure to our explosives.</p><p>\"Hurry!\" I shouted at Harkat. \"Give me your globes, grab the net and fish your soul out!\"</p><p>\"I don't know how - to fish!\" Harkat howled.</p><p>\"There's no better time to learn!\" I bellowed, then threw another globe as one of the females swooped upon us.</p><p>Harkat swiftly unloaded his globes and laid them on the ground by my feet. Then, grabbing Spits's abandoned net, he pulled it out of the Lake, paused a moment to clear his thoughts, and slowly fed the net in. As he did, he muttered softly, \"I seek my soul, spirits - of the dead. I seek my soul, spirits - of the dead. I seek my?\"</p><p>\"Don't talk!\" I yelled. \"Fish!\"</p><p>\"Quiet!\" Harkat hissed. \"This is the way. I sense it. I must call upon my soul to - lure it into the net.\"</p><p>I wanted to ask how he'd figured that out, but there was no time - the male and both females were attacking, the females from the left and right, the male floating out over the Lake, in front of us. Scaring off the females with two hastily thrown globes, I studied the dragon angling down towards the surface of the Lake. If I threw a globe at the Lake, it wouldn't burst. That meant I'd have to aim for the dragon itself, and possibly kill him. It seemed a shame, but there were no other options.</p><p>I was getting a fix on the dragon when an idea struck me. Hurling the globe out on to the water in front of the approaching beast, I grabbed a nearby pebble, took careful aim, and sent it flying at the globe. It struck just as the dragon was nearing the globe, showering the creature's face with a seething funnel of water.</p><p>The dragon pulled out of its attack and arced away into the air, screeching its frustration. The females almost sneaked in while I was dealing with the male, but I spotted them just in time and scattered them with another blast. While the dragons regrouped overhead, I did a quick globe count - eight remained, plus the vial.</p><p>I wanted to tell Harkat to hurry, but his face was knitted together fiercely as he bent over the net, whispering softly to the souls in the Lake, searching for the soul of the person he used to be. To disturb him would be to delay him.</p><p>The dragons attacked again, in the same formation as before, and once again I successfully repelled them, leaving myself with five lonely-looking globes. As I picked up three more, I considered aiming to kill - after these three, I'd be down to my final pair - but as I studied the dragons circling in the air, I was again struck by their awesome majesty. This was their world, not ours. We had no right to kill them. What if these were the only living dragons, and we wiped out an entire species just to save our own necks?</p><p>As the dragons attacked once more, I still wasn't sure what I intended to do with the explosive globes. Clearing my mind, I allowed my self-defence mechanism to kick in and make the choice for me. When I found my hands pitching the globes short of the dragons, scaring them off but not killing them, I nodded grimly. \"So be it,\" I sighed, then called to Harkat, \"I can't kill them. After the next attack, we're done for. Do you want to take the globes and?\"</p><p>\"I have it!\" Harkat shouted, hauling ferociously on the net, the strings of which tightened and creaked alarmingly. \"A few more seconds! Buy me just a - few more seconds!\"</p><p>\"I'll do what I can,\" I grimaced, then faced the dragons, which were homing in on us as before, patiently repeating their previous manoeuvre. For the final time I sent the females packing, then pulled out the vial, tossed it on to the surface of the Lake, and smashed it with a pebble. Some glass must have struck the male dragon when the vial exploded, because he roared with pain as he peeled away.</p><p>Now that there was nothing else to do, I hurried to Harkat and grabbed hold of the net. \"It's heavy!\" I grunted, feeling the resistance as we tugged.</p><p>\"A whopper!\" Harkat agreed, grinning crazily.</p><p>\"Are you OK?\" I roared.</p><p>\"I don't know!\" he shouted. \"I'm excited but terrified! I've waited so long - for this moment, and I still - don't know what to expect!\"</p><p>We couldn't see the face of the figure caught in the strands of the net - it was turned away from us - but it was a man, light of build, with what looked to be dirty blond hair. As we pulled the spirit out of the Lake, its form glittered, then became solid, a bit at a time, first a hand, then an arm, followed by its other hand, its head, chest ?</p><p>We had the rescued soul almost all the way out when I caught sight of the male dragon zooming towards us, his snout bleeding, pain and fury in his large yellow eyes. \"Harkat!\" I screamed. \"We're out of time!\"</p><p>Glancing up, Harkat spotted the dragon and grunted harshly. He gave the net one last desperate tug. The body in the net shot forward, its left foot solidifying and clearing the water with a pop similar to a gun's retort. As the dragon swooped down on us, its mouth closed, nostrils flaring, working on a fireball, Harkat spun the body over on to its back, revealing a pale, confused, horrified face.</p><p>\"What the??\" I gasped.</p><p>\"It can't be!\" Harkat croaked, as the man in the net - impossibly familiar - stared at us with terror-filled eyes.</p><p>\"Harkat!\" I roared. \"That can't be who you were!\" My gaze flicked to the Little Person. \"Can it?\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" Harkat said, bewildered. He stared at the dragon - now almost upon us - then down at the man lying shivering on the shore. \"Yes!\" he shouted suddenly. \"That's me! I'm him! I know who I was! I?\"</p><p>As the dragon opened its mouth and blew fire at us with all the force it could muster, Harkat threw his head back and bellowed at the top of his voice, \"I was the vampire traitor ?Kurda Smahlt !\"</p><p>Then the dragon's fire washed over us and the world turned red.</p>","<p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>IFELLto the ground, clamping my lips and eyes shut. Clambering to my knees, I tried to crawl out of the ball of fire before I was consumed to the bone?</p><p>?then paused when I realized that although I was surrounded by the dragon's flames, there wasn't any heat! I opened my left eyelid a fraction, ready to shut it again quick. What I saw caused both my eyes to snap open and my jaw to drop with astonishment.</p><p>The world around me had stopped. The dragon hung frozen over the Lake, a long line of fire extending from its mouth. The fire covered not just me, but Harkat and the na**d man ?Kurda Smahlt ! - on the ground. But none of us was burnt. The static flames hadn't harmed us.</p><p>\"What's going on?\" Harkat asked, his words echoing hollowly.</p><p>\"I haven't a clue,\" I said, running a hand through the frozen fire around me - it felt like warm fog.</p><p>\"Over - there!\" the man on the ground croaked, pointing to his left.</p><p>Harkat and I followed the direction of the finger and saw a short, tubby man striding towards us, beaming broadly, playing with a heart-shaped watch.</p><p>\"Mr Tiny!\" we shouted together, then cut through the harmless flames - Harkat grabbed Kurda under the arms and dragged him out - and hurried to meet the mysterious little man.</p><p>\"Tight timing, boys!\" Mr Tiny boomed as we came within earshot. \"I didn't expect it to go that close to the wire. A thrilling finale! Most satisfying.\"</p><p>I stopped and stared at Mr Tiny. \"You didn't know how it would turn out?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Of course not,\" he smirked. \"That's what made it so much fun. A few more seconds and you'd have been toast!\"</p><p>Mr Tiny stepped past me and held out a cloak to Harkat and his na**d companion. \"Cover the poor soul,\" Mr Tiny punned.</p><p>Harkat took the cloak and draped it around Kurda's shoulders. Kurda said nothing, just stared at the three of us, his blue eyes wide with suspicion and fear, trembling like a newborn baby.</p><p>\"What's going on?\" I snapped at Mr Tiny. \"Harkat can't have been Kurda - he was around long before Kurda died!\"</p><p>\"What do you think, Harkat?\" Mr Tiny asked the Little Person.</p><p>\"It's me,\" Harkat whispered, studying Kurda intensely. \"I don't know how - but it is.\"</p><p>\"But it can't?\" I began, only for Mr Tiny to interrupt curtly.</p><p>\"We'll discuss it later,\" he said. \"The dragons won't stay like this indefinitely. Let's not be here when they unfreeze. I can control them normally, but they're in quite an agitated state and it would be safer not to press our luck. They couldn't harm me, but it would be a shame to lose all of you to their fury at this late stage.\"</p><p>I was anxious for answers, but the thought of facing the dragons again enabled me to hold my tongue and follow quietly as Mr Tiny led us out of the valley, whistling chirpily, away from the lost remains of Spits Abrams and the other dead spirits held captive in the Lake of Souls.</p><p>Night. Sitting by a crackling fire, finishing off a meal which two of Mr Tiny's Little People had prepared. We were no more than a kilometre from the valley, out in the open, but Mr Tiny assured us that we wouldn't be disturbed by dragons. On the far side of the fire stood a tall, arched doorway, like the one we'd entered this world by. I longed to throw myself through it, but there were questions which needed to be answered first.</p><p>My eyes returned to Kurda Smahlt, as they had so often since we'd pulled him out of the Lake. He was extremely pale and thin, his hair untidy, his eyes dark with fear and pain. But otherwise he looked exactly as he had the last time I saw him, when I'd foiled his plans to betray the vampires to the vampaneze. He'd been executed shortly afterwards, dropped into a pit of stakes until he was dead, then cut into pieces and cremated.</p><p>Kurda felt my eyes upon him and glanced up shamefully. He no longer shook, though he still looked very uncertain. Laying aside his plate, he wiped around his mouth with a scrap of cloth, then asked softly, \"How much time has passed since I was put to death?\"</p><p>\"Eight years or so,\" I answered.</p><p>\"Is that all?\" He frowned. \"It seems much longer.\"</p><p>\"Do you remember everything that happened?\" I asked.</p><p>He nodded bleakly. \"My memory's as sharp as ever, though I wish it wasn't - that drop into the pit of stakes is something I'd rather never think about again.\" He sighed. \"I'm sorry for what I did, killing Gavner and betraying the clan. But I believed it was for the good of our people - I was trying to prevent a war with the vampaneze.\"</p><p>\"I know,\" I said softly. \"We've been at war since you died, and the Vampaneze Lord has revealed himself. He ?\" I gulped deeply. \"He killed Mr Crepsley. Many others have died as well.\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry,\" Kurda said again. \"Perhaps if I'd succeeded, they'd still be alive.\" He grimaced as soon as he said that, and shook his head. \"No. It's too easy to say 'what if' and paint a picture of a perfect world. There would have been death and misery even if you hadn't exposed me. That was unavoidable.\"</p><p>Harkat hadn't said much since we'd sat down - he'd been studying Kurda like a baby watching its mother. Now his eyes roamed to Mr Tiny and he said quietly, \"I know I was Kurda. Buthow? I was created years before - Kurda died.\"</p><p>\"Time is relative,\" Mr Tiny chuckled, roasting something that looked suspiciously like a human eyeball on a stick over the fire. \"From the present, I can move backwards into the past, or forward into any of the possible futures.\"</p><p>\"You can travel through time?\" I asked sceptically.</p><p>Mr Tiny nodded. \"That's my one great thrill in life. By playing with time, I can subtly influence the course of future events, keeping the world on a chaotic keel - it's more interesting that way. I can help or hinder humans, vampires and vampaneze, as I see fit. There are limits to what I can do, but I work broadly and actively within them.</p><p>\"For reasons of my own, I decided to help young Master Shan,\" he continued, addressing his words to Harkat. \"I've laid many plans around that young man, but I saw, years ago, that he was doomed for an early grave. Without someone to step in at vital moments - for instance, when he fought with the bear on his way to Vampire Mountain, and later with the wild boars during his Trials of Initiation - he would have perished long ago.</p><p>\"So I created Harkat Mulds,\" he said, this time speaking to me. He swallowed the eyeball he'd been cooking and belched merrily. \"I could have used any of my Little People, but I needed someone who'd cared about you when he was alive, who'd do that little bit extra to protect you. So I went into a possible future, searched among the souls of the tormented dead, and found our old friend Kurda Smahlt.\"</p><p>Mr Tiny slapped Kurda's knee. The one-time General flinched. \"Kurda was a soul in agony,\" Mr Tiny said cheerfully. \"He was unable to forgive himself for betraying his people, and was desperate to make amends. By becoming Harkat Mulds and protecting you, he provided the vampires with the possibility of victory in the War of the Scars. Without Harkat, you would have died long ago, and there would have been no hunt for the Lord of the Vampaneze - he would simply have led his forces to victory over the vampires.\"</p><p>\"But I didn't know - that I used to be Kurda!\" Harkat protested.</p><p>\"Deep down you did,\" Mr Tiny disagreed. \"Since I had to return your soul to the past, I had to hide the truth of your identity from you - if you'd known who you were, you might have tried to directly interfere with the course of the future. But on a subconscious level, you knew. That's why you fought so bravely beside Darren, risking your life for his on numerous occasions.\"</p><p>I thought about that in silence for a long while, as did Harkat and Kurda. Time travel was a difficult concept to get my head around, but if I overlooked the paradox of being able to send a soul from the future into the past to alter the present - and didn't question how it was achieved - I could see the logic. Kurda had betrayed the vampires. Ashamed, his soul remained bound to Earth. Mr Tiny offered him the chance of redemption - by returning to life as a Little Person, he could make amends for his foul deeds.</p><p>\"There's something I don't understand,\" Kurda said, then winced. \"Actually, there'sloads I don't understand, but one thing in particular. My plan to betray the vampires would have succeeded if Darren hadn't interfered. But you say Darren would have died without my aid as Harkat Mulds. So, in effect, I helped Darren mastermind my own downfall!\"</p><p>Mr Tiny shook his head. \"You would have perished regardless of the outcome. Your death was never in question - merely the manner of it.\"</p><p>\"What puzzlesme the most,\" Harkat muttered, \"is how - the two of us can be here at the same - time. If I'm Kurda and he's - me, how can we exist together?\"</p><p>\"Harkat's wiser than he looks,\" Mr Tiny noted with a chuckle. \"The answer is that youcan't - at least, not for very long. While Kurda remained in the Lake of Souls, Harkat was free to roam the world. Now that Kurda has emerged, one must make way for the other.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I asked sharply.</p><p>\"Kurda and Harkat share the same soul,\" Mr Tiny explained, \"but while a soul can be split, it can only lay claim to one body at any given time. As the original, Kurda has a natural claim to existence. Even now, the strands of Harkat's form are unravelling. Within a day his body will dissolve, releasing his share of their soul. A split soul can never be rejoined - Harkat and Kurda are two different people. Since this is the case, Harkat's half of their soul must depart this world. It's nature's way.\"</p><p>\"You mean Harkat's going to die?\" I yelled.</p><p>\"He's dead already,\" Mr Tiny chuckled.</p><p>\"Stop splitting hairs!\" I growled. \"Will Harkat perish if we stay here?\"</p><p>\"He'll perish wherever you are,\" Mr Tiny replied. \"Now that Kurda's soul has been given form, only he has the power to spare Harkat's body.\"</p><p>\"If I can save Harkat, I will,\" Kurda said immediately.</p><p>\"Even if it costs you your own newly restored life?\" Mr Tiny asked slyly.</p><p>Kurda stiffened. \"What are you talking about?\"</p><p>Mr Tiny stood and stretched. \"There's much I can't tell you,\" he said. \"But I'll explain as best I can. There are two ways in which I can create a Little Person - from a soul's resurrected body - the one which forms when a person is fished from the Lake of Souls - or from their corpse. With Harkat, I used Kurda's original remains.\"</p><p>\"But Kurda's body was burnt to ashes,\" I interrupted.</p><p>\"No,\" Mr Tiny said. \"When I decided to use Kurda's soul, I returned to the time of his death and convinced the Guardians of the Blood to switch his body with another's. I used Kurda's bones to make Harkat. The deal I then made with him was that in return for his new body, he'd travel with Darren and protect him, and later, if he did as instructed, I'd free his soul - he wouldn't have to return to the Lake.</p><p>\"Well, Harkat has performed admirably and is most deserving of his reward. If Kurda chooses, he can walk away a free man now. He can live out the rest of his renewed life, however long or short that proves to be. Harkat's body will fall apart, his soul will be freed, and I'll have upheld my end of the bargain.\"</p><p>\"To live again!\" Kurda whispered, eyes bright.</p><p>\"Or,\"Mr Tiny added with cruel relish, \"we can strike a new deal and Kurda can sacrifice himself.\"</p><p>Kurda's eyes narrowed. \"Why would I do that?\" he snapped.</p><p>\"You and Harkat share a soul, but it's a soul which I have helped divide into two parts. If you let me destroy your new body, your part of your shared spirit will depart this realm instead of Harkat's. Harkat will become your soul's sole physical vessel. I can't guarantee him immunity from the Lake of Souls in that case, but he may return home with Darren and live out his life. His future will be his own - if he lives a good life and dies well, the Lake will have no claim on him.\"</p><p>\"That's a despicable choice to present me with,\" Kurda growled.</p><p>\"I don't make the laws,\" Mr Tiny shrugged. \"I just obey them. One of you can live - the other must bid farewell to life. I could make the call and just kill one of you, but wouldn't you rather decide for yourselves?\"</p><p>\"I suppose,\" Kurda sighed, then looked at Harkat and grinned. \"No offence, but if we were to decide on the basis of good looks, I'd win hands down.\"</p><p>\"And if we judged it - on loyalty,\" Harkat responded, \"Iwould win, since I have - never betrayed my friends.\"</p><p>Kurda grimaced. \"Would you want to live?\" he asked Harkat. \"The Lake is a hellish place. Mr Tiny's offering you a guaranteed escape. Maybe you want to take it?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Harkat said. \"I don't want to let go - of life. I'd rather go back with Darren and take my chances.\"</p><p>Kurda looked at me. \"What do you reckon, Darren?\" he asked softly. \"Should I grant Harkat life or set his soul free?\"</p><p>I started to answer but Harkat cut in. \"Darren has nothing to do - with this. Much of my memory ?your ... memory - is returning. A lot is clear now. I know you the same way I - know myself. You always went your own way - even to the point of betraying your people - when you thought it was for their best. Be the man in death that - you were in life. Decide for yourself.\"</p><p>\"He put that quite well,\" Mr Tiny murmured.</p><p>\"Couldn't have said it better myself,\" Kurda agreed, grinning sickly. Standing, he turned in a complete, slow circle, studying the dark world beyond the light of the fire, thinking deeply. Then he sighed and faced Mr Tiny. \"I've had my fill of life. I made my choices and accepted the consequences. This is Harkat's time. I belong to death - let it have me.\"</p>","<p>Mr Tiny smiled strangely, almost warmly. \"Your decision makes no sense to me but I admire you for it. I promise your death will be swift and painless, and your departure for whatever glories or terrors which lie beyond will be instant.\"</p><p>Mr Tiny stepped over to the arched doorway. He held up his heart-shaped watch and it glowed a deep red colour. Within seconds the doorway and the small man's face were glowing too. \"Through you go, boys - the home fires are burning and your friends are waiting.\"</p><p>\"Not yet!\" I shouted. \"I want to know where we are and how Evanna got here and why you stocked that kitchen underground and where the dragons came from and why?\"</p><p>\"Your questions must wait,\" Mr Tiny stopped me. His face was glowing red and he looked more frightening than anything we'd faced during the course of our journey. \"Go now, or I'll leave you here to the dragons.\"</p><p>\"You wouldn't!\" I snorted, but I was in no position to call his bluff. Walking to the doorway, followed by Harkat, I stopped and gazed back at Kurda Smahlt, about to face death for the second time. There was so much I wanted to say to him, so much I wanted to ask him. But there was no time. \"Thank you,\" I whispered simply.</p><p>\"Yes - thank you,\" Harkat added.</p><p>\"What's a life between friends?\" Kurda laughed, then grew serious. \"Make it count. Lead a good life, so you'll have no regrets when you die. That way your soul will fly free, and you won't be at the beck and call of meddlers like Desmond Tiny.\"</p><p>\"If not for we meddlers, who would hold the fabric of the universe together?\" Mr Tiny countered. Then, before we could pursue the conversation any further, he barked, \"You must go now - or stay for ever!\"</p><p>\"Goodbye, Kurda,\" Harkat said numbly.</p><p>\"Farewell,Sire ,\" I saluted him.</p><p>Kurda didn't answer, just waved shortly and turned his head aside. I think he was crying. And then, leaving many questions unanswered, but having successfully achieved what we set out to, Harkat and I turned away from the living corpse, the Lake of Souls, the dragons, the Grotesque and other creatures of this twisted place, and walked through the glowing doorway, back to the world of our own.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>MR TALLwas waiting for us when we stepped through the doorway, standing beside a fire much like the one we'd left behind, close to the vans and tents of the Cirque Du Freak, but separated from the campsite by a row of trees. His small mouth was stretched into a smile as he stepped forward to shake our hands. \"Hello, Darren. Hello, Harkat. I'm delighted about your safe return.\"</p><p>\"Hello, Hibernius,\" Harkat greeted the Cirque owner - it was the first time he'd ever called him that.</p><p>\"Ah!\" Mr Tall beamed. \"Your mission was a success - as Kurda, you always called me Hibernius.\"</p><p>\"Good to see you again - old friend,\" Harkat said. His voice hadn't changed, but he somehow sounded different.</p><p>As we sat around the fire, I asked where our other friends were. Mr Tall told us most were sleeping - it was late and everyone was tired after that night's performance.</p><p>\"I've known for the last week that you were due to return - if you managed to make it back alive - but I wasn't sure of the exact date. I've been making a fire and waiting beside it for several nights. I could wake the others, but it would be better to wait and announce your return in the morning.\"</p><p>We agreed to let our friends slumber. Harkat and I began telling Mr Tall about our adventures in the mysterious world through the glowing doorway (which crumbled to ash shortly after we stepped through). Mr Tall was fascinated and listened in rapt silence, asking virtually no questions. We only meant to tell him the highlights - and save the majority of the tale for when we had more listeners - but once we started, we couldn't stop, and over the nextfew hours we told him all that had happened. The only time he interrupted was when we mentioned Evanna - he stopped us there and asked a lot of questions about her.</p><p>There was a long silence at the end, as the three of us stared into the dying embers of the fire and thought about our battles and narrow escapes, the fate of the deranged Spits Abrams, the wondrous dragons, the great revelation and Kurda's unenviable choice.</p><p>\"Will Mr Tiny really kill Kurda?\" I asked after a while.</p><p>Mr Tall nodded sadly. \"A soul can divide but it cannot share two bodies. But Kurda made the right choice - Harkat will remember most of what Kurda experienced while alive, and in that way Kurda will live on. Had Kurda chosen life, all of Harkat's memories would have been lost to the world. This way they both win.\"</p><p>\"A cheery thought to end on,\" Harkat said, smiling. He yawned and stared up at the moon. \"How much time has passed since - we were away?\"</p><p>\"Time has been the same for us as for you,\" Mr Tall said. \"Some three months have slipped by. It is summer now.\"</p><p>\"Any news about the War of the Scars?\" I asked.</p><p>\"None,\" Mr Tall said shortly.</p><p>\"I hope Debbie and Alice reached Vampire Mountain,\" I muttered. During my months away, I'd only rarely stopped to wonder what was happening back home. Now I was anxious to catch up on all that I had missed.</p><p>\"I wouldn't trouble myself if I were you,\" Mr Tall said, seeing the questions in my eyes. \"This is where you and Harkat are meant to be right now. The War of the Scars will find you again when destiny decrees. For the time being, relax and enjoy this calm between the storms.\"</p><p>Mr Tall stood and smiled at us. \"I'll leave you now. Get as much sleep as you need - I'll see that you are not disturbed.\" As he turned to leave, he paused and glanced back at Harkat. \"It would be wise to wear your mask again, now that the air is no longer safe.\"</p><p>\"Oh!\" Harkat gasped. \"I forgot!\" Digging out a mask, he tied it around his mouth, breathed through it afew times to make sure there weren't any rips, then lowered it so that he could speak clearly. \"Thanks.\"</p><p>\"Don't mention it,\" the tall man chuckled.</p><p>\"Mr Tall,\" I said quietly, as he turned to leave again. \"Do you know where we were? Was that world a different planet, the past, an alternate reality?\"</p><p>The Cirque owner said nothing and didn't look back - just shook his head and hurried on towards the camp.</p><p>\"He knows,\" I sighed. \"But he won't tell.\"</p><p>Harkat grunted. \"Did you bring anything - back with you?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Only my clothes,\" I said. \"And I don't plan on hanging on to these rags - they can go straight in the bin!\"</p><p>Harkat smiled, then rifled through his robes. \"I still have the postcards I took - from the underground kitchen, as well as - the panther's teeth.\" He spilt the teeth on to the grass and turned them so all the letters were face up. He idly began arranging them to form his name, but as he got to the end of \"Harkat\", he stopped, quickly scanned all the teeth, and groaned.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" I asked sharply.</p><p>\"Remember Mr Tiny saying at the - start that we'd find a clue to who I was - when we killed the panther?\" Harkat quickly rearranged the letters on the teeth to form another name ?KURDA SMAHLT !</p><p>I stared at the letters, then groaned like Harkat had. \"The answer was in front of us all along - your name's an anagram! If we'd spent more time on the letters after we'd killed the panther, we could have solved the puzzle and skipped the rest of the ordeal.'\"</p><p>\"I doubt it would have been - that simple,\" Harkat laughed. \"But at least I now know where - my name came from. I used to wonder - how I'd picked it.\"</p><p>\"On the subject of names,\" I said, \"are you sticking with Harkat Mulds or reverting to your original name?\"</p><p>\"Harkat Mulds or Kurda Smahlt,\" Harkat muttered, and said the names a few more times. \"No,\" he decided. \"Kurda's the person I used - to be. Harkat's the person I've become. We are the same in some ways - but different in many others. I want to be known - as Harkat.\"</p><p>\"Good,\" I said. \"It would have been very confusing otherwise.\"</p><p>Harkat cleared his throat and looked at me oddly. \"Now that you know the truth - about me, does it change anything? As Kurda, I betrayed you and - all the vampires. I killed Gavner Purl. I will understand if you don't - think as highly of me as you - did before.\"</p><p>\"Don't be stupid,\" I grinned. \"I don't care who you used to be - it's who youare that matters. You've long made up for any mistakes in your previous life.\" I frowned. \"But does this change howyou feel aboutme !\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"The reason you stuck by me before was that you needed my help to find out who you were. Now that you know, maybe you'd like to head off and explore the world by yourself. The War of the Scars isn't your battle any longer. If you'd rather go your own way ?\" I trailed off into silence.</p><p>\"You're right,\" Harkat said after a couple of thoughtful moments. \"I'll leave first thing in - the morning.\" He stared seriously at my glum features, then burst out laughing. \"You idiot! Of course I won't go! This is my war as much as - it's yours. Even if I hadn't been a - vampire, I wouldn't leave. We've been through too much - together to split up now. Maybe when the war is over - I'll seek a path of my own. For the time being I still feel - bound to you. I don't think we're meant - to part company yet.\"</p><p>\"Thanks,\" I said simply. It was all that needed to be said.</p><p>Harkat gathered up the panther's teeth and put them away. Then he studied the postcards, turned one over and gazed at it moodily. \"I don't know if I should - mention this,\" he sighed. \"But if I don't, it will - gnaw away at me.\"</p><p>\"Go on,\" I encouraged him. \"Those cards have been bothering you since you found them in the kitchen. What's the big mystery?\"</p><p>\"It has to do with - where we were,\" Harkat said slowly. \"We spent a lot of time wondering where - we'd been taken - the past, another world - or a different dimension.\"</p><p>\"So?\" I prodded him when he stalled.</p><p>\"I think I know the answer,\" he sighed. \"It ties it all together, why - the spiders were there - and the Guardians of the Blood, if that's - who the Kulashkas really were. And the kitchen. I don't think Mr Tiny put the kitchen - there - I think it was in place - all along. It was a nuclear fallout shelter, built to - survive when all else fell. I think it was put to the test - and it passed. I hope I'm wrong, but I'm - afraid I'm not.\"</p><p>He passed a postcard to me. On the front was a picture of Big Ben. There was writing on the back, a typical tourist's account of their holiday - \"Having a great time, weather good, food fab.\" The name at the bottom and the name and address on the right-hand side of the postcard meant nothing to me.</p><p>\"What's the big deal?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Look at the postmark,\" Harkat whispered.</p><p>What I saw confused me. \"That date can't be right,\" I muttered. \"That's not for another twelve years.\"</p><p>\"They're all like that,\" Harkat said, passing the rest of the postcards to me. \"Twelve years ahead - fifteen - twenty - more.\"</p><p>\"I don't get it,\" I frowned. \"What does it mean?\"</p><p>\"I don't think we were in the past or - on a different world,\" Harkat said, taking the postcards back and tucking them away. He stared at me ominously with his large green eyes, hesitated a moment, then quickly mumbled the words which turned my insides cold. \"I think that barren, monster-filled wasteland - wasthe future!\"</p>"]},{"title":"Lord of the Shadows","pages":["<p>PROLOGUE</p><p>In the distance a wave of blood was building. Red, towering, topped with spitting heads of fire. On a vast plain, a mass of vampires waited. All three thousand or so faced the onrushing wave. At the rear, separated from the crowd, I stood alone. I was trying to push forward - I wanted to be with the rest of the clan when the wave hit - but an invisible force held me back.</p><p>As I struggled, roaring silently - my voice didn't work here - the wave swept ever nearer. The vampires pulled closer together, terrified but proud, facing their deaths with dignity. Some were, pointing spears or swords at the wave, as though they could fight it back.</p><p>Closer now, almost upon them, half a kilometre high, stretching in an unbroken line across the horizon. A wave of crackling flames and boiling blood. The moon disappeared behind the crimson curtain and a blood-red darkness descended.</p><p>The foremost vampires were eaten by the wave. They screamed in agony as they were crushed, drowned or burnt to death, their bodies tossed about like pieces of cork within the heart of the scarlet wave. I reached out to them - my people! - and prayed to the gods of the vampires to free me, so that I could die with my blood brothers and sisters. But still I couldn't break through the invisible boundary.</p><p>More vampires vanished beneath the breaking surf of fire and blood, lost to the wave of merciless red. A thousand lives extinguished? fifteen hundred warriors eliminated? two thousand souls sent soaring to Paradise? twenty-five hundred death howls? three thousand corpses, bobbing and burning in the flames.</p><p>And then only I was left. My voice returned, and with a desolate cry I collapsed to my knees and glared hatefully up at the crest of the wave as it teetered overhead. I saw faces within the walls of flaming blood - my friends and allies. The wave was taunting me with them.</p><p>Then I saw something hovering in the air above the wave, a creature of myth but oh so real. A dragon. Long, glittering, scaled, terrifyingly beautiful. And on its back - a person. A figure of pulsating darkness. It was almost as though his body had been created from shadows.</p><p>The shadow man laughed when he saw me, and his laugh was a ghostly cackle, evil and mocking. At his command, the dragon swooped lower, so that it was only a few metres above me. From here I could see its rider's features. His face was a mass of dancing patches of darkness, but when I squinted I recognized him - Steve Leopard.</p><p>\"All must fall to the Lord of the Shadows,\" Steve said softly, and pointed behind me. \"This is my world now.\"</p><p>Turning around, I saw a vast area of wasteland dotted with corpses. Over the dead bodies crawled giant toads, hissing black panthers, grotesque human mutants, and more nightmarish creatures and shapes. Cities burnt in the far distance, and great mushroom clouds of smoke and flames filled the air overhead.</p><p>I faced Steve again and roared a challenge at him. \"Face me on the ground, you monster! Fight me now!\"</p><p>Steve only laughed, then waved an arm at the wave of fire. There was a moment of hushed calm. Then the wave crashed to earth around me and I was swept away, face burning, lungs filling with blood, surrounded by the bodies of the dead. But what terrified me most before I was swallowed by eternal blackness was that I'd snatched one final glimpse of before I died. And this time it wasn't Steve's face I saw - it wasmine .</p><p>Chapter ONE</p><p>My eyes snapped open. I wanted to scream, but there was a hand over my mouth, rough and powerful. Fear gripped me. I lashed out at my attacker. Then my senses returned and I realized it was just Harkat, muffling my screams so that I didn't disturb any of the sleepers in the neighbouring caravans and tents.</p><p>I relaxed and tapped Harkat's hand to show that I was OK. He released me and stepped back, his large green eyes alive with concern. He handed me a mug of water. I drank deeply from it, then wiped a shaking hand across my lips and smiled weakly. \"Did I wake you?\"</p><p>\"I wasn't asleep,\" Harkat said. The grey-skinned Little Person didn't need much sleep and often went two or three nights without dozing. He took the mug from me and set it down. \"It was a bad one this? time. You started screaming five or six? minutes ago, and only stopped now. The same nightmare?\"</p><p>\"Isn't it always?\" I muttered. \"The wasteworld, the wave of fire, the dragon, the? Steve,\" I finished quietly. I'd been haunted by the nightmare for almost two years, screaming myself awake at least a couple of times a week. In all those months I hadn't told Harkat about and that wretched face I always saw at the end of the nightmare. As far as he knew, Steve was the only monster in my dreams - I didn't dare tell him that I was as scared of myself as I was of Steve Leopard.</p><p>I swung my legs out of my hammock and sat up. I could tell by the darkness that it was only three or four in the morning, but I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep any more. The nightmare always left me shaken and wide awake.</p><p>Rubbing the back of my neck, I found myself studying Harkat out of the corner of my eye. Although he wasn't the source of my nightmares, I could trace their origins back to him. The Little Person had been built from the Remains of a corpse. For most of his newlife he hadn't known who he was. Two years ago, Mr Tiny - a man of immense power, with the ability to travel through time - transported us to a barren wasteworld and sent us off on a quest to discover Harkat's previous identity. We fought a variety of wild creatures and twisted monstrosities before finally fishing Harkat's original body out of the Lake of Souls, a holding place for damned spirits.</p><p>Harkat used to be a vampire called Kurda Smahlt. He'd betrayed the vampire clan in a bid to prevent war with our blood cousins, the purple-skinned vampaneze. To make up for his sins, he'd agreed to become Harkat Mulds and travel back into the past to be my guardian.</p><p>I'm Darren Shan, a Vampire Prince. I'm also one of the hunters of the Lord of the Vampaneze - a.k.a. Steve Leopard. Steve was destined to lead the vampaneze to victory over the vampires. If he won, he'd wipe us out entirely. But a few of us - the hunters - had the ability to stop him before he came fully into his powers. If we found and killed him before he matured, the war would be ours. By helping me as Harkat, Kurda hoped to help the clan and prevent their destined destruction at the hands of the vampaneze. In that way he could put right some of the wrongs he'd committed.</p><p>Having learnt the truth about Harkat, we returned to our own world - rather, our owntime . Because what we worked out later was that the wasteworld wasn't an alternative universe or Earth in the past, as we'd first thought - it was Earth in the future. Mr Tiny had given us a glimpse of what was to come if came to power.</p>","<p>Harkat thought the ruined world would only come to pass if the vampaneze won the War of the Scars. But I knew about a prediction which I hadn't shared with anybody else. When the hunt for Steve was finally concluded, there would be one of two possible futures. In one, Steve became and destroyed the world. In the other future, wasme .</p><p>That's why I woke in a cold sweat, to the sound of my own screams, so often. It wasn't just fear of the future, but fear of myself. Would I somehow play a part in creating the barren, twisted world I'd seen in the future? Was I damned to become a monster like Steve, and wreck all that I held dear? It seemed impossible, but the uncertainties gnawed away at me all the same, prompted by the ever-repeating nightmares. I spent the time before dawn chatting with Harkat, small talk, nothing serious. He'd suffered terrible nightmares before finding out the truth about himself, so he knew exactly what I was going through. He knew what to say to calm me down.</p><p>When the sun rose and the Cirque camp started to come to life around us, we made an early start on our day's chores. We'd been with the Cirque Du Freak since returning from our gruelling quest in the wasteworld. We knew nothing about what was happening in the War of the Scars. Harkat wanted to return to Vampire Mountain, or at least make contact with the clan - now that he knew he had once been a vampire, he was more concerned than ever for them. But I held off. I didn't feel the time was right. I had a hunch that we were meant to remain with the Cirque, and that destiny would decide our course as and when it saw fit. Harkat strongly disagreed with me - we'd had some very heated arguments about it - but he reluctantly followed my lead - though I'd sensed recently that his patience was coming to an end.</p><p>We performed a variety of jobs around the camp, helping out wherever we were needed - moving equipment, mending costumes, feeding the Wolf Man. We were handymen. Mr Tall - the owner of the Cirque Du Freak - had offered to find more responsible, permanent positions for us, but we didn't know when we'd have to leave. It was easier to stick to simple tasks and not get too involved in the long-term running of the show. That way we wouldn't be missed too much when the time came to part company with the freakish folk.</p><p>We'd been performing on the outskirts of a large city, in an old, run-down factory. Sometimes we played in a big top which we transported around with us, but Mr Tall always liked to take advantage of local venues whenever possible. This was our fourth and final show in the factory. We'd be moving on in the morning, to pastures new. None of us knew where we'd be going yet - Mr Tall made those decisions and usually didn't tell us until we'd broken camp and were already on the move.</p><p>We put on a typically tight, exciting show that night, built around some of the longest-serving performers - Gertha Teeth, Rhamus Twobellies, Alexander Ribs, Truska the bearded lady, Hans Hands, Evra and Shancus Von. Usually the Vons rounded off the show, treating audiences to one final scare when their snakes slid from the shadows overhead. But Mr Tall had been experimenting with different line-ups recently.</p><p>On stage, Jekkus Flang was juggling knives. Jekkus was one of the Cirque helpers, like Harkat and me, but tonight he'd been billed as a star attraction and was entertaining the crowd with a display of knife tricks. Jekkus was a good juggler, but his act was pretty dull compared to the others. After a few minutes, a man in the front row stood up as Jekkus balanced a long knife on the tip of his nose.</p><p>\"This is rubbish!\" the man shouted, climbing on to the stage. \"This is meant to be a place of magic and wonder - not juggling tricks! I could see stuff like this at any circus.\"</p><p>Jekkus took the knife from his nose and snarled at the intruder. \"Get off the stage, or I'll cut you up into tiny pieces!\"</p><p>\"You don't worry me,\" the man snorted, taking a couple of large paces over to Jekkus, so they were eyeball to eyeball. \"You're wasting our time and money. I want a refund.\"</p><p>\"Insolent scum!\" Jekkus roared, then lashed out with his knife and cut off the man's left arm just below the elbow! The man screamed and grabbed for the falling limb. As he was reaching for his lost forearm, Jekkus struck again and cut off the man's other arm in the same place!</p><p>People in the audience erupted with panic and surged to their feet. The man with the jagged stumps beneath his elbows tottered towards the edge of the stage, desperately waving his half-arms around, face white with apparent shock. But then he stopped - and laughed.</p><p>The people in the front rows heard the laughter and stared up at the stage suspiciously. The man laughed again. This time his laughter carried further, and people all around relaxed and faced the stage. As they watched, tiny hands grew out of the stumps of the man's arms. The hands continued to grow, followed by wrists and forearms. A minute later, the man's arms had returned to their natural length. He flexed his fingers, grinned, and took a bow.</p><p>\"Ladies and gentlemen!\" Mr Tall boomed, appearing suddenly on stage. \"Put your hands together for the fabulous, the amazing, the incredibleCormac Limbs !\"</p><p>Everybody realized they'd been the victims of a practical joke - the man who'd stepped out of the audience was a performer. They clapped and cheered as Cormac sliced off his fingers one by one, each of which grew back quickly. He could cut off any part of his body - though he'd never tried chopping off his head! Then the show finished for real and the crowd poured out, babbling with excitement, wildly discussing the mystical mysteries of the sensational Cirque Du Freak.</p><p>Inside, Harkat and I helped with the tidying up. Everyone involved was vastly experienced, and we could normally clear everything away within half an hour, sometimes less. Mr Tall stood in the shadows while we worked. That was odd - he normally retired to his van after a show - but we took little notice of it. You grew used to oddness when you worked with the Cirque Du Freak!</p><p>As I was stacking several chairs away, to be removed to a truck by other hands, Mr Tall stepped forward. \"A moment, please, Darren,\" he said, removing the tall red hat he wore whenever he went on stage. He took a map out of the hat - the map was much larger than the hat, but I didn't question how he'd fitted it inside - and unrolled it. He held one end of the map in his large left hand and nodded for me to take the other end.</p><p>\"This is where we are now,\" Mr Tall said, pointing to a spot on the map. I studied it curiously, wondering why he was showing me. \"And this is where we will be going next,\" he said, pointing to a town a hundred and sixty kilometres away.</p>","<p>I looked at the name of the town. My breath caught in my throat. For a moment I felt dizzy and a cloud seemed to pass in front of my eyes. Then my expression cleared. \"I see,\" I said softly.</p><p>\"You don't have to come with us,\" Mr Tall said. \"You can take a different route and meet up with us later, if you wish.\"</p><p>I started to think about it, then made a snap gut decision instead. \"That's OK,\" I said. \"I'll come. I want to. It? it'll be interesting.\"</p><p>\"Very well,\" Mr Tall said briskly, taking back the map and rolling it up again. \"We depart in the morning.\"</p><p>With that, Mr Tall slipped away. I felt he didn't approve of my decision, but I couldn't say why, and I didn't devote much thought to it. Instead, I stood by the stacked-up chairs, lost in the past, thinking about all the people I'd known as a child, especially my parents and younger sister. Harkat limped over eventually and waved a grey hand in front of my face, snapping me out of my daze. \"What's wrong?\" he asked, sensing my disquiet.</p><p>\"Nothing,\" I said, with a confused shrug. \"At least, I don't think so. It might even be a good thing. I?\" Sighing, I stared at the ten little scars on my fingertips and muttered without looking up, \"I'm going home.\"</p><p>Chapter TWO</p><p>Alexander Ribs stood, rapped his ribcage with a spoon and opened his mouth. A loud musical note sprang out and all conversation ceased. Facing the boy at the head of the table, Alexander sang, \"He's green, he's lean, snot he's never seen, his name is Shancus - happy birthday!\"</p><p>Everybody cheered. Thirty performers and helpers from the Cirque Du Freak were seated around a huge oval table, celebrating Shancus Von's eighth birthday. It was a chilly April day, and most people were wrapped up warmly. The table was overflowing with cakes, sweets and drinks, and we were digging in happily.</p><p>When Alexander Ribs sat down, Truska - a woman who could grow her beard at will - stood and sung another birthday greeting. \"The only things he fears is his mother's flying ears, his name is Shancus - happy birthday!\"</p><p>Merla snapped one of her ears off when she heard that and flicked it at her son. He ducked and it flew high over his head, then circled back to Merla, who caught and reattached it to the side of her head. Everyone laughed.</p><p>Since Shancus had been named in my honour, I guessed I'd better chip in with a verse of my own. Thinking quickly, I stood, cleared my throat, and chanted, \"He's scaly and he's great, today he has turned eight, his name is Shancus - happy birthday!\"</p><p>\"Thanks, godfather,\" Shancus smirked. I wasn't really his godfather, but he liked to pretend I was - especially when it was his birthday and he was looking for a cool present!</p><p>A few others took turns singing birthday greetings to the snake-boy, then Evra stood and wrapped up the song with, \"Despite the pranks you pull, your mum and I love you, pesky Shancus - happy birthday!\"</p><p>There was lots of applause, then the women at the table shuffled over to hug and kiss Shancus. He pulled a mortified expression, but I could see he was delighted by the attention. His younger brother, Urcha, was jealous and sat a little way back from the table, sulking. Their sister, Lilia, was rooting through the piles of presents Shancus had received, seeing if there was anything of interest to a five-year-old girl.</p><p>Evra went to try and cheer up Urcha. Unlike Shancus and Lilia, the middle Von child was an ordinary human and he felt he was the odd one out. Evra and Merla had a tough time making him feel special. I saw Evra slip a small present to Urcha, and heard him whisper, \"Don't tell the others!\" Urcha looked much happier after that. He joined Shancus at the table and tucked into a pile of small cakes.</p><p>I made my way over to where Evra was beaming at his family. \"Eight years,\" I remarked, clapping Evra on his left shoulder (some of his scales had been sliced away from his right shoulder a long time ago, and he didn't like people touching him there). \"I bet it feels like eight weeks.\"</p><p>\"You don't know how right you are,\" Evra smiled. \"Time flies when you have kids. You'll find out yourself one?\" He stopped and grimaced. \"Sorry. I forgot.\"</p><p>\"Don't worry about it,\" I said. As a half-vampire, I was sterile. I could never have children. It was one of the drawbacks to being part of the clan.</p><p>\"When are you going to show the snake to Shancus?\" Evra asked.</p><p>\"Later,\" I grinned. \"I gave him a book earlier. He thinks that's his real present - he looked disgusted! I'll let him enjoy the rest of the party, then hit him with the snake when he thinks the fun is over.\"</p><p>Shancus already owned a snake, but I'd bought a new one for him, larger and more colourful. Evra helped me choose it. His old snake would be passed on to Urcha, so both boys would have cause to celebrate tonight.</p><p>Merla called Evra back to the party - Lilia had got stuck in wrapping paper and needed to be rescued. I watched my friends for a minute or two, then turned my back on the festivities and walked away. I wandered through the maze of vans and tents of the Cirque Du Freak, coming to a halt near the Wolf Man's cage. The savage man-beast was snoring. I took a small jar of pickled onions out of my pocket and ate one, smiling sadly as I remembered where my taste for pickled onions had come from.</p><p>That memory led to others, and I found myself looking back over the years, recalling major events, remarkable triumphs, and sickening losses. The night of my blooding, when Mr Crepsley pumped his vampiric blood into me. Slowly coming to terms with my appetite and powers. Sam Grest - the original pickled onion connoisseur. My first girlfriend, Debbie Hemlock. Learning about the vampaneze. The trek to Vampire Mountain. My Trials, where I'd had to prove myself worthy of being a child of the night. Failing and running away. The revelation that a Vampire General - Kurda Smahlt - was a traitor, in league with the vampaneze. Exposing Kurda. Becoming a Prince.</p><p>The Wolf Man stirred and I walked on, not wanting to wake him. My mind continued to turn over old memories. Kurda telling us why he'd betrayed the clan - the Lord of the Vampaneze had arisen and stood poised to lead his people into war against the vampires. The early years of the War of the Scars, when I'd lived in Vampire Mountain. Leaving the safety of the fortress to hunt for the Vampaneze Lord, accompanied by Mr Crepsley and Harkat. Meeting Vancha March, the third hunter - only he, Mr Crepsley or I could kill the Vampaneze Lord. Travelling with a witch called Evanna. Clashing with the Lord of the Vampaneze, unaware of his identity until afterwards, when he'd escaped with his protector, Gannen Harst.</p>","<p>I wanted to stop there - the next set of memories was the most painful - but my thoughts raced on. Returning to the city of Mr Crepsley's youth. Running into Debbie again - an adult now, a teacher. Other faces from the past - R.V. and Steve Leopard. The former used to be an eco-warrior, a man who blamed me for the loss of his hands. He'd become a vampaneze and was part of a plot to lure my allies and me underground, where the Lord of the Vampaneze could kill us.</p><p>Steve was part of that plot too, though at first I thought he was on our side. Steve was my best friend when we were kids. We went to the Cirque Du Freak together. He recognized Mr Crepsley and asked to be his assistant. Mr Crepsley refused - he said Steve had evil blood. Later, Steve was bitten by Mr Crepsley's poisonous tarantula. Only Mr Crepsley could cure him. I became a half-vampire to save Steve's life, but Steve didn't see it that way. He thought I'd betrayed him and taken his place among the vampires. He became hell-bent on revenge.</p><p>Underground in Mr Crepsley's city. Facing the vampaneze in a chamber Steve had named the Cavern of Retribution. Me, Mr Crepsley, Vancha, Harkat, Debbie and a police officer called Alice Burgess. A huge fight. Mr Crepsley faced the man we thought was the Lord of the Vampaneze. He killed him. But then Steve killed Mr Crepsley by knocking him into a pit of stakes. A gut-churning blow, made all the worse when Steve revealed the shocking truth ?he was the real Lord of the Vampaneze!</p><p>I reached the last of the tents and stopped, gazing around, half-dazed. We'd set up camp in an abandoned football stadium. It used to be the home ground of the local football team, but they'd moved to a new, purpose-built stadium some years ago. The old stadium was due to be demolished - apartment blocks were to be built over the ruins - but not for several months yet. It was an eerie feeling, staring around at thousands of empty seats in the ghost stadium.</p><p>Ghosts? That put me in mind of my next, bizarre quest with Harkat, in what we now knew was a shade of the future. Once again I began to wonder if that ruined future world was unavoidable. Could I prevent it by killing Steve, or was it destined to come no matter who won the War of the Scars?</p><p>Before I got too worked up about it, someone stepped up beside me and said, \"Is the party over?\"</p><p>I looked around and saw the scarred, stitched-together, grey-skinned face of Harkat Mulds. \"No,\" I smiled. \"It's winding down, but it hasn't finished yet.\"</p><p>\"Good. I was afraid I'd miss it.\" Harkat had been out on the streets most of the day, handing out fliers for the Cirque Du Freak - that was one of his regular jobs every time we arrived at a new venue. He stared at me with his round, green, lidless eyes. \"How do you feel?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Strange. Worried. Unsure of myself.\"</p><p>\"Have you been out there yet?\" Harkat waved a hand at the town beyond the walls of the stadium. I shook my head. \"Are you going to go, or do you plan? to hide here until we leave?\"</p><p>\"I'll go,\" I said. \"But it's hard. So many years. So many memories.\" This was the real reason I was so fixed on the past. After all these years of travel, I'd returned home to the town where I was born and had lived all my human life.</p><p>\"What if my family's still here?\" I asked Harkat.</p><p>\"Your parents?\" he replied.</p><p>\"And Annie, my sister. They think I'm dead. What if they see me?\"</p><p>\"Would they recognize you?\" Harkat asked. \"It's been a long time. People change.\"</p><p>\"Humans do,\" I snorted. \"But I've only aged four or five years.\"</p><p>\"Maybe it wouldn't be a bad thing to? see them again,\" Harkat said. \"Imagine their joy if they learnt that? you were still alive.\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said forcefully. \"I've been thinking about that ever since Mr Tall told me we were coming here. Iwant to track them down. It would be wonderful for me - but terrible for them. They buried me. They've done their grieving and have hopefully moved on with their lives. It wouldn't be fair to bring back all those old pains and torments.\"</p><p>\"I'm not sure I agree with that,\" Harkat said, \"but it's? your decision. So stay here with the Cirque. Lay low. Hide.\"</p><p>\"I can't,\" I sighed. \"This is my home town. I've got an itch to walk the streets again, see how much has changed, look for old faces that I used to know. I want to find out what happened to my friends. The wise thing would be to keep my head down - but when didI ever do the wise thing?\"</p><p>\"And maybe trouble would find you? even if you did,\" Harkat said.</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I frowned.</p><p>Harkat glanced around uneasily. \"I have a strange feeling about? this place,\" he croaked.</p><p>\"What sort of a feeling?\" I asked.</p><p>\"It's hard to explain. Just a feeling that this is? a dangerous place, but also the place where? we're meant to be. Something's going to happen here. Don't you sense it?\"</p><p>\"No - but my thoughts are all overthe place right now.\"</p><p>\"We've often discussed your decision to? stay with the Cirque,\" Harkat reminded me, making little of the many arguments we'd had about whether or not I should leave and seek out the Vampire Generals. He believed I was hiding from my duty, that we should seek out the vampires and resume the hunt for the Vampaneze Lord.</p><p>\"You're not starting that again, are you?\" I groaned.</p><p>\"No,\" he said. \"The opposite. I now think you were right. If we hadn't stuck with the Cirque? we wouldn't be here now. And, as I said, I think we're? meant to be here.\"</p><p>I studied Harkat silently. \"What do you think will happen?\" I asked quietly.</p><p>\"The feeling isn't that specific,\" Harkat said.</p><p>\"But if you had to guess?\" I pressed.</p><p>Harkat shrugged awkwardly. \"I think we might run into? Steve Leonard, or find a clue which? points towards him.\"</p><p>My insides tightened at the thought of facing Steve again. I hated him for what he'd done to us, especially killing Mr Crepsley. But just before he died, Mr Crepsley warned me not to devote my life to hatred. He said it would twist me like Steve. So although I hungered for the chance to get even, I worried about it too. I didn't know how I'd react when I saw him again, whether I'd be able to control my emotions or give in to blind, hateful rage.</p><p>\"You're frightened,\" Harkat noted.</p><p>\"Yes. But not of Steve. I'm frightened of whatI might do.\"</p>","<p>\"Don't worry,\" Harkat smiled. \"You'll be OK.\"</p><p>\"What if?\" I hesitated, afraid I'd jinx myself. But that was silly, so I came out with it. \"Whatif Steve tries to use my family against me? What if he threatens my parents or Annie?\"</p><p>Harkat nodded slowly. \"I thought of that already. It's the sort of sick stunt I can? imagine him pulling.\"</p><p>\"What will I do if he does?\" I asked. \"He already sucked Debbie into his insane plot to destroy me - not to mention R.V. What if?\"</p><p>\"Easy,\" Harkat soothed me. \"The first thing is to find out if? they still live here. If they do, we can arrange protection? for them. We'll establish a watch around their house? and guard them.\"</p><p>\"The two of us can't protect them by ourselves,\" I grunted.</p><p>\"But we're not by ourselves,\" Harkat said. \"We have many friends in? the Cirque. They'll help.\"</p><p>\"You think it's fair to involve them?\" I asked.</p><p>\"They may already be involved,\" Harkat said. \"Their destinies are tied to ours, I think. That may be another reason why you felt? you had to stay here.\" Then he smiled. \"Come on - I want to get to the party before? Rhamus scoffs all the cakes!\"</p><p>Laughing, I put my fears behind me for a while and walked back through the campsite with Harkat. But if I'd known just how closely the destinies of my freakish friends were connected with mine, and the anguish I was steering them towards, I'd have about-faced and immediately fled to the other end of the world.</p><p>Chapter THREE</p><p>I didn't go exploring that day. I stayed at the Cirque Du Freak and celebrated Shancus's birthday. He loved his new snake, and I thought Urcha was going to float away with joy when he found out Shancus's old snake was to be his. The party went on longer than expected. The table was loaded up with more cakes and buns, and not even the ever-hungry Rhamus Twobellies could finish them off. Afterwards we prepared for that night's show, which went ahead smoothly. I spent most of the show in the wings, studying faces in the audience, looking for old neighbours and friends. But I didn't see anybody I recognized.</p><p>The next morning, while most of the Cirque folk were sleeping, I slipped out. Although it was a bright day, I wore a light anorak over my clothes, so I could pull the hood up and mask my face if I had to.</p><p>I walked rapidly, thrilled to be back. The streets had changed a lot - new shops and offices, many redecorated or redesigned buildings - but the names were the same. I ran into memories on every block. The shop where I bought my football boots. Mum's favourite clothes boutique. The cinema where we'd taken Annie to her first film. The newsagent where I shopped for comics.</p><p>I wandered through a vast complex which used to be my favourite computer arcade. It was under new ownership and had grown beyond recognition. I tried out some of the games, and smiled as I remembered how excited I'd get when I'd come here on a Saturday and blast away a few hours on the latest shoot-'em-up.</p><p>Moving away from the central shopping area, I visited my favourite parks. One was now a housing estate but the other was unchanged. I saw a groundsman tending to a bed of flowers - old William Morris, my friend Alan's grandfather. William was the first person from the past I'd seen. He hadn't known me very well, so I was able to walk right past him and study him up-close without fear of being spotted.</p><p>I wanted to stop and chat with Alan's grandfather, and ask for news about Alan. I was going to tell him that I was one of Alan's friends, that I'd lost touch with him. But then I remembered that Alan was now an adult, not a teenager like me. So I walked on, silent, unobserved.</p><p>I was anxious to check out my old house. But I didn't feel ready - I trembled with nerves every time I thought about it. So I wandered through the centre of town, past banks, shops, restaurants. I caught glimpses of half-remembered faces - clerks and waiters, a few customers - but nobody I'd known personally.</p><p>I had a bite to eat in a cafe. The food wasn't especially good, but it had been Dad's favourite place - he often brought me here for a snack while Mum and Annie were doing damage in the shops. It was nice to sit in the familiar surroundings and order a chicken and bacon sandwich, like in the old days.</p><p>After lunch, I strolled past my original school - a really eerie feeling! A new wing had been added, and there were iron railings around the perimeter, but apart from that it looked just the way I remembered. Lunch break was ending. I watched from underneath the shadows of a tree while the students filed back into class. I saw some teachers too. Most were new, but two caught my attention. One was Mrs McDaid. She'd taught languages, mostly to older students. I'd had her for half a term when my regular teacher was on a leave of absence.</p><p>I'd been much closer to the other teacher - Mr Dalton! I'd had him for English and history. He'd been my favourite teacher. He was chatting with some of his students as he entered class after lunch, and by their smiles I saw he was still as popular as ever.</p><p>It would have been great to catch up with Mr Dalton. I was seriously thinking about waiting for school to finish, then going to see him. He'd know what had happened to my parents and Annie. I needn't tell him I was a vampire - I could say I had an anti-ageing disease, which kept me looking young. Explaining away my \"death\" would be tricky, but I could cook up some suitable story.</p><p>One thing held me back. A few years ago, in Mr Crepsley's home city, I'd been branded a killer by the police, and my name and photo had been flashed all over the TV and newspapers. What if Mr Dalton had heard about that? If he knew I was alive, and thought I was a murderer, he might alert the authorities. Safer not to take the risk. So I turned my back on the school and slowly walked away.</p><p>It was only then that it struck me that Mr Dalton wouldn't be the only one who might have picked up on the \"Darren Shan - serial killer!\" hysteria. What if my parents had heard about it! Mr Crepsley's city was in a different part of the world, and I wasn't sure how much news travelled between the two countries. But it was a possibility.</p><p>I had to sit down on a street bench while I considered that horrific potential. I could only begin to imagine how shocking it would have been if, years after they'd buried me, Mum and Dad had spotted me on the news, under a caption branding me a killer. How had I never thought about it before?</p><p>This could be a real problem. As I'd told Harkat, I didn't intend going to see my family - too painful for everyone. But if they already knew I was alive, and were living with the misbelief that I was a killer, I'd have to set the record straight. But what if theydidn't know?</p>","<p>I had to do some research. I'd passed a brand new, ultra-modern library earlier that morning. Hurrying back to it, I asked a librarian for assistance. I said I was doing a school project and had to pick some local story from the last three years to write about. I asked to examine all the issues of the main local paper, as well as the national paper which my mum and dad used to read. I figured, if word of my exploits in Mr Crepsley's city had spread this far, there'd be a mention of me in one of those two papers.</p><p>The librarian was happy to help. She showed me where the microfiche were stored, and how to use them. Once I'd got the knack of getting them up on screen and scanning from one page to the next, she left me to my own devices.</p><p>I started with the earliest editions of the national paper, from a few months before I ran into trouble with the law. I was looking for any mention of Mr Crepsley's city and the killers plaguing it. I made quick time, glancing only at the international sections. I found a couple of references to the murders - and they were both mocking! Apparently journalists here were amused by the vampire rumours which had swept the city, and the story was treated as light entertainment. There was a short piece in one issue, relaying the news that the police had caught four suspects, and then carelessly let all four escape. No names, and no mention of the people Steve had killed when he broke out.</p><p>I was relieved but angered at the same time. I knew the pain the vampaneze had brought to that city, the lives they'd destroyed. It wasn't right that such a grim story should be turned into the stuff of funny urban legends, simply because it happened in a city far away from where these people lived. They wouldn't have found it so amusing if the vampaneze had struck here!</p><p>I made a quick check on issues from the next few months, but the paper had dropped the story after news of the escape. I turned to the local paper. This was slower going. The main news was at the front, but local interest stories were scattered throughout. I had to check most of the pages of each edition before I could move on to the next.</p><p>Although I tried not to dwell on articles unrelated to me, I couldn't stop myself from skimming the opening paragraphs of the more interesting stones. It wasn't long before I was catching up with all the news - elections, scandals, heroes, villains; policemen who'd been highly commended, criminals who'd given the town a bad name; a big bank raid; coming third in a national tidy towns competition.</p><p>I saw photographs and read clips about several of my school friends, but one in particular stood out - Tom Jones! Tommy was one of my best friends, along with Steve and Alan Morris. We were two of the best footballers in our class. I was the goal-scorer, leading the line up front, while Tommy was the goal-stopper, pulling off spectacular saves. I'd often dreamt of going on to be a professional footballer. Tommy had taken that dream all the way and become a goalkeeper.</p><p>There were dozens of photos and stones about him. Tom Jones (he'd shortened the \"Tommy\") was one of the best keepers in the country. Lots of articles poked fun at his name - there was also a famous singer called Tom Jones - but nobody had anything bad to say about Tommy himself. After working his way up through the amateur ranks, he'd signed for a local team, made a name for himself, then played abroad for five years. Now he was back home, part of the best team in the country. In the most recent editions, I read how local football fans were buzzing with excitement at the prospect of this years cup semi-final - it was being held in our town, and Tommy's team was in it. Of course, they'd have been a lot happier if their own team had qualified, but this was the next best thing.</p><p>Reading about Tommy brought a smile to my face - it was great to see one of my friends doing so well. The other good news was that there was no mention of me. Since this was quite a small town, I was sure word would have spread if anyone had heard about me in connection with the killings. I was in the clear.</p><p>But there was no mention of my family in the papers either. I couldn't find the name \"Shan\" anywhere. There was only one thing for it - I'd have to dig around for information in person by going back to the house where I used to live.</p><p>Chapter FOUR</p><p>The house took my breath away. It hadn't changed. Same colour door, same style curtains, same small garden out the back. As I stood gazing at it, gripping the top of the fence, I almost expected a younger version of myself to come bounding out the back door, clutching a pile of comics, on his way over to Steve's.</p><p>\"May I help you?\" someone asked behind me.</p><p>My head snapped round and my eyes cleared. I didn't know how long I'd been standing there, but by my white knuckles, I guessed it had been a few minutes at least. An elderly woman was standing close by, studying me suspiciously. Rubbing my hands together, I smiled warmly. \"Just looking,\" I said.</p><p>\"At what, precisely?\" she challenged me, and I realized how I must appear to her - a rough-faced teenager, gazing intently into a deserted back yard, checking out the house. She thought I was a burglar casing the joint!</p><p>\"My name's Derek Shan,\" I said, borrowing an uncle's first name. \"My cousins lived here. In fact, they still might. I'm not sure. I'm in town to see some friends, and I thought I'd pop over and find out if my relatives were here or not.\"</p><p>\"You're related to Annie?\" the woman asked, and I shivered at the mention of the name.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said, fighting hard to keep my voice steady. \"And Dermot and Angela.\" My parents. \"Do they still live here?\"</p><p>\"Dermot and Angela moved away three or four years ago,\" the woman said. She stepped up beside me, at ease now, and squinted at the house. \"They should have left sooner. That was never a happy house, not since their boy died.\" The woman looked sideways at me. \"You know about that?\"</p><p>\"I remember my dad saying something,\" I muttered, ears turning red.</p><p>\"I wasn't living here then,\" the woman said. \"But I've heard all about it. He fell out of a window. The family stayed on, but it was a miserable place after that. I don't know why they stuck around so long. You can't enjoy yourself in a house of bitter memories.\"</p><p>\"But they did stay,\" I said, \"until three or four years ago? And then moved on?\"</p><p>\"Yes. Dermot had a mild heart attack. He had to retire early.\"</p><p>\"Heart attack!\" I gasped. \"Is he OK?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" The woman smiled at me. \"I said it was mild, didn't I? But they decided to move when he retired. Left for the coast. Angela often said she'd like to live by the sea.\"</p>","<p>\"What about Annie?\" I asked. \"Did she go with them?\"</p><p>\"No. Annie stayed. She still lives here - her and her boy.\"</p><p>\"Boy?\" I blinked.</p><p>\"Her son.\" The woman frowned. \"Are you sure you're a relative? You don't seem to know much about your own family.\"</p><p>\"I've lived abroad most of my life,\" I said truthfully.</p><p>\"Oh.\" The woman lowered her voice. \"Actually, I suppose it's not the sort of thing you talk about in front of children. What age are you, Derek?\"</p><p>\"Sixteen,\" I lied.</p><p>\"Then I guess you're old enough. My name's Bridget, by the way.\"</p><p>\"Hello, Bridget.\" I forced a smile, silently willing her to get on with the story.</p><p>\"The boy's a nice enough child, but he's not really a Shan.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I frowned.</p><p>\"He was born out of wedlock. Annie never married. I'm not even sure anyone except her knows who the father is. Angela claimed they knew, but she never told us his name.\"</p><p>\"I guess lots of women choose not to marry these days,\" I sniffed, not liking the way Bridget was talking about Annie.</p><p>\"True,\" Bridget nodded. \"Nothing wrong with wanting the child but not the husband. But Annie was on the young side. She was just sweet sixteen when the baby was born.\"</p><p>Bridget was glowing, the way gossips do when they're telling a juicy story. I wanted to snap at her, but it was better to hold my tongue.</p><p>\"Dermot and Angela helped rear the baby,\" Bridget continued. \"He was a blessing in some ways. He became a replacement for their lost son. He brought some joy back into the house.\"</p><p>\"And now Annie looks after him by herself?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Yes. Angela came back a lot during the first year, for weekends and holidays. But now the boy's more independent, Annie can cope by herself. They get along as well as most, I guess.\" Bridget glanced at the house and sniffed. \"But they could do with giving that old wreck a slap of paint.\"</p><p>\"I think the house looks fine,\" I said stiffly.</p><p>\"What do sixteen-year-old boys know about houses?\" Bridget laughed. Then she bid me good day and went about her business. I was going to call her back, to ask when Annie would be home. But then I decided not to. Just as easy - and more exciting - to wait out here and watch for her.</p><p>There was a small tree on the other side of the road. I stood by it, hood up over my head, checking my watch every few minutes as though I was waiting to meet somebody. The street was quiet and not many people passed.</p><p>The day darkened and dusk set upon the town. There was a bite in the air but it didn't trouble me - half-vampires don't feel the cold as much as humans. I thought about what Bridget had said while I was waiting. Annie, a mother! Hard to believe. She'd been a kid herself the last time I saw her. From what Bridget said, Annie's life hadn't been the easiest. Being a mother at sixteen must have been rough. But it sounded like she had things under control now.</p><p>A light went on in the kitchen. A woman's silhouette passed from one side to the other. Then the back door opened and my sister stepped out. There was no mistaking her. Taller, with long brown hair, much plumper than she'd been as a girl. But the same face. The same sparkling eyes, and lips which were ready to turn up into a warm-hearted smile at a moment's notice.</p><p>I stared at Annie as though in a trance. I wasn't able to tear my eyes away. I was trembling, and my legs felt like they were about to give way, but I couldn't turn my gaze aside.</p><p>Annie walked to a small washing line in the back yard, from which a boy's clothes were hanging. She blew into her hands to warm them, then reached up and took the clothes down, one garment at a time, folding each over the crook of her left arm.</p><p>I stepped forward and opened my mouth to call her name, all thoughts of not announcing myself forgotten. This was Annie - my sister! Ihad to talk to her, hold her again, laugh and cry with her, catch up on the past, ask about Mum and Dad.</p><p>But my vocal chords wouldn't work. I was choked up with emotion. All I managed was a thin croak. Closing my mouth, I walked across the road, slowing as I came to the fence. Annie had gathered all the clothes from the line and was returning to the kitchen. I gulped deeply and licked my lips. Blinked several times in quick succession to clear my head. Opened my mouth again?</p><p>?and stopped when a boy inside the house shouted, \"Mum! I'm home!\"</p><p>\"About time!\" Annie yelled in reply, and I could hear the love in her voice. \"I thought I told you to bring in the clothes.\"</p><p>\"Sorry. Wait a sec?\" I saw the boy's shadow as he entered the kitchen and hurried over to the back door. Then he emerged, a chubby boy, fair-haired, very pleasant looking.</p><p>\"Do you want me to take some of those?\" the boy said.</p><p>\"My hero,\" Annie laughed, handing half of the load over to the boy. He went in ahead of her. She turned to shut the door and caught a glimpse of me. She paused. It was quite dark. The light was behind her. She couldn't see me very well. But if I stood there long enough? if I called out to her?</p><p>I didn't.</p><p>Instead I coughed, pulled my hood tight around my face, spun and walked away. I heard the door close behind me, and it was like the sound of a sharp blade slicing me adrift from the past.</p><p>Annie had her own life. A son. A home. Probably a job. Maybe a boyfriend or somebody special. It wouldn't be fair if I popped up, opening old wounds, making her part of my dark, twisted world. She enjoyed peace and a normal life - much better than what I had to offer.</p><p>So I left her behind and slunk away quickly, through the streets of my old town, back to my real home - the Cirque Du Freak. And I sobbed my heart out every painful, lonely step of the way.</p><p>Chapter FIVE</p><p>I couldn't bear to talk to anybody that night. I sat by myself in a seat high up in the football stadium while the show was in progress, thinking about Annie and her child, Mum and Dad, all that I'd lost and missed out on. For the first time in years I felt angry with Mr Crepsley for blooding me. I found myself wondering what life would be like if he'd left me alone, wishing I could go back and change the past.</p><p>But there was no point tormenting myself. The past was a closed book. I could do nothing to alter it, and wasn't even sure I would if I could - if I hadn't been blooded, I wouldn't have been able to tip the vampires off about Kurda Smahlt, and the entire clan might have fallen.</p>","<p>If I'd returned home ten or twelve years earlier, my feelings of loss and anger might have been stronger. But I was an adult now, in all but looks. A Vampire Prince. I'd learnt to deal with heartache. That wasn't an easy night. Tears flowed freely. But by the time I drifted off to sleep a few hours before dawn, I'd resigned myself to the situation, and knew there would be no fresh tears in the morning.</p><p>I was stiff with the cold when I awoke, but worked it off by jogging down the tiers of the stadium to where the Cirque was camped. As I was making for the tent I shared with Harkat, I spotted Mr Tall. He was standing by an open fire, roasting sausages on a spit. He beckoned me over and threw a handful of sausages to me, then speared a fresh batch and stuck them over the flames.</p><p>\"Thanks,\" I said, eagerly munching the piping-hot sausages.</p><p>\"I knew you would be hungry,\" he replied. He looked at me steadily. \"You have been to see your sister.\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" It didn't surprise me that he knew. Mr Tall was an insightful old owl.</p><p>\"Did she see you?\" Mr Tall asked.</p><p>\"She saw me briefly, but I left before she got a good look.\"</p><p>\"You behaved correctly.\" He turned the sausages over and spoke softly. \"You are about to ask me if I will help protect your sister. You fear for her safety.\"</p><p>\"Harkat thinks something's going to happen,\" I said. \"He's not sure what, but if Steve Leopard's part of it, he might use Annie to hurt me.\"</p><p>\"He won't,\" Mr Tall said. I was surprised by his directness - normally he was very cagey when it came to revealing anything about the future. \"As long as you stay out of her life, your sister will be under no direct threat.\"</p><p>\"What aboutin direct threat?\" I asked warily.</p><p>Mr Tall chuckled. \"We are all under indirect threat, one way or another. Harkat is correct - this is a time and place of destiny. I can say no more about it, except leave your sister alone. She is safe that way.\"</p><p>\"OK,\" I sighed. I wasn't happy about leaving Annie to fend for herself, but I trusted Hibernius Tall.</p><p>\"You should sleep some more now,\" Mr Tall said. \"You are tired.\"</p><p>That sounded like a good plan. I scoffed another sausage, turned to leave, then stopped. \"Hibernius,\" I said without facing him, \"I know you can't tell me what's going to happen, but before we came here, you said I didn't have to come. It would have been better if I'd stayed away, wouldn't it?\"</p><p>There was a long silence. I didn't think he was going to respond. But then, softly, he said, \"Yes.\"</p><p>\"What if I left now?\"</p><p>\"It is too late,\" Mr Tall said. \"Your decision to return set a train of events in motion. That train cannot be derailed. If you left now, it would only serve the purpose of the forces you oppose.\"</p><p>\"But what if?\" I said, turning to push the issue. But Mr Tall had disappeared, leaving only the flickering flames and a stick speared with sausages lying on the grass next to the fire.</p><p>That evening, after I'd rested and enjoyed a filling meal, I told Harkat about my trip home. I also told him about my short conversation with Mr Tall and how he'd urged me not to get involved with Annie.</p><p>\"Then you were right,\" Harkat grunted. \"I thought you should involve yourself with? your family again, but it seems I was wrong.\"</p><p>We were feeding scraps of meat to the Wolf Man, part of our daily chores. We stood at a safe distance from his cage, all too aware of the power of his fearsome jaws.</p><p>\"What about your nephew?\" Harkat asked. \"Any family resemblance?\"</p><p>I paused, a large sliver of meat in my right hand. \"It's strange, but I didn't think of him as that until now. I just thought of him as Annie's son. I forgot that also makes him my nephew.\" I grinned crookedly. \"I'm an uncle!\"</p><p>\"Congratulations,\" Harkat deadpanned. \"Did he look like you?\"</p><p>\"Not really,\" I said. I thought of the fair-haired, chubby boy's smile, and how he'd helped Annie bring in the washing. \"A nice kid, from what I saw. Handsome, of course, like all the Shans.\"</p><p>\"Of course!\" Harkat snorted.</p><p>I was sorry I hadn't taken more notice of Annie's boy. I didn't even know his name. I thought about going back to ask about him - I could hang about and collar Bridget the gossip again - but dismissed the idea immediately. That was precisely the kind of stunt which could backfire and bring me to Annie's notice. Best to forget about him.</p><p>As we were finishing off, I saw a young boy watching us from behind a nearby van. He was studying us quietly, taking care not to attract attention. In the normal run of things, I'd have ignored him - children often came nosing around the Cirque site. But my thoughts were on my nephew and I found myself more interested in the boy than I'd otherwise have been.</p><p>\"Hello!\" I shouted, waving at him. The boy's head instantly vanished behind the van. I would have left it, but moments later the boy stepped out and walked towards us. He looked nervous - understandable, since we were in the presence of the snarling Wolf Man - but he was fighting hard not to show it.</p><p>The boy stopped a few metres away and nodded curtly. \"Hello,\" he mumbled. He was scrawny. He had dark blond hair and bright blue eyes. I put his age at somewhere in the region of ten or eleven, maybe a little bit older than Annie's kid, though there couldn't have been much of an age difference. For all I knew they might even be going to school together!</p><p>The boy said nothing after greeting us. I was thinking about my nephew and comparing this boy to him, so I said nothing either. Harkat finally broke the silence. \"Hi,\" he said, lowering the mask he wore to filter out air, which was poisonous to him. \"I'm Harkat.\"</p><p>\"Darius,\" the boy said, nodding at Harkat, not offering to shake hands.</p><p>\"And I'm Darren,\" I smiled.</p><p>\"You two are with the freak show,\" Darius said. \"I saw you yesterday.\"</p><p>\"You've been here before?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"A couple of times. I've never seen a freak show before. I tried buying a ticket but nobody will sell me one. I asked the tall guy - he's the owner, isn't he? - but he said it wasn't suitable for children.\"</p><p>\"It is a bit on the gruesome side,\" I said.</p><p>\"That's why I want to see it,\" he grunted.</p><p>I laughed, remembering what I'd been like at his age. \"Tell you what,\" I said. \"Why don't you walk around with us? We can show you some of the performers and tell you about the show. If you still want a ticket, maybe we can sort one out for you then.\"</p>","<p>Darius squinted at me suspiciously, then at Harkat. \"How do I know I can trust you?\" he asked. \"You might be a pair of kidnappers.\"</p><p>\"Oh, you have my word we won't? kidnap you,\" Harkat purred, treating Darius to his widest grin, displaying his grey tongue and sharp, pointed teeth. \"We might feed you to the Wolf Man? but we won't kidnap you.\"</p><p>Darius yawned to show he wasn't impressed by the theatrical threat, then said, \"What the hell, I've nothing better to do.\" Then he tapped his foot and raised an eyebrow impatiently. \"Come on!\" he snapped. \"I'm ready!\"</p><p>\"Yes, master,\" I laughed, and led the harmless-looking boy on a tour of the Cirque.</p><p>Chapter SIX</p><p>We walked Darius around the site and introduced him to Rhamus Twobellies, Cormac Limbs, Hans Hands and Truska. Cormac was busy and didn't have time to show the boy how he could re-grow his limbs, but Truska sprouted a short beard for him, then sucked the hairs back into her face. Darius acted like he wasn't impressed, but I could see the wonder in his eyes.</p><p>Darius was strange. He didn't say much, and kept his distance, always a couple of metres away from Harkat and me, as though he still didn't trust us. He asked lots of questions about the performers and the Cirque Du Freak, which was normal. But he didn't ask anything about me, where I was from, how I'd come to join the show or what my tasks involved. He didn't ask about Harkat either. The grey-skinned, stitched-together Little Person was like nothing most people had ever seen. It was common for newcomers to pump him for information. But Darius seemed uninterested in Harkat, as if he already knew everything about him.</p><p>He also had a way of staring at me oddly. I'd catch him looking at me, when he thought my attention was elsewhere. It wasn't a threatening look. There was just something about the flickering of his eyes that for some reason unsettled me.</p><p>Harkat and I weren't hungry, but when we passed one of the open campfires and saw a pot of bubbling soup, I heard Darius's stomach rumble. \"Want to eat?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I'm having dinner when I go home,\" he said.</p><p>\"How about a snack, to keep you going?\"</p><p>He hesitated, then licked his lips and nodded quickly. \"But just a small bowl of soup,\" he snapped, as though we meant to force-feed him.</p><p>While Darius was downing the soup, Harkat asked if he lived nearby.</p><p>\"Not far off,\" he answered vaguely.</p><p>\"How did you find out? about the show?\"</p><p>Darius didn't look up. \"A friend of mine - Oggy Bas - was here. He was going to take some seats - we often come here when we want seats or railings. It's easy to get in and nobody cares what we take. He saw the circus tent and told me. I thought it was an ordinary circus until I came exploring yesterday.\"</p><p>\"What sort of a name is Oggy Bas?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Oggy's short for Augustine,\" Darius explained.</p><p>\"Did you tell Oggy what the Cirque Du? Freak really was?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"Nah,\" Darius said. \"He's got a big mouth. He'd tell everybody and they'd all come. I like being the only one who knows about it.\"</p><p>\"So you're a boy who knows how to keep a secret,\" I chuckled. \"Of course, the downside is that since nobody knows you're here, if wedid kidnap you or feed you to the Wolf Man, nobody would know where to look.\"</p><p>I was joking, but Darius reacted sharply. He half-bolted to his feet, dropping the unfinished bowl of soup. Acting instinctively, I snatched for the bowl, and with my vampire speed I caught it before it hit the ground. But Darius thought I meant to strike him. He threw himself backwards and roared, \"Leave me alone!\"</p><p>I took a surprised step back. The other people around the fire were gawping at us. Harkat's green eyes were on Darius, and there was more than just surprise in his expression - he looked wary too.</p><p>\"Easy,\" I half-laughed, lowering the bowl, then raising my hands in a gesture of friendship. \"I'm not going to hurt you.\"</p><p>Darius sat up. He was blushing angrily. \"I'm OK,\" he mumbled, getting to his feet.</p><p>\"What's wrong, Darius?\" Harkat asked quietly. \"Why so edgy?\"</p><p>\"I'm OK,\" Darius said again, glaring at Harkat. \"I just don't like people saying stuff like that. It's not funny, creatures like you making threats like that.\"</p><p>\"I didn't mean it,\" I said, ashamed for having frightened the boy. \"How about I get a ticket to tonight's show for you, to make up for scaring you?\"</p><p>\"I ain't scared,\" Darius growled.</p><p>\"Of course you aren't,\" I smiled. \"But would you like a ticket anyway?\"</p><p>Darius pulled a face. \"How much are they?\"</p><p>\"It's free,\" I said. \"Courtesy of the house.\"</p><p>\"OK then.\" That was as close as Darius got to saying thanks.</p><p>\"Would you like one for Oggy too?\" I asked.</p><p>\"No,\" Darius said. \"He wouldn't come. He's a scaredy cat. He doesn't even watch horror movies, not even the really old and boring ones.\"</p><p>\"Fair enough,\" I said. \"Wait here. I'll be back in a couple of minutes.\"</p><p>I tracked down Mr Tall. When I told him what I wanted, he frowned and said all the tickets for tonight's show had been sold. \"But surely you can find a spare one somewhere,\" I laughed. There was always lots of space in the aisles and it was usually never a problem to stick in a few extra chairs.</p><p>\"Is it wise, inviting a child to the show?\" Mr Tall asked. \"Children tend to fare unfavourably here. Yourself, Steve Leonard, Sam Grest.\" Sam was a boy who'd had a fatal run-in with the Wolf Man. He was the first person I'd drunk blood from. Part of his spirit - not to mention his taste for pickled onions! - still lived on within me.</p><p>\"Why mention Sam?\" I asked, confused. I couldn't remember the last time Mr Tall had made a reference to my long-dead friend.</p><p>\"No reason in particular,\" Mr Tall said. \"I just think this is a dangerous place for children.\" Then he produced a ticket out of thin air and handed it to me. \"Give it to the boy if you wish,\" he grumbled, as if I'd squeezed an inconvenient favour out of him.</p><p>I walked back slowly to Darius and Harkat, wondering why Mr Tall had behaved in such a curious manner. Had he been trying to warn me not to let Darius get too closely involved with the Cirque Du Freak? Was Darius like Sam Grest, eager to leave home and travel around with a band of magical performers? By inviting him to the show, was I setting him up for a fall like Sam's?</p>","<p>I found Darius standing where I'd left him. He didn't look like he'd moved a muscle. Harkat was on the other side of the fire, keeping a green eye on the boy. I hesitated before giving Darius his ticket. \"What do you think of the Cirque Du Freak?\" I asked.</p><p>\"It's OK,\" he shrugged.</p><p>\"How would you feel about joining?\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" he asked.</p><p>\"If there was an opening, and you had the chance to leave home, would?\"</p><p>\"No way!\" he snapped before I finished.</p><p>\"You're happy at home?\" Yes.</p><p>\"You don't want to travel around the world?\"</p><p>\"Not with you lot.\"</p><p>I smiled and gave him the ticket. \"That's OK then. The show starts at ten. Will you be able to come?\"</p><p>\"Of course,\" Darius said, pocketing the ticket without looking at it.</p><p>\"What about your parents?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I'll go to bed early, then sneak out,\" he said, and giggled slyly.</p><p>\"If you're caught, don't tell them about us,\" I warned him.</p><p>\"As if!\" he snorted, then waved sharply and left. He looked at me one final time before he passed out of sight, and again there was something odd about his gaze.</p><p>Harkat walked around the fire and stared after the boy.</p><p>\"A strange kid,\" I commented.</p><p>\"More than just strange,\" Harkat murmured.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I don't like him,\" Harkat said.</p><p>\"He was a bit sullen,\" I agreed, \"but lots of kids his age are like that. I was that way myself when I first joined the Cirque Du Freak.\"</p><p>\"I don't know.\" Harkat's eyes were full of doubt. \"I didn't buy his story about his? friend, Oggy. If he's such a scaredy cat, what was he? doing exploring up here by himself?\"</p><p>\"You're getting suspicious in your old age,\" I laughed.</p><p>Harkat shook his head slowly. \"You didn't pick up on it.\"</p><p>\"What?\" I frowned.</p><p>\"When he accused us of threatening him, he said? 'creatures like you'.\" So?</p><p>Harkat smiled thinly. \"I'm quite obviouslynot human. But what tipped him off to the fact? thatyou aren't either?\"</p><p>A sudden chill ran through me. Harkat was right - the boy had known more about us than he should have. And I realized now what it was about Darius's gaze which had disturbed me. When he thought I wasn't looking, his eyes kept going to the scars on my fingertips, the standard marks of a vampire - like he knew what they meant!</p><p>Chapter SEVEN</p><p>Harkat and I weren't sure what to make of Darius. It seemed unlikely that the vampaneze would recruit children. But there was the twisted mind of their leader, Steve Leopard, to take into account. This could be one of his evil, hate-fuelled games. We decided to take the boy to one side when he came to the show, and pump him for information. We wouldn't resort to torture or anything so drastic - just try to scare a few answers out of him.</p><p>We were supposed to help the performers get ready for the show, but we told Mr Tall we were busy and he assigned our tasks to other members of the troupe. If he knew about our plans for Darius, he didn't say so.</p><p>There were two entrances to the big top. Shortly before the audience started to arrive, Harkat and I each took up a position close to one of the entry points, where we could watch for Darius. I was still worried about being recognized by somebody who'd known me in the past, so I stood in the shadows beside the entrance, disguised in a set of Harkat's blue robes, the hood pulled up to hide my face. I watched silently as the early birds trickled in, handing their tickets to Jekkus Flang (Mr Tall was on the other entrance). With every third or fourth customer, Jekkus threw their ticket into the air, then launched a knife at it, spearing it through the middle and pinning it to a nearby post.</p><p>As the trickle of people turned into a steady stream, and Jekkus pinned more and more tickets to the pole, the tickets and knives took on the outline of a hanged man. People chuckled edgily when they realized what Jekkus was doing. A few paused to commend him on his knife-throwing skills, but most hurried past to their seats, some glancing backwards at the figure of the hanged man, perhaps wondering if it was an omen of things to come.</p><p>I ignored the hanged man - I'd seen Jekkus perform this trick many times before - and focused on the faces in the crowd. It was hard to note everybody who passed in the crush, especially short people. Even if Darius entered this way, there was no guarantee I'd spot him.</p><p>Towards the end of the line, as the last members of the audience were filing in, Jekkus gave a gasp of surprise and abandoned his post. \"Tom Jones!\" he shouted, bounding forward. \"What an honour!\"</p><p>It was the town's famous goalkeeper, Tom Jones - my old school friend!</p><p>Tommy smiled awkwardly and shook Jekkus's hand.</p><p>\"Hi,\" he coughed, looking around to see if anyone else had noticed him. Apart from those nearest us, nobody had - all eyes were fixed on the stage, as everyone awaited the start of the show.</p><p>\"I've seen you play!\" Jekkus enthused. \"I don't get to many games - the curse of travelling - but I've made it to a few. You're awesome! Do you think we'll win tomorrow? I wanted to get a ticket, but they were sold out.\"</p><p>\"It's a big match,\" Tommy said. \"I could try to get one for you, but I don't think?\"</p><p>\"That's OK,\" Jekkus interrupted. \"I'm not trying to shake you down for free tickets. Just wanted to wish you good luck. Now, speaking of tickets, could I see yours?\"</p><p>Tommy gave his ticket to Jekkus, who askedif Tommy would sign it for him. Tommy obliged and Jekkus pocketed the ticket, beaming happily. He offered to find a seat for Tommy near the front, but Tommy said he was happy to sit at the back. \"I don't think it would be good for my image if word got out that I came to shows like this,\" he laughed.</p><p>As Tommy made his way to one of the few free seats, I breathed a sigh of relief - he hadn't seen me. The luck of the vampires was on my side. I waited a few more minutes, until the final stragglers had been admitted, then crept out as Jekkus closed off the entrance. I linked up with Harkat.</p><p>\"Did you see him?\" I asked.</p><p>\"No,\" Harkat said. \"You?\"</p><p>\"No. But I saw an old friend.\" I told him about Tom Jones.</p><p>\"Could it be a setup?\" Harkat asked.</p>","<p>\"I doubt it,\" I said. \"Tommy wanted to come to the Cirque Du Freak the last time it was in town. He's here for the match tomorrow. He must have heard about the show and picked up a ticket - easy when you're a celebrity.\"</p><p>\"But isn't it a bit too coincidental that? he's here the same time as us?\" Harkat persisted.</p><p>\"He's here because his team's in the cup semi-final,\" I reminded Harkat. \"Steve couldn't have engineered that - even the Lord of the Vampaneze has his limits!\"</p><p>\"You're right,\" Harkat laughed. \"I really am getting paranoid!\"</p><p>\"Let's forget about Tommy,\" I said. \"What about Darius? Could he have got in without us seeing him?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Harkat said. \"It was impossible to identify? everyone who entered. A child could have easily? passed without us noticing.\"</p><p>\"Then we've got to go inside and look for him,\" I said.</p><p>\"Steady on.\" Harkat stopped me. \"Although your friend Tommy's being here is most likely? nothing to worry about, let's not tempt fate. If you go in, your hood might slip? and he might see you. Leave it to me.\"</p><p>While I waited outside, Harkat entered the tent and patrolled the aisles, checking the faces of every audience member as the show got under way. More than half an hour passed before he emerged.</p><p>\"I didn't see him,\" Harkat said.</p><p>\"Maybe he wasn't able to sneak away from home,\" I said.</p><p>\"Or maybe he sensed we were? suspicious of him,\" Harkat said. \"Either way, we can't do anything except? keep watch the rest of the time we're here. He might come sneaking around? by day again.\"</p><p>Although it was anticlimactic, I was glad Darius hadn't shown. I hadn't been looking forward to threatening the boy. It was better this way, for all concerned. And the more I thought about it, the more ridiculous our reaction seemed. Darius had certainly known more about us than any child should, but maybe he'd simply read the right books or found out about us on the Internet. Not many humans know about the true marks of a vampire, or that Little People exist, but the truth (like they used to say on that famous TV show) is out there! There were any number of ways a clued-up kid could have found out the facts about us.</p><p>Harkat wasn't as relaxed as I was, and he insisted we stay outside the entrances until the show finished, in case Darius turned up late. There was no harm in being cautious, so I kept watch throughout the rest of the show, listening to the gasps, screams and applause of the people inside the tent. I slipped away a few minutes before the end and collected Harkat. We hid in a van as the crowd poured out, and only emerged when the final excited customer had left the stadium.</p><p>We gathered with most of the performers and backstage crew in a tent behind the big top, for the post-show party. There wasn't a celebration after each performance, but we liked to let our hair down every once in a while. It was a hard life on the road, driving long distances, working doggedly, keeping a low profile so as not to attract attention. It was good to chill out every so often.</p><p>There were a few guests in the tent - police officers, council officials, wealthy businessmen. Mr Tall knew how to grease the right palms, to make life easy for us.</p><p>Our visitors were particularly interested in Harkat. The normal audience members hadn't seen the grey-skinned Little Person. This was a chance for the special guests to experience something different, which they could boast about to their friends. Harkat knew what was expected of him and he let the humans examine him, telling them a bit about his past, politely answering their questions.</p><p>I sat in a quiet corner of the tent, munching a sandwich, washing it down with water. I was getting ready to leave when Jekkus Flang pushed his way through a knot of people and introduced me to the guest he'd just led into the tent. \"Darren, this is the world's best goalkeeper, Tom Jones. Tom, this is my good friend and fellow workmate, Darren Shan.\"</p><p>I groaned and closed my eyes. So much for the luck of the vampires.' I heard Tommy gasp with recognition. Opening my eyes, I forced a smile, stood, shook Tommy's hand - his eyes were bulging out of his head - and said, \"Hello, Tommy. It's been a long time. Can I get you something to drink?\"</p><p>Chapter EIGHT</p><p>Tommy was astonished to see me alive when I'd been declared dead and buried eighteen years earlier. Then there was the fact that I only looked a handful of years older. It was almost too much for him to comprehend. For a while he listened to me talk, nodding weakly, not taking anything in. But eventually his head cleared and he focused on what I was saying.</p><p>I spun him a far-fetched but just about believable tale. I felt bad, lying to my old friend, but the truth was stranger than fiction - it was simpler and safer this way. I said I had a rare disease which prevented me from ageing normally. It was discovered when I was a child. The doctors gave me five or six years to live. My parents were devastated by the news, but since we could do nothing to prevent it, we told no one and tried to lead a normal life for as long as we could.</p><p>Then the Cirque Du Freak came to town.</p><p>\"I ran into an extraordinary physician,\" I lied. \"He was travelling with the Cirque, making a study of the freaks. He said he could help me, but I'd have to leave home and travel with the Cirque - I'd need constant monitoring. I talked it over with my parents and we decided to fake my death, so I could leave without arousing suspicions.\"</p><p>\"But for heaven's sake, why?\" Tommy exploded. \"Your parents could have left with you. Why put everyone through so much pain?\"</p><p>\"How would we have explained it?\" I sighed. \"The Cirque Du Freak is an illegal travelling show. My parents would have had to give up everything and gone undercover to be with me. It wouldn't have been fair on them, and it would have been dreadfully unfair on Annie.\"</p><p>\"But there must have been some other way,\" Tommy protested.</p><p>\"Maybe,\" I said. \"But we hadn't much time to think it over. The Cirque Du Freak was only in town for a few days. We discussed the proposal put forward by the physician and accepted it. I think the fact that I'm still alive all these years later, against all medical odds, justifies that decision.\"</p><p>Tommy shook his head uncertainly. He'd grown up to be a very large man, tall and broad, with huge hands and bulging muscles. His black hair was receding prematurely - he'd be bald in a few more years. But despite his physical presence, his eyes were soft. He was a gentle man. The idea of letting a child fake his death and be buried alive was repulsive to him.</p>","<p>\"What's done is done,\" I said. \"Maybe my parents should have searched for another way. But they had my best interests at heart. Hope was offered and they seized it, regardlessof the terrible price.\"</p><p>\"Did Annie know?\" Tommy asked.</p><p>\"No. We never told her.\" I guessed Tommy had no way of contacting my parents directly, to check out my story, but he could have gone to Annie. I had to sidetrack him.</p><p>\"Not even afterwards?\" Tommy asked.</p><p>\"I talked aboutit with Mum and Dad - we keep in touch and meet up every few years - but we never felt the time was right. Annie had her own problems, having a baby so young.\"</p><p>\"Thatwas tough,\" Tommy agreed. \"I was still living here. I didn't know her very well, but I heard all about it.\"</p><p>\"That must have been just before your football career took off,\" I said, leading him away from talk about me. We discussed his career after that, some of the big matches he'd been involved in, what he planned to do when he retired. He wasn't married but he had two kids from a previous relationship, when he'd lived abroad.</p><p>\"I only get to see them a couple of times a year and during the summer,\" he said sadly. \"I hope to move over there when I quit football, to be closer to them.\"</p><p>Most of the performers, crew and guests had departed by this stage. Harkat had seen me talking with Tommy and made a sign askingif I wanted him to stick around. I signalled back that I was OK and he'd left with the others. A few people still sat and talked softly in the tent, but nobody was near Tommy and me.</p><p>Talk turned to the past and our old friends. Tommy told me Alan Morris had become a scientist. \"Quite a famous one too,\" he said. \"He's a geneticist - big into cloning. A controversial area, but he's convinced it's the way forward.\"</p><p>\"As long as he doesn't clone himself!\" I laughed. \"One Alan Morris is enough!\"</p><p>Tommy laughed too. Alan had been a close friend of ours, but he could be a bit of a pain at times.</p><p>\"I've no idea what Steve's up to,\" Tommy said, and the laughter died on my lips. \"He left home at sixteen. Ran off without a word to anyone. I've spoken to him on the phone a few times, but I've only seen him once since then, about ten years ago. He returned home for a few months when his mother died.\"</p><p>\"I didn't know she was dead,\" I said. \"I'm sorry. I liked Steve's Mum.\"</p><p>\"He sold off the house and all her effects. He shared an apartment with Alan for a while. That was before?\" Tommy stopped and glanced at me oddly. \"Haveyou seen Steve since you left?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I lied.</p><p>\"You don't know anything about him?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I lied again.</p><p>\"Nothing at all?\" Tommy pressed.</p><p>I forced a chuckle. \"Why are you so concerned about Steve?\"</p><p>Tommy shrugged. \"He got into some trouble the last time he was here. I thought you might have heard about it from your parents.\"</p><p>\"We don't discuss the past,\" I said, elaborating on the lie I'd concocted. I leant forward curiously. \"What did Steve do?\" I asked, wondering if it was in any way linked to his vampaneze activities.</p><p>\"Oh, I don't rightly remember,\" Tommy said, shifting uncomfortably - he was lying. \"It's old history. Best not to bring it up. You know what Steve was like, always in one form of trouble or another.\"</p><p>\"That's for sure,\" I muttered. Then my eyes narrowed. \"You said you've talked to him on the phone?\"</p><p>\"Yeah. He rings every so often, asks what I'm up to, says nothing about what he's doing, then hangs up!\"</p><p>\"When was the last time he rang?\"</p><p>Tommy thought about it. \"Two, maybe three years ago. A long time.\"</p><p>\"Have you a contact number for him?\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>A shame. I'd thought for a moment that Tommy might be my path back to Steve, but it seemed he wasn't.</p><p>\"What's the time?\" Tommy asked. He looked at his watch and groaned. \"If my manager finds out how late I've been out, he'll sack me! Sorry, Darren, but I really have to go.\"</p><p>\"That's OK,\" I smiled, standing to shake his hand.</p><p>\"Maybe we could meet up again after the match?\"</p><p>\"Yeah!\" Tommy exclaimed. \"I'm not travelling back with the team - I'm staying here for the night, to see some relatives. You can come to the hotel after the game and? Actually, how'd you like to come see me play?\"</p><p>\"At the semi-final?\" My eyes lit up. \"I'd love to. But didn't I hear you telling Jekkus the tickets were sold out?\"</p><p>\"Jekkus?\" Tommy frowned.</p><p>\"The guy with the knives - your number-one fan.\"</p><p>\"Oh.\" Tommy grimaced. \"I can't give away tickets to all my fans. But family and friends are a different story.\"</p><p>\"I wouldn't be sitting near anyone who knew me, would I?\" I asked. \"I don't want the truth about me going any further - Annie might hear about it.\"</p><p>\"I'll get you a seat away from the others,\" Tommy promised. Then he paused. \"You know, Annie's not a girl any more. I saw her a year ago, the last time I was here for a match. She struck me as being very level-headed. Maybe it's time to tell her the truth.\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\" I smiled, knowing I wouldn't.</p><p>\"I really think you should,\" Tommy pressed. \"It would be a shock, like it was for me, but I'm sure she'd be delighted to know you're alive and well.\"</p><p>\"We'll see,\" I said.</p><p>I walked Tommy out of the tent, through the campsite and stadium tunnels to where his car was parked. I bid him goodnight at the car, but he stopped before getting in and stared at me seriously. \"We must talk some more about Steve tomorrow,\" he said.</p><p>My heart skipped a beat. \"Why?\" I asked as casually as I could.</p><p>\"There are things you should know. I don't want to get into them now - it's too late - but I think?\" He trailed off into silence, then smiled. \"We'll talk about it tomorrow. It might help you make up your mind about some other things.\"</p><p>And on that cryptic note he said farewell. He promised to send over a ticket in the morning, gave me his hotel name and mobile number, shook my hand one last time, got into his car and drove away.</p><p>I stood outside the walls of the stadium a long while, thinking about Tommy, Annie and the past - and wondering what he'd meant when he said we needed to talk some more about Steve.</p>","<p>Chapter NINE</p><p>When I told Harkat about the match, he reacted with automatic suspicion. \"It's a trap,\" he said. \"Your friend is an ally of? Steve Leonard.\"</p><p>\"Not Tommy,\" I said with absolute certainty. \"But I've a feeling he might in some way be able to direct us to him, or set us on his trail.\"</p><p>\"Do you want me to come with? you to the match?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"You wouldn't be able to get in. Besides,\" I laughed, \"there'll be tens of thousands of people there. In a crowd like that, I think I'll be safe!\"</p><p>The ticket was delivered by courier and I set off in good time for the match. I arrived an hour before kickoff. A huge crowd milled around outside the stadium. People were singing and cheering, decked out in their club colours, buying drinks, hot dogs and burgers from the street vendors. Troops of police kept a close watch on the situation, making sure rival fans didn't clash.</p><p>I mingled for a while, strolling around the stadium, relishing the atmosphere. I bought a hot dog, a match programme, and a hat with Tommy's picture on it, sporting the slogan, \"He's not unusual!\" There were lots of hats and badges dedicated to Tommy. There were even CDs by the singer Tom Jones, with photos of Tommy taped across the covers!</p><p>I took my seat twenty minutes before kickoff. I had a greatview of the floodlit pitch. My seat was in the middle of the stadium, just a few rows behind the dugouts. The teams were warming up when I arrived. I got a real buzz out of seeing Tommy in one of the goals, stopping practice shots. To think one of my friends was playing in a cup semi-final! I'd come a long way since childhood and put most of my human interests behind me. But my love of football came flooding back as I sat, gazing down at Tommy, and I felt a ball of pure childish excitement build in the pit of my stomach.</p><p>The teams left the pitch to get ready for kickoff, then re-emerged a few minutes later. All the seats in the stadium had been filled and there was a huge cheer as the players marched out. Most people stood up, clapping and hollering. The ref tossed a coin to decide which way the teams would play, then the captains shook hands, the players lined up, the ref blew his whistle, and the match got underway.</p><p>It was a brilliant game. Both teams went all-out for the win. Tackles flew in fast and hard. Play shifted from one end to the other, both sides attacking in turn. There were lots of chances to score. Tommy made some great saves, as did the other keeper. A couple of players blasted wide or over the bar from good positions, to a chorus of jeers and groans. After forty-three minutes, the teams seemed like they'd be heading in level at half-time. But then there was a quick break, a defender slipped, a forward had a clear shot at goal, and he sent the ball flying into the left corner of the net, past the outstretched fingers of a flailing Tom Jones.</p><p>Tommy and his team-mates looked dejected as they trudged off at half-time, but their fans - and the locals who'd come to cheer for Tommy - kept on singing, \"One-nil down, two-one up, that's the way to win the cup!\"</p><p>I went to get a drink but the size of the queue was frightening - the more experienced fans had slipped out just before the half-time whistle. I walked around to stretch my legs, then returned to my seat.</p><p>Although they were a goal down, Tommy's team looked the more confident when they came out after the break. They attacked from the start of the half, knocking their opponents off the ball, pushing them back, driving hard for goal. The game grew heated and three players were booked within the first quarter of an hour. But their new found hunger was rewarded in the sixty-fourth minute when they scored a scrappy goal from a corner to pull level.</p><p>The stadium erupted when Tommy's team scored. I was one of the thousands who leapt from their seats and punched the air with joy. I even joined in with the song to the silenced fans of the other team, \"You're not singing, you're not singing, you're not singing any more!\"</p><p>Five minutes later, I was chanting even louder when, from another corner, the team scored again to go two-one up. I found myself hugging the guy next to me - a total stranger! - and jumping up and down with glee. I could hardly believe I was behaving this way. What would the Vampire Generals say if they saw a Prince acting so ridiculously!</p><p>The rest of the game was a tense affair. Now that they were a goal down, the other team had to attack in search of an equalizer. Tommy's team-mates were forced further back inside their own half. There were dozens of desperate defensive tackles, lots of free kicks, more yellow cards. But they were holding out. Tommy had to make a few fairly easy saves, but apart from that his goal wasn't troubled. With six minutes to go, the win looked safe.</p><p>Then, in virtually an action replay of the first goal, a player slipped free of his defender and found himself in front of goal, with only Tommy to beat. Once again the ball was struck firmly and accurately. It streaked towards the lower left corner of the net. The striker turned away to celebrate.</p><p>But he'd reacted too soon. Because this time, somehow, Tommy got down and across, and managed to get a few fingers to the ball. He only barely connected, but it was enough to tip the ball out around the post.</p><p>The crowd went wild! They were chanting Tommy's name and singing, \"It's not unusual, he's the greatest number one!\" Tommy ignored the songs and stayed focused on the corner, directing his defenders. But the save had sapped the other team of their spirit, and though they kept coming forward for the final few minutes, they didn't threaten to score again.</p><p>When the whistle blew, Tommy's team wearily embraced each other, then shook their opponents' hands and swapped jerseys. After that they saluted their fans, acknowledging their support. We were all on our feet, applauding, singing victory songs, a lot of them about the incredible Tom Jones.</p><p>Tommy was one of the last players to leave the pitch. He'd swapped his jersey with his opposite number and the pair were walking off together, discussing the game. I roared Tommy's name as he came level with the dugouts, but of course he couldn't hear me over the noise of the crowd.</p><p>Just as Tommy was about to vanish down the tunnel to the dressing-rooms, a commotion broke out. I heard angry yells, then several sharp bangs. Most of the people around me didn't know what was happening. But I'd heard these sounds before - gunfire!</p><p>I couldn't see down the tunnel from where I was, but I saw Tommy and the other goalkeeper stop, confused, then back away from the tunnel entrance. I immediately sensed danger. \"Tommy!\" I screamed, then knocked aside the people nearest me and forced my way down towards the pitch. Before I got there, a steward reeled out of the tunnel, blood pouring from his face. When the people in front of me saw that, they panicked. Turning, they pushed away from the pitch, halting my advance and forcing me back.</p>","<p>As I struggled to break free, two figures darted out of the tunnel. One was a shaven-headed, shotgun-toting vampet with a disfigured, half-blown-away face. The other was a bearded, purple-skinned, crazy vampaneze with silver and gold hooks instead of hands.</p><p>Morgan James and R. V!</p><p>I screamed with fresh fear when I saw the murderous pair, and shoved aside everyone around me, drawing upon the full extent of my vampiric powers. But before I could bruise a way through, R.V. homed in on his target. He bounded past the dugouts, ignored the players, coaching staff and stewards on the pitch, and bore down on a startled Tom Jones.</p><p>I don't know what flashed through Tommy's mind when he saw the burly, purple monster streaking towards him. Maybe he thought it was a practical joke, or a weird fan coming to hug him. Either way, he didn't react, raise his hands to defend himself, or turn to run. He just stood, staring dumbly at R.V.</p><p>When R.V. reached Tommy, he pulled back his right hand - the one with the gold hooks - then jabbed the blades sharply into Tommy's chest. I froze, feeling Tommy's pain from where I was trapped in the crowd. Then R.V. jerked his hooked hand back, shook his head with insane delight, and retreated down the tunnel, following Morgan James, who fired his gun to clear a path.</p><p>On the pitch, Tommy stared stupidly down at the red, jagged hole in the left side of his chest. Then, with almost comical effect, he slid gracelessly to the ground, twitched a few times, and lay still - the terrible, unmistakable stillness of the dead.</p><p>Chapter TEN</p><p>Bursting free of the crowd, I stumbled on to the pitch. Those around me were staring at the fallen goalkeeper, paralyzed with shock. My first instinct was to run to Tommy. But then my training kicked in. Tommy had been killed. I could grieve for him later. Right now I had to focus on R.V. and Morgan James. If I hurried after them, I might catch up before they got away.</p><p>Tearing my gaze away from Tommy, I ducked down the tunnel, past the players, staff and stewards who had yet to recover their senses. I saw more shot-up bodies but didn't stop to check whether they were living or dead. I had to be a vampire, not a human. A killer, not a carer.</p><p>I raced down the tunnel until it branched off in two directions. Left or right? I stood, panting, scanning the corridors for clues. Nothing to my left, but there was a small red mark on the wall to my right - blood.</p><p>I picked up speed again. A voice at the back of my mind whispered, \"You have no weapons. How will you defend yourself?\" I ignored it.</p><p>The corridor led to a dressing room, where most members of the winning team had gathered. The players weren't aware of what had happened on the pitch. They were cheering and singing. The corridor branched again here. The path to the left led back towards the pitch, so I took another right turn, praying to the gods of the vampires that I'd chosen correctly.</p><p>A long sprint. The corridor was narrow and low-ceilinged. I was panting hard, not from exertion but sorrow. I kept thinking about Tommy, Mr Crepsley, Gavner Purl - friends I'd lost to the vampaneze. I had to fight the sorrow, or it would overwhelm me, so I thought about R.V. and Morgan James instead.</p><p>R.V. was once an eco-warrior. He'd tried to free the Wolf Man at the Cirque Du Freak. I'd stopped him but not before the Wolf Man had bitten his hands off. R.V. fled, survived, and blamed me for his misfortune. Some years later, he was discovered by Steve Leopard. Steve told the vampaneze to blood him, and the pair plotted my downfall. R.V. had been in the Cavern of Retribution when Mr Crepsley was killed. That was the last time I'd seen him.</p><p>Morgan James was an ex-police officer. A vampet, one of the humans the vampaneze had recruited. Like the other vampets, he dressed in a brown shirt and black trousers, shaved his head, painted circles of blood around his eyes, and had a \"V\" tattooed above either ear. Since he hadn't been blooded, he was free to use missile-firing weapons such as guns. Vampaneze, like vampires, swear an oath when they're blooded not to use such weapons. James had also been in the Cavern of Retribution. During the battle he was shot, and the left side of his face had been torn into fleshy strips by the bullet.</p><p>A treacherous, deadly pair. Again I found myself wondering what I'd do if I caught up with them - I hadn't any weapons! But again I ignored that problem and concentrated on the chase.</p><p>The end of the corridor. A door swinging ajar. Two police officers and a steward lying slumped against the wall - dead. I cursed R.V. and Morgan James, and swore revenge.</p><p>I kicked the door wide open and ducked out. I was at the rear of the stadium, the quietest part of the area, backing on to a housing estate. The police out here had been attracted to the sides of the stadium - there was some kind of a disturbance at the front, no doubt timed to tie in with the assault.</p><p>Ahead of me I saw R.V. and Morgan James enter the estate. By the time the police turned their attention this way, the killers would be gone. I started after them. Stopped. Hurried back inside the stadium and frisked the dead police officers. No guns, but both had been carrying truncheons. I took the clubs, one for each hand, then fled after my prey.</p><p>It was dark on the estate, especially after the brightness of the stadium. But I had the extra-sharp vision of a half-vampire, so I was able to negotiate my way without any problems. The road branched off at regular intervals, seven or eight houses per stretch. I paused briefly at each junction, looking left and right. No sign of R.V. and Morgan James. Forward again.</p><p>I wasn't sure if they knew I was following. I assumed they knew I was at the match, but they might not have counted on me being the first to break out of the stadium and pursue them. The element of surprisemight be on my side, but I warned myself not to count on it.</p><p>I came to the last junction. Left or right? I stood in the road, head twisting one way, then the other. I couldn't see anyone. I'd lost them.' Should I take a direction at random or backtrack and?</p><p>There was a soft screeching sound to my left - a blade scraping against a wall. Then someone hissed, \"Quiet!\"</p><p>I turned. There was a tiny alley between two houses, the source of the noise. The nearest street lights had been smashed. The only illumination came from across the road. I had a bad feeling about this - the screech and hiss had been far too convenient - but I couldn't back off now. I advanced.</p><p>I stopped a couple of metres shy of the alley and edged out into the middle of the road. My knuckles were white from gripping the truncheons. I came into gradual sight of the alley. Nobody near the dark mouth. The alley only ran back five or six metres, and even in the poor light I could see all the way to the rear wall. Nobody was there. I breathed out shakily. Maybe my ears had been playing tricks. Or else the sound had been a TV or radio. What should I do now? I was back where I'd been moments before, no idea which way to?</p>","<p>Something moved in the alley, low down on the floor. I stiffened and lowered my sights. And now I saw them, crouched where it was darkest, one hugging either wall, practically invisible in the shadows.</p><p>The figure to my left chuckled, then stood - R.V. I raised the truncheon in my left hand defensively. Then the figure to my right rose, and Morgan James stepped forward, bringing up his shotgun, pointing it at me. I began to raise the truncheon in my right hand against him, then realized how worthless it would be if he fired.</p><p>I took another step back, meaning to run, when a voice spoke from the darkness behind R.V. \"No guns,\" it said softly. Morgan James immediately lowered the barrel of his shotgun.</p><p>I should have run, but I couldn't, not without putting a face to that voice. So I stood my ground, squinting, as a third shape formed and stepped out from behind R.V. It was Gannen Harst, the prime protector of the Lord of the Vampaneze.</p><p>Part of me had expected this, and instead of panicking, I experienced something close to relief. The waiting was over. Whatever destiny had in store for me, it started here. One final encounter with the Vampaneze Lord. At the end of it, I'd kill him - or he'd kill me. Either way was better than the waiting.</p><p>\"Hello, Gannen,\" I said. \"Still hanging out with madmen and scum, I see.\"</p><p>Gannen Harst bristled but didn't reply. \"Lord,\" he said instead, and a fourth ambusher stepped out from behind Morgan James, more familiar than any of the others.</p><p>\"Good to see you again, Steve,\" I said cynically as the grey-haired Steve Leopard slid into view. I was partly focused on Gannen Harst, R.V. and Morgan James - but mostly on Steve. I was judging the gap between us, wondering what sort of damage I could do if I hurled my truncheons at him. I didn't care about the other three - killing the Vampaneze Lord was my first priority.</p><p>\"He doesn't look surprised to see us,\" Steve remarked. He hadn't stepped out as far as Gannen Harst, and was protected by the body of Morgan James. I might be able to hit him from this angle - but it was a very bigmight .</p><p>\"Let me have him,\" R.V. snarled, taking a step towards me. The last time I'd seen him, he'd been wearing red contact lenses, and had painted his skin purple, to look more like a vampaneze. But his eyes and skin had changed naturally over the past two years, and though his colouring was slight in comparison to a mature vampaneze, it was genuine.</p><p>\"Stay where you are,\" Steve said to R.V. \"We can all have a slice of him later. Let's finish the introductions first. Darius.\"</p><p>From behind Steve, the boy called Darius stepped out. He was wearing green robes, like Steve. He was shivering, but his face was set sternly. He was holding a large arrow-gun, one of Steve's inventions. It was pointed at me.</p><p>\"Have you started blooding children now?\" I growled disgustedly, still waiting for Steve to move out a little more, ignoring the threat of the boy's arrow-gun.</p><p>\"Darius is an exception,\" Steve said, smiling. \"A most worthy ally and a valuable spy.\"</p><p>Steve took a half-step towards the boy. This was my chance! I began to draw my right hand back, careful not to give my intentions away, totally focused on Steve. Another second or two and I could make my play?</p><p>Then Darius spoke.</p><p>\"Shall I shoot him now, Dad?\"</p><p>DAD?</p><p>\"Yes, son,\" Steve replied.</p><p>SON?</p><p>While my brain spun and whirled like a dervish, Darius steadied his aim, gulped, pulled the trigger, and shot a steel-tipped arrow straight at me.</p><p>Chapter ELEVEN</p><p>The arrow struck me high in my right shoulder, knocking me backwards. I roared with agony, grabbed the shaft of the arrow and pulled. The shaft broke off in my hand, leaving the head stuck deep in my flesh.</p><p>For a moment the world around me turned red. I thought I was going to pass out. But then the crimson haze faded and the road and houses swam back into focus. Over the sound of my pained panting, I heard footsteps coming towards me. Sitting up - grinding my teeth together to fight back a wave of fresh pain - I saw Steve leading his small band in for the kill.</p><p>I'd let go of the truncheons when I fell. One had rolled away, but the other was close by. I snatched for it and for the shaft of the arrow - the splintered end could be used as a crude dagger. When Gannen Harst saw this, he stepped in front of Steve. \"Fan out!\" he commanded R.V. and Morgan James. They swiftly obeyed. The boy, Darius, was behind Steve. He looked sick. I don't think he'd ever shot anyone before.</p><p>\"Keep back!\" I hissed, waving my pitiful weapons at them.</p><p>\"Make us,\" R.V. giggled.</p><p>\"Uhr'd luhk tuh shee im truhy!\" said Morgan James, who could only speak in a slur since his accident.</p><p>\"We won't let him try anything,\" Gannen Harst said quietly. He hadn't drawn his sword yet, but his right hand was hanging purposefully by his scabbard. \"He's a dangerous foe, even injured - don't forget that.\"</p><p>\"You think too much of the boy,\" Steve purred, looking at me over his protector's shoulder. \"He won't even be able to get up with a wound like that.\"</p><p>\"Won't I?\" I snorted, and pushed myself to my feet just to spite him. A red curtain descended for the second time, but again it passed after a couple of seconds. When my sight cleared, I saw Steve grinning wickedly - he'd goaded me to my feet on purpose, to string more entertainment out of me.</p><p>Waving the arrow shaft around at the four men, I backed away. Each step was torture, the pain in my right shoulder flaring up at the slightest movement. It was clear I couldn't get very far, but Gannen was taking no chances. He sent R.V. to my left and James to my right, blocking my route in both directions.</p><p>I stopped, weaving heavily on my feet, woozily trying to formulate a plan. I knew only Steve could kill me - Des Tiny had predicted doom for the vampaneze if anybody other than their Lord killed any of the vampire hunters - but the others could hold me down for him.</p><p>\"Lets finish him off quickly,\" Gannen Harst said, finally drawing his sword. \"He is at our mercy. Let's not waste time.\"</p><p>\"Take it easy,\" Steve chuckled. \"I want to see him bleed a bit more.\"</p><p>\"And if he bleeds to death from your son's arrow?\" Gannen snapped.</p><p>\"He won't,\" Steve said. \"Darius shot exactly where I trained him to.\" Steve glanced back at the boy and caught his troubled look. \"Are you OK?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Darius croaked. \"I just didn't think it would be so? so?\"</p>","<p>\"Bloody,\" Steve said. He nodded understandingly. \"You did good work tonight. You don't have to watch the rest if you don't want to.\"</p><p>\"How did?you end up with? a son?\" I gasped, playing for time, hoping an escape would present itself.</p><p>\"A long, twisted story,\" Steve said, facing me again. \"One I'll delight in telling you before I drive a stake through your heart.\"</p><p>\"You got that? the wrong way round.\" I laughed bleakly. \"I'llbe the one doing? the killing tonight.\"</p><p>\"Optimistic to the last,\" Steve smirked. He cocked a devilish eyebrow at me. \"How did Tommy die - with dignity, or like that squealing pig Crepsley?\"</p><p>At that, something snapped inside me. I screamed a foul insult at Steve and, without thinking, hurled my truncheon at him. With blind luck, it struck his forehead and he dropped with a startled grunt.</p><p>Gannen Harst instinctively swung away from me, to check on his Lord. As soon as he made his move, I made mine. Jumping at Morgan James, I lashed out with the arrow shaft. He took a quick step back to avoid being speared. As he did, I smashed into him with my wounded right shoulder. I howled with pain as the arrow head was forced deeper into my flesh, but my ploy worked - James toppled over.</p><p>The path ahead was momentarily clear. I stumbled forward, grasping my right shoulder with my left hand, pressing hard around the hole where the arrow head was buried, trying to stem the flow of blood, weeping with agony. Behind me I heard Steve shout, \"I'm OK! Chase him! Don't let him get away!\"</p><p>If I hadn't been injured, I might have had enough of a head start on them. But I could manage nothing faster than a slow jog. It was only a matter of seconds before they'd catch up with me.</p><p>As I lurched away, my pursuers hot on my heels, a door to one of the houses on my left opened and a large man stuck his head out. \"What's all the noise about?\" he shouted angrily. \"Some of us are trying to?\"</p><p>\"Help!\" I screamed on impulse. \"Murder!\"</p><p>The man threw the door all the way open and stepped out. \"What's going on?\" he yelled.</p><p>I looked back at Steve and the others. They'd come to a halt. I had to make the most of their confusion.</p><p>\"Help!\" I screamed at the top of my lungs. \"Killers! They've shot me! Help!\"</p><p>Lights began flicking on in the neighbouring houses, and curtains were swished back. The man who'd come out started towards me. Steve sneered, reached over his shoulder, produced an arrow-gun and fired at the man. Gannen Harst knocked the arrow-gun aside just before Steve fired, so the arrow whizzed wide of its mark. But the man had seen Steve's intent and he ran back inside his house before he could be fired upon again.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" Steve furiously challenged Gannen Harst.</p><p>\"We must get out of here!\" Gannen shouted.</p><p>\"Not without killing him!\" Steve yelled, jerking his arrow-gun at me.</p><p>\"Then kill him, quick, and let's go!\" Gannen responded.</p><p>Steve stared at me, eyes filled with hatred. Behind him, R.V. and Morgan James were looking on with hungry longing, eager to see me die. Darius was further removed from the gang - I couldn't tell if he was watching or not.</p><p>Steve raised his arrow-gun, took a couple of steps closer, trained his sights on me, then?</p><p>?lowered it, unfired. \"No,\" he said sullenly. \"This is too easy. Too fast.\"</p><p>\"Don't be foolish!\" Gannen roared. \"You have to kill him! This is the predicted fourth encounter. You must do it now, before?\"</p><p>\"I'll do what I please!\" Steve yelled, turning on his mentor. For a moment I thought he meant to attack his closest ally. But then he got hold of himself and smiled tightly. \"I know what I'm doing, Gannen. I can't kill him this way.\"</p><p>\"If not now, then when?\" Gannen snarled.</p><p>\"Later,\" Steve said. \"When the time is right. When I can torment him at my leisure and make him feel the pain I felt when he betrayed me and pledged himself to Creepy Crepsley.\"</p><p>\"And Mr Tiny's prophecy?\" Gannen hissed.</p><p>\"Stuff it!\" Steve smirked. \"I'll create my own destiny. That mug in the wellies doesn't rule my life.\"</p><p>Gannen's red eyes were ablaze with rage. This was madness. He wanted Steve to kill me, to settle the War of the Scars once and for all. He would have argued the point, but more doors were opening and people were poking their heads out. Gannen realized they were in danger of attracting too much unwanted attention. He shook his head, then grabbed Steve, spun him away from me and pushed him back the way they'd come, ordering R.V. and Morgan James to retreat.</p><p>\"Catch you later, vampire-gator!\" Steve laughed, waving at me as Gannen shepherded him away.</p><p>I wanted to respond with a suitable insult, but I lacked the strength. Besides, I had to get out of there as sharply as Steve and his gang. If the people came out and found me, I'd be in major trouble. It would mean the police, hospital, recognition and arrest - I was still a wanted fugitive. The general public here might not know about the alleged killer, Darren Shan, but I was sure the police did.</p><p>Turning my back on the emerging humans, I staggered to the end of the block, where I rested a moment, leaning against a wall. I wiped sweat from my forehead and tears from my eyes, then checked the hole in my shoulder - still bleeding. There was no time to examine it further. People were spilling out on to the street. It wouldn't be long before news of the killings at the stadium trickled through. Then they'd be on their phones to the police, telling them all about the disturbance.</p><p>Pushing myself away from the wall, I stumbled left and started down a path which would hopefully lead me away from the housing estate. I tried to jog but it was too painful. I slowed to the fastest walk I could manage, bleeding with every step I took, head ringing, desperately wondering how far I could struggle on before I collapsed from loss of blood or shock.</p><p>Chapter TWELVE</p><p>I cleared the housing estate a few minutes later. In the distance police sirens screamed like banshees in the night. The stadium would be their first priority, but once word reached them of the scuffle on the housing estate, units would be sent to investigate.</p><p>As I stood bent over, panting for breath, I studied the path I'd taken and saw little puddles of blood marking my course - a clear trail for anyone who followed. If I was to progress any further undetected, I'd have to do something about my wound.</p>","<p>I examined the hole. There was a tiny bit of shaft sticking out of it, attached to the arrow head. I took hold of the light piece of wood, closed my eyes, bit down hard, and pulled. \"Charna's guts!\"</p><p>I fell back, shivering, fingers twitching, mouth opening and shutting rapidly. For maybe a minute, I knew only pain. The houses around me could have collapsed and I wouldn't have noticed.</p><p>Gradually the pain abated and I was able to study the wound again. I hadn't managed to pull the head out, but I'd drawn it closer towards the hole, plugging it up. Blood still oozed out but it wasn't flowing steadily like it had been. That would have to do. Tearing a long strip off my shirt, I balled it up and pressed it over the wound. After a few deep breaths, I got to my feet. My legs were shaking like a newborn lamb's, but they held. I made sure I wasn't dripping blood, then resumed my sluggish flight.</p><p>The next ten or fifteen minutes passed in a slow, agonized blur. I had enough sense left to keep moving, but I wasn't able to take note of street names or plot a course back to the Cirque Du Freak. All I knew was that I couldn't stop.</p><p>I kept to the sides of streets and alleys, so I could grab a fence for support or lean against a wall to rest. I didn't pass many people. Those I did pass ignored me. That surprised me, even in my dazed state, until I realized how I must look. A teenager, reeling along the path, head bowed, body crooked over, moaning softly - they thought I was drunk!</p><p>Eventually I had to stop. I was at the end of my rope. If I didn't sit down and rest, I'd drop in the middle of the street. Luckily I was close to a dark alley. I fell into it and crawled away from the streetlights, deep into welcome shadows. I stopped beside a large black garbage bin, sat up against the wall by which it was set, and dragged my legs in.</p><p>\"Just? a short? rest,\" I wheezed, laying my head on my knees, wincing at the pain in my shoulder. \"A few? minutes? and then I can?\"</p><p>I got no further. My eyelids fluttered shut and I flaked out, at the mercy of any who happened to chance upon me.</p><p>My eyes opened. It was later, darker, colder. I felt like I was encased in a block of ice. I tried lifting my head, but even that small effort proved too much for me. I blacked out again.</p><p>The next time I awoke, I was choking. Some stinging liquid was being forced down my throat. For a confused moment I thought I was a raw half-vampire again, and that Mr Crepsley was trying to force me to drink human blood. \"No!\" I mumbled, slapping at the hands holding my head. \"Not gonna? be like you!\"</p><p>\"Hold him still!\" someone grunted.</p><p>\"It's not that easy,\" the person holding me complained. \"He's stronger than he looks.\" Then I felt a body pressing down on mine and a voice whispered in my ear, \"Steady, kid. We're only trying to help.\"</p><p>My head cleared slightly and I stopped struggling. Blinking, I tried to focus on the faces of the men around me, but it was either too dark or my sight was clouded with pain. \"What? are you?\" I gasped, meaning were they friends or foes.</p><p>The man holding me must have misheard my question, and thought I'd askedwho were they. \"I'm Declan,\" he said. \"This is Little Kenny.\"</p><p>\"Open wide,\" Little Kenny said, pressing the rim of a bottle to my lips. \"This is cheap and nasty, but it'll warm you up.\"</p><p>I drank reluctantly, unable to argue. My stomach filled with a sickening fire. When Little Kenny took the bottle away, I leant my head back against the wall and groaned. \"What time? is it?\" I asked.</p><p>\"We don't bother with watches,\" Declan chuckled. \"But it's late, maybe one or two in the morning.\" He took hold of my chin, turned my head left and right, then picked at the strip of shirt which was stuck to my shoulder with dried blood.</p><p>\"Ow!\" I yelped.</p><p>Declan released me immediately. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"Does it hurt much?\"</p><p>\"Not? as much? as it did,\" I muttered. Then my head began to swim and I half-blacked out again. When I recovered, the two men were huddled together a metre away, discussing what to do with me.</p><p>\"Leave him,\" I heard Little Kenny hiss. \"He can't be more than sixteen or seventeen. He's no good to us.\"</p><p>\"Every person matters,\" Declan disagreed. \"We can't afford to be picky.\"</p><p>\"But he's not one ofus ,\" Little Kenny said. \"He probably has a family and home. We can't start recruiting normal people, not until we're told.\"</p><p>\"I know,\" Declan said. \"But there's something different about him. Did you see his scars? And he didn't get that wound fighting in the playground. We should take him back with us. If the ladies choose not to keep him, we can get rid of him easily enough.\"</p><p>\"But he'll know where we are!\" Little Kenny objected.</p><p>\"The shape he's in, I doubt he even knows what town this is!\" Declan snorted. \"He's got more things to worry about than marking the route we take.\"</p><p>Little Kenny grumbled something I couldn't hear, then said, \"OK, but don't forget it was your choice, not mine. I'm not taking the blame for this.\"</p><p>\"Fine,\" Declan said, and returned to my side. He rolled my eyelids all the way up and I got my first clear look at him. He was a large, bearded man, dressed in shabby clothes, covered in grime - a tramp. \"Kid,\" he said, snapping his fingers in front of my eyes. \"You awake? Do you know what's going on?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" I glanced over at Little Kenny and saw that he was also a tramp.</p><p>\"We're taking you back with us,\" Declan said. \"Can you walk?\"</p><p>I assumed that they meant to take me to a mission house or homeless shelter. That wasn't as preferable as the Cirque Du Freak, but it was better than a police station. I wet my lips and locked gazes with Declan. \"No? police,\" I moaned.</p><p>Declan laughed. \"See?\" he said to Little Kenny. \"I told you he was our kind of people!\" He took hold of my left arm and told Little Kenny to take my right. \"This will hurt,\" he warned me. \"You ready for it?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said.</p><p>They pulled me to my feet. The pain in my shoulder flared back into life, my brain ignited with fireworks, and my stomach lurched. Doubling over, I was sick on the alley floor. Declan and Little Kenny held me while 1 vomited, then hauled me up.</p><p>\"Better?\" Declan asked.</p><p>\"No!\" I gasped.</p><p>He laughed again, then shuffled around, dragging me with him, so we were facing the entrance of the alley. \"We'll carry you as best we can,\" Declan said. \"But try to use your legs - it'll make life easier for all of us.\"</p>","<p>I nodded to show I understood. Declan and Little Kenny linked hands behind my back, put their other hands on my chest to support me, then led me away.</p><p>Declan and Little Kenny were a strange pair of guardian angels. They encouraged me along with a series of curses, pushes and pulls, kicking my feet every so often to goad me into short bursts of self-momentum. We rested every few minutes, leaning against walls or lampposts, Declan and Little Kenny panting almost as hard as I was. They obviously weren't accustomed to this much exercise.</p><p>Even though it was the middle of the night, the town was abuzz. Word of the stadium slaughter had spread, and people had taken to the streets in outrage. Police cars passed us regularly, sirens blaring, flashlights glaring.</p><p>We marched in plain view of the police and angry citizens, but nobody took any notice of us. With Declan and Little Kenny holding me, I looked like the third of a trio of drunk tramps. One policeman did stop and shout at us to get the hell off the streets - hadn't we heard what happened?</p><p>\"Yes, sir,\" Declan mumbled, half-saluting the policeman. \"Going home right now. Don't suppose you could arrange a lift for us?\"</p><p>The policeman snorted and turned away. Declan chuckled, then led us on again. When we were out of earshot, he said to Little Kenny, \"Have you any idea what all the fuss is about?\"</p><p>\"Something to do with football, I think,\" Little Kenny said.</p><p>\"How about you?\" Declan asked me. \"Do you know what people are up in arms about?\"</p><p>I shook my head. Even if I'd wanted to tell them the truth, I couldn't have. The pain was worse than ever. I had to keep my teeth ground tightly together to stop myself from screaming out loud.</p><p>We carried on walking. I half-hoped I'd black out again, to numb myself to the pain. I didn't even care that Declan and Little Kenny would probably dump me in a gutter to die, rather than drag my deadweight body along. But I stayed awake, if not entirely alert, and managed to swing my legs into action when prompted.</p><p>I'd no idea where I was being taken, and I wasn't able to raise my head to mark the way. When we finally came to a halt in front of an old, brown-faced building, Little Kenny darted forward to open a door. I tried looking up to see what the number was. But even that was beyond me, and I could only stare at the ground through half-closed eyes as Declan and Little Kenny dragged me inside and laid me on a hard wooden floor.</p><p>Little Kenny stayed with me, keeping watch, as Declan went upstairs. They'd lain me on my left side, but I rolled over on to my back and stared up at the ceiling. I could feel my last sparks of consciousness flickering out. As I watched, my eyes played tricks and I imagined the ceiling was shimmering, like sea water in a light breeze.</p><p>I heard Declan coming back with somebody. He was talking quickly and quietly. I tried turning my head to see who he was bringing, but the scene on the ceding was too captivating to turn away from. Now I was imagining boats, sails filled with the breeze, circling the sea/ceiling above me.</p><p>Declan stopped by my side and examined me. Then he stepped back and the person with him bent over to look. That's when I knew I was really losing my grip on reality, because in my delirium I thought the person was Debbie Hemlock, my ex-girlfriend. I smiled weakly at the ludicrous thought of running into Debbie here. Then the woman standing over me exclaimed, \"Darren! Oh my?\"</p><p>And then there was only darkness, silence and dreams.</p><p>Chapter THIRTEEN</p><p>\"Ow! It's hot!\" I winced.</p><p>\"Don't be a baby,\" Debbie smiled, pressing a spoon of steaming hot soup to my lips. \"It's good for you.\"</p><p>\"Not if it scalds my throat,\" I grumbled. I blew on the soup to cool it, swallowed, then smiled at Debbie as she dipped the spoon into the bowl again. Harkat stood guard by the door. Outside I could hear Alice Burgess talking with one of their street people. I felt incredibly safe as I lay there, sipping soup, like nothing in the world could harm me.</p><p>It had been five days since Declan and Little Kenny rescued me. The first few days passed in a haze. I'd been wracked with pain and a high fever, senses in disarray, subject to nightmares and delusions. I kept thinking Debbie and Alice were imaginary. I'd laugh when they talked to me, convinced my brain was playing tricks.</p><p>But as the fever broke and my senses returned, the faces of the women remained constant. When I finally realized it really was Debbie, I threw my arms around her and hugged her so hard, I almost fainted again!</p><p>\"Would you like some soup?\" Debbie asked Harkat.</p><p>\"No,\" Harkat replied. \"Not hungry.\"</p><p>I asked Debbie to fetch Harkat and Mr Tall even before she'd told me what she and Alice were doing here. When my worried friend arrived - Mr Tall didn't come - I told him about Steve and his gang, and about Steve being Darius's father. Harkat's round green eyes almost doubled in size when he heard that. I wanted him to leave and contact the Vampire Generals, but he refused. He said he had to stay to protect me, and wouldn't go until I was fit again. I argued the point, but it was no good. He hadn't left the room since then, except for the occasional toilet break.</p><p>Debbie spooned the last of the soup into my mouth, wiped around my lips with a napkin, and winked. She'd hardly changed in the two years we'd been parted. The same lush dark skin, beautiful brown eyes, full lips, and tightly cropped hair. But she was more physically developed than before. She was leaner, more muscular, and she moved with a fighter's fluid grace. Her eyes were always alert. She was never totally at ease, ready to respond to any threat at an instant's notice.</p><p>The last time we'd met, Debbie and Alice had been on their way to Vampire Mountain. They were troubled by the rise of the vampaneze and shaven-headed vampets - they thought they'd turn on humanity nextif they won the War of the Scars. They decided that the vampires should create their own human force to combat the threat of the gun-wielding vampets. They planned to offer their services to the Generals, and hoped to put together a small army to battle the vampets, leaving the vampires free to tackle the vampaneze.</p><p>I didn't think the Generals would accept their proposal. Vampires have always distanced themselves from humans, and I thought they'd reject Debbie and Alice automatically. But Debbie told me that Seba Nile - the quartermaster of Vampire Mountain, and an old friend of Mr Crepsley's and mine - had spoken on their behalf. He said times had changed and the Generals needed to change with them. Vampires and vampaneze had sworn an oath never to use missile-firing weapons, but the vampets hadn't. Many vampires were being shot by the shaven-headed curs. Seba said something had to be done about it, and this was their chance to fight the vampets on level terms.</p>","<p>As the oldest living vampire, Seba was greatly respected. Upon his recommendation Debbie and Alice were accepted, albeit with reluctance. For several months they'd trained in the vampire ways, mostly at the hands of my old task master, Vanez Blane. The blind vampire taught them to fight and think as creatures of the night. It wasn't easy - the ever-wintry Vampire Mountain was a hard place to survive if you lacked the hot blood of the vampires - but they'd clung to each other for support and stuck with it, earning the admiration even of those Generals who'd greeted them with suspicion.</p><p>Ideally they'd have trained for several years, learning the ways of vampire warfare. But time was precious. The vampets were growing in number, taking part in more and more battles, killing more and more vampires. Once Debbie and Alice had covered the basics, they set out with a small band of Generals to assemble a makeshift army. Debbie told me Seba and Vanez longed to come with them, for one last taste of adventure in the outside world. But they served the clan best in Vampire Mountain, so they stayed, loyal servants to the end.</p><p>The door to my room opened and Alice stepped in. Alice Burgess used to be a police chief inspector and she looked even more warrior-like than Debbie. She was taller and broader, with more pronounced muscles. Her white hair was cut ultra-short, and though she was extremely light-skinned, there was nothing soft about her complexion. She looked as pale and deadly as a snowstorm.</p><p>\"The police are searching the neighbourhood,\" Alice said. \"They'll be here in an hour or less. Darren will have to hide again.\"</p><p>The building was old and had once been used as a church by a shady preacher. He'd created a couple of secret rooms, almost impossible to find. They were stuffy and uncomfortable, but safe. I'd stayed in one of them three times already, to avoid the police searches which had been in full flow since the massacre at the football stadium.</p><p>\"Any word from Vancha?\" I asked, sitting up and pushing the bed covers back.</p><p>\"Not yet,\" Alice said.</p><p>As the other surviving hunter, Vancha March was the only person apart from me who could freely kill Steve. Debbie and Alice didn't have a direct line to the Prince, but they'd equipped a number of the younger, more forward-thinking Generals with mobile phones. One would get word to Vancha about the situation here - eventually. I just prayed it wouldn't be too late.</p><p>Recruiting an army had proved a lot harder than it sounded. No vampire knew for sure how the vampaneze had put the vampets together, but we could imagine their recruiting strategy - find weak-willed, wicked people, then bribe them with promises of power. \"Join us and we'll teach you how to fight and kill. We'll blood you when the time is right and make you stronger than any human. As one of us, you'll live for centuries. Anything you wish for can be yours.\"</p><p>Debbie and Alice faced a much harder task. They needed good people who were willing to fight on the side of right, who recognized the threat the vampets and their masters posed, who wished to avert the prospect of living in a world where a band of killers dominated the night. Crooked, grasping, evil-hearted people were easy to find. Honest, concerned, self-sacrificing people were harder to come by.</p><p>They found a few, among police and soldiers - Alice had lots of contacts from her time on the force - but nowhere near enough to counter the threat of the vampets. For half a year they made little or no progress.</p><p>They were beginning to think it was a waste of time. Then Debbie saw the way forward.</p><p>The vampaneze were on the increase. As well as recruiting the vampets, they were blooding more vampaneze assistants than normal, driving up their numbers in a bid to win the War of the Scars by means of force. Since they were more active than usual, they needed to drink more blood, to keep up their energy levels. And when vampaneze drank blood, they killed.</p><p>So where were all the bodies?</p><p>Vampaneze had survived for six hundred years by feeding cautiously, never killing too many people in any one area, carefully hiding the bodies of their victims. There weren't many of them - never more than three hundred before the War of the Scars - and they were spread across the world. It was relatively easy to keep their presence a secret from humanity.</p><p>But now they were on the increase, feeding in groups, killing hundreds of humans every month. There was no way such a drain on humanity could have passed unnoticed by the general public - unless those they fed from weren't officially part of that public.</p><p>Tramps. Dossers. Hobos. Vagrants. Mankind had dozens of names for homeless people, those without careers, houses, families or security. Many names - but not a lot of interest. Homeless people were a nuisance, a problem, an eyesore. Whether \"ordinary\" people felt pity or disgust for them, whether they handed over change when they saw someone begging or walked straight by, one thing united most humans - they knew homeless people existed, but very few took any real notice of them. Who in any town or city could say how many homeless people were living on the streets? Who'd knowif those numbers started to drop? Who'd care?</p><p>The answer - almost nobody. Except the homeless people themselves.They'd know something was wrong. The homeless would listen, pitch in and fight. If not for the vampires, then for themselves - they were victims of the War of the Scars, and stood to lose big time if the vampaneze were triumphant.</p><p>So Debbie, Alice and their small band of Generals took their recruiting speeches to the corners of the world most humans know nothing about. They went out on the streets, into homeless shelters and mission churches, down alleys lined with rough beds made of cardboard boxes and wads of newspapers. They moved freely among the people of this subworld, facing suspicion and danger, spreading their message, in search of allies.</p><p>And they found them. There was a grapevine among the homeless, similar to that of the vampire clan. Though most lacked phones, they kept in touch with one another. It was amazing how fast a rumour could travel, and wherever Alice and Debbie went, they found people who'd heard about the murders and knew they were under attack, even though they had no idea who their attackers were.</p><p>Debbie and Alice told the street people about the vampaneze. They encountered scepticism to begin with, but the vampires with them backed them up, demonstrating their powers. In a couple of cities they helped the street folk track down vampaneze and kill them. Word spread rapidly, and over the last several months thousands of street people across the world had pledged themselves to the vampire cause. Most hadn't been trained yet. For now they were serving as eyes and ears, watching for vampaneze, passing on word of their movements.</p>","<p>They'd also chosen a name ?vampirites .</p><p>Harkat helped me out of bed and I hobbled from my room, down the corridor and stairs to the ground floor, where the hidden rooms were located. Alice came with us, to ensure all was in order. We passed Declan along the way. He was on the phone to another nearby vampirite stronghold, warning them of the police search.</p><p>The Generals with Debbie and Alice left them eventually, to resume the fight against the vampaneze - all hands were needed in the War of the Scars. A couple kept in touch, meeting up with them every month or two, monitoring their progress. But most of the time the ladies of the shadows - as the vampirites referred to them - travelled alone, choosing places where the vampaneze were active, recruiting fervently.</p><p>They'd come to my home town a fortnight ago. There'd been many reports of vampaneze here, and a band of vampirites had already formed to combat them. Debbie and Alice came to raise morale, and also to spread awareness among the street folk. That task accomplished, they'd planned to move on soon. Then I'd turned up, beaten and bleeding, and their plans changed.</p><p>I rubbed my right shoulder as I shuffled to the secret room. Alice had removed the arrowhead and stitched me up. The wound had healed cleanly, but it still stung like crazy, and I was a long way off full recovery.</p><p>Alice and Harkat moved the furniture which helped mask the entrance to the hidden room at the rear of the house. Then Alice pressed a secret panel and a section of wall slid back to reveal a cramped cell. There was a very dim light set in one of the walls.</p><p>\"They searched the house thoroughly last time,\" Alice reminded me, checking that the jug beside the mattress on the floor was filled with water. \"You could be in for another long stay.\"</p><p>\"I'll be fine,\" I said, lying down.</p><p>\"Hold on!\" I heard Debbie shout, as Alice was about to close the section of wall on me. She came hurrying to the entrance, carrying a small bag. \"I've been waiting until you were strong enough to give this to you. It will help pass the time.\"</p><p>\"What is it?\" I asked, taking the bag.</p><p>\"You'll see,\" Debbie replied, blowing me a kiss and stepping back as the cell was closed off. I waited a minute for my eyes to adjust to the dim light, then reached inside the bag and pulled out several notepads bound together by an elastic band. I broke into a smile - my diary! I'd forgotten it entirely. Now that I cast my thoughts back, I recalled handing the notepads to Alice before leaving with Harkat two years earlier.</p><p>I slipped the elastic band off the pads, thumbed through the copy on top, then paused, upended the diary, and went back eighteen years to before I sneaked out to the Cirque Du Freak and met Mr Crepsley. Within minutes I was adrift in the past, and the hours flew by as I focused on my scrawled writing, aware of nothing else.</p><p>Chapter FOURTEEN</p><p>Once I got the all clear, I returned to my bedroom and spent the next couple of days bringing my diary up to date. I'd soon filled out the most recent notepad, so Debbie brought me fresh writing material. I wrote all about my adventures with Harkat in the barren wasteland which seemed to be the world of the future. I described my fears, that the world might face destruction regardless of who won the War of the Scars, and that I might be in some way linked to the fall of mankind. I told about discovering Harkat's true identity and returning home. A quick rundown of our recent travels with the Cirque Du Freak. Then the latest cruel chapter, in which Tommy died and I learnt that Steve had a son.</p><p>I hadn't thought much about Tommy since that night. I knew the police were scouring the city in search of his killers, and that R.V. and Morgan James had killed eight others and wounded many more in the stadium. But I didn't know what the general public made of the murders, or if I'd been identified as a suspect - maybe Steve was setting me up to take the blame for this.</p><p>I asked Debbie to bring me all the local papers from the last few days. There were poor pictures of R.V. (full-vampaneze couldn't be photographed, but R.V.'s molecular system must not have changed yet) and Morgan James, but none of me. There was a brief mention of the incident outside the ground, when I'd been attacked, but the police didn't seem to place much importance on it or link it with the stadium murders.</p><p>\"Were you close to him?\" Debbie asked, tapping a photo of a smiling Tommy Jones. She was sitting on the end of my bed, watching me while I read the papers. She'd been spending a lot of time with me during my recovery, nursing me, chatting with me, telling me about her life.</p><p>\"We were good friends when we were kids,\" I sighed.</p><p>\"Do you think he knew about Steve or the vampaneze?\" Debbie asked.</p><p>\"No. He was an innocent victim. I'm sure of it.\"</p><p>\"But didn't he say he had something important to tell you?\"</p><p>I shook my head. \"He said there were things we had to discuss about Steve, but he wasn't specific. I don't think it had anything to do with this.\"</p><p>\"It scares me,\" Debbie said, taking the paper from me and folding it over.</p><p>\"You're scared because they killed Tommy?\" I frowned.</p><p>\"No - because they did it in front of tens of thousands of people. They must be full of confidence, afraid of nothing. They wouldn't have dared pull a stunt like this a few years ago. They're growing more powerful all the time.\"</p><p>\"Over-confidence may prove to be their undoing,\" I grunted. \"They were safer when nobody knew about them. Confidence has brought them out into the light, but they seem to have forgotten - light's no good for creatures of the night.\"</p><p>Debbie put the paper aside. \"How's your shoulder?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Not too bad,\" I said. \"But Alices stitch work leaves a lot to be desired - I'm going to have a terrible scar when the wound heals.\"</p><p>\"Another one for the collection,\" Debbie laughed. Her smile faded. \"I noticed a new scar on your back, long and deep. Did you get it when you went away with Harkat?\"</p><p>I nodded, remembering the monstrous Grotesque, how one of its fangs had caught between my shoulder blades and ripped downwards sharply.</p><p>\"You still haven't told me what happened, or where you went,\" Debbie said.</p><p>I sighed. \"It's not something we need to talk about right now.\"</p><p>\"But you found out who Harkat was?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said and let the matter drop. I didn't like concealing secrets from Debbie, but if that wasteworld really was the future, I saw no reason to burden Debbie with foreknowledge of it.</p>","<p>I woke early the next morning with a terrible headache. There was a small crack between the curtains, and although only a thin shaft of light was visible, I felt as if a strong torch was being shone directly into my eyes. Groaning, I stumbled out of bed and pulled the curtains closed. That helped, but my headache didn't improve. I lay as still as I could, hoping it would go away. When it didn't, I got out of bed again, meaning to go downstairs and get some aspirin. I passed Harkat on my way. He was leaning against a wall, asleep, although his lidless eyes were - as always - wide open.</p><p>I had taken a few steps down the stairs when a wave of giddiness overcame me and I fell. I grabbed for the banister, managed to catch it before I toppled over, and slid to a bruising halt halfway down the stairs. Head ringing, I sat up and looked around, dazed, wondering if this was an after-effect of my wounded shoulder. I tried shouting for help but I could only work up a croak.</p><p>A short while later, as I lay on the stairs, gathering my strength in an effort to crawl back to my room, Debbie walked by the top of the staircase. She caught sight of me and stopped. I raised my head to call her name, but again I could only form a choked croak.</p><p>\"Declan?\" Debbie asked, taking a step forward. \"What are you doing? You haven't been drinking again, have you?\"</p><p>I frowned. Why had she confused me with Declan? We looked nothing alike.</p><p>As Debbie climbed down to help, she realized I wasn't the tramp. She stopped, coming on guard. \"Who are you?\" she snapped. \"What are you doing here?\"</p><p>\"It's? me,\" I gasped, but she didn't hear.</p><p>\"Alice!\" Debbie shouted. \"Harkat!\"</p><p>At her cry, Alice and Harkat came running and joined her at the top of the stairs. \"Is it one of Declan or Little Kenny's friends?\" Alice asked.</p><p>\"I don't think so,\" Debbie said.</p><p>\"Who are you?\" Alice challenged me. \"Tell us, quick, or?\"</p><p>\"Wait,\" Harkat interrupted. He stepped past the women and stared hard at me, then grimaced. \"As if we haven't enough? problems!\" He hurried down the steps. \"It's OK,\" he told Alice and Debbie as he picked me up. \"It's Darren.\"</p><p>\"Darren?\" Debbie exclaimed. \"But he's covered in hair!\"</p><p>And I realized why she hadn't recognized me.</p><p>Overnight, my hair had sprouted and I'd grown a beard. \"The purge!\" I wheezed.</p><p>\"The second phase,\" Harkat nodded. \"You know what? this means?\"</p><p>Yes - it meant my time as a half-vampire was almost at an end. Within a few weeks the vampire blood within my veins would transform all of the human cells and I'd become a true, night-hugging, sunlight-fearing creature of the dark.</p><p>I explained the purge to Debbie and Alice. My vampire cells were attacking my human cells, converting them. Within weeks I'd be a full-vampire. In the meantime my body would mature rapidly and undergo all kinds of inconveniences. Apart from the hair, my senses would go haywire. I'd suffer headaches. I'd have to cover my eyes and plug up my nose and ears. My sense of taste would desert me. I'd experience sudden bursts of energy then loss of strength.</p><p>\"It's terrible timing,\" I complained to Debbie later in the day. Harkat and Alice were busy elsewhere in the house while Debbie helped me cut my hair and shave.</p><p>\"What's so bad about it?\" she asked.</p><p>\"I'm vulnerable,\" I said. \"My head's pounding. I can't see, hear or smell right. I don't know what my body's going to do from one minute to the next. If we get into a fight with the vampaneze any time soon, I can't be depended upon.\"</p><p>\"But you're stronger than normal during the purge, aren't you?\"</p><p>\"Sometimes. But that strength can dwindle away suddenly, leaving me weak and defenceless. And there's no way of predicting when that will happen.\"</p><p>\"What about afterwards?\" Debbie asked, trimming my fringe. \"You'll be a full-vampire?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"You'll be able to flit and communicate telepathically with other vampires?\"</p><p>\"Not straightaway,\" I told her. \"The ability will be there, but I'll have to develop it. I've got a lot of learning to do over the next few years.\"</p><p>\"You don't sound too happy about it,\" Debbie noted.</p><p>I pulled a face. \"In many ways I'm glad - I'll finally be a true vampire, as a Prince should be. I've always felt awkward, being a half-vampire and having so much power. On the other hand I'm facing the end of a way of life. No more sunlight or being able to pass for human. I've enjoyed the best of both worlds since I was blooded. Now I have to leave one of them - the human world - behind for ever.\" I sighed moodily.</p><p>Debbie thought about that in silence, cutting my hair back. Then she said quietly, \"You'll be an adult at the end, won't you?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I snorted. \"That's another change I'm not sure about. I've been a child or teenager for the better part of thirty years. To leave that behind in the space of a few weeks? It's weird!\"</p><p>\"But wonderful,\" Debbie said. She stopped cutting and stepped in front of me. \"Do you remember when you tried to kiss me a few years ago?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I grimaced. \"That's when I was pretending to be a student, and you were my teacher. You hit the roof and ordered me out of your apartment.\"</p><p>\"Rightly so,\" Debbie grinned. \"As a teacher - an adult - it would be wrong of me to get involved with a child. I couldn't kiss you then, and I can't kiss you now. It'd feel terribly wrong kissing a boy.\" Her grin changed subtly, mysteriously. \"But in a few weeks, you won't be a boy. You'll be a man.\"</p><p>\"Oh,\" I said, thinking about that. Then my expression changed. I gazed up at Debbie with new understanding and hope, then gently took her hand.</p><p>Chapter FIFTEEN</p><p>A benefit of the purge was that my wound healed quickly and I got my strength back. A couple of days later, I was almost back to full physical fitness, except for my headaches and growing pains.</p><p>I was doing press-ups on the floor of my bedroom, working off some of my excess energy, when I heard Debbie squeal downstairs. I stopped instantly and shared a worried look with Harkat, who was standing guard by the door. I hurried to his side and removed one of the earplugs I was wearing to block out the worst of the street noises.</p><p>\"Should we go down?\" Harkat asked, opening the door a crack. We could hear Debbie babbling excitedly, and as we listened, Alice joined her and also began to talk very quickly.</p>","<p>\"I don't think anything's wrong,\" I said, frowning. \"They seem happy, as if an old friend has?\" I stopped and slapped my forehead. Harkat laughed, then both of us said at exactly the same time, \"Vancha!\"</p><p>Throwing the door wide open, we barged down the stairs and found Debbie and Alice chatting with a burly, red-skinned, green-haired man, dressed in purple animal hides and no shoes, with belts of sharp throwing stars - shurikens - looped around his torso.</p><p>\"Vancha!\" I shouted happily, clutching his arms and squeezing tight.</p><p>\"It is good to see you again, Sire,\" Vancha said with surprising politeness. Then he burst into a grin and hugged me tight. \"Darren!\" he boomed. \"I've missed you!\" Turning to Harkat, he laughed. \"I missed you too, ugly!\"</p><p>\"Look who's talking!\" Harkat grinned.</p><p>\"It's great to see you both, but of course I'm most pleased to see the ladies,\" Vancha said, releasing me and winking at Debbie and Alice. \"Female beauty's what we hot-blooded men live for, aye?\"</p><p>\"He's a born flatterer,\" Alice sniffed. \"I bet he says that to every woman he meets.\"</p><p>\"Naturally,\" Vancha murmured, \"because all women are beautiful, in one way or another. But you're more beautiful than most, my dear - an angel of the night!\"</p><p>Alice snorted with contempt, but there was a strange little smile playing at the corners of her lips. Vancha looped his arms around Debbie and Alice and guided us into the living room, as though this was his house and we were the guests. Sitting down, making himself comfortable, he told Debbie to go fetch some food. She told him - in no uncertain terms - that he could do his own fetching while he was here, and he laughed with delight.</p><p>It was refreshing to see that the War of the Scars hadn't changed Vancha March. He was as loud and lively as ever. He filled us in on his recent movements, the countries he'd explored, the vampaneze and vampets he'd killed, making it sound like a big, exciting adventure, free from all consequences.</p><p>\"When I heard that Leonard was here, I came as quickly as I could,\" Vancha concluded. \"I flitted without rest. I haven't missed him, have I?\"</p><p>\"We don't know,\" I said. \"We haven't heard from him since the night he almost killed me.\"</p><p>\"But what does your heart tell you?\" Vancha asked, his large eyes weighing heavy upon me, his small mouth closed in a tight, expectant line.</p><p>\"He's here,\" I said softly. \"He's waiting for me - forus . I think this is where Mr Tiny's prophecy will be tested. We'll face him on these streets - or beneath - and we'll kill him or he'll kill us. And that will be the end of the War of the Scars. Except?\"</p><p>\"What?\" Vancha asked when I didn't continue.</p><p>\"There was supposed to be one final encounter. Four times our path was due to cross with his. When he had me at his mercy recently, that was the fourth time, but we're both still alive. Maybe Mr Tiny got it wrong. Maybe his prophecy doesn't hold true any longer.\"</p><p>Vancha mulled that one over. \"Perhaps you have a point,\" he said uncertainly. \"But as much as I despise Des Tiny, I have to admit he doesn't make many mistakes when it comes to prophecies - in fact none that I've heard of. He told youwe would have four chances to kill Leonard, aye?\" I nodded. \"Then maybe we both have to be there. Perhaps your solo encounter doesn't count.\"</p><p>\"It would have counted if he'd killed me,\" I grunted.</p><p>\"But he didn't,\" Vancha said. \"Maybe he couldn't. Perhaps it simply wasn't his destiny.\"</p><p>\"If you're right, that means we're going to run into him again,\" I said.</p><p>\"Aye,\" Vancha said. \"A fight to the death. Except if he wins, he won't kill both of us. Evanna said one of us would survive if we lost.\" Evanna was a witch, the daughter of Mr Tiny. I'd almost forgotten that part of the prophecy. If Steve won, he'd leave one of us alive, to witness the downfall of the clan.</p><p>There was a long, troubled silence as we thought about the prophecy and the dangers we faced. Vancha broke it by clapping loudly. \"Enough of the doom and gloom! What about you two?\" He nodded at Harkat and me. \"How did your quest go? Do we know who Harkat used to be?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Harkat said. He glanced at Debbie and Alice. \"I don't wish to be rude, but could you? leave us alone for a while?\"</p><p>\"Is thismen's talk?\" Alice asked mockingly.</p><p>\"No,\" Harkat chuckled. \"It'sPrince's talk.\"</p><p>\"We'll be upstairs,\" Debbie said. \"Call us when you're ready.\"</p><p>Vancha stood and bowed as the ladies were leaving. When he sat again, his expression was curious. \"Why the secrecy?\" he asked.</p><p>\"It's about who I was,\" Harkat said, \"and where? we learnt the truth. We don't think we should discuss it? in front of anybody except a Prince.\"</p><p>\"Intriguing,\" Vancha said, leaning forward eagerly.</p><p>We gave Vancha a quick rundown of our quest through the wastelands, the creatures we'd battled, meeting Evanna, the mad sailor - Spits Abrams - and the dragons. He said nothing, but listened enthralled. When we told him about pulling Kurda Smahlt out of the Lake of Souls, Vancha's jaw dropped.</p><p>\"But it can't be!\" he protested. \"Harkat was alive before Kurda died.\"</p><p>\"Mr Tiny can move through time,\" I said. \"He created Harkat from Kurda's remains, then took him into the past, so that he could serve as my protector.\"</p><p>Vancha blinked slowly. Then his features clouded over with rage - and fear. \"Damn that Desmond Tiny! I always knew he was powerful, but to be able to meddle with time itself? What manner of diabolical beast is he?\"</p><p>It was a rhetorical question, so we didn't attempt to answer it. Instead we finished by telling him how Kurda had chosen to sacrifice himself - he and Harkat shared a soul, so only one of them could live at any given time - leaving us free to return to the present.</p><p>\"Thepresent ?\" Vancha snapped. \"What do you mean?\"</p><p>Harkat told him about our theory - that the wasteworld was the future. When he heard that, Vancha trembled as though a cold wind had sliced through him. \"I never thought the War of the Scars could be that crucial,\" he said softly. \"I knew our future was at stake, but I never dreamt we could drag humanity down with us.\" He shook his head and turned away, muttering, \"I need to think about this.\"</p>","<p>Harkat and I said nothing while Vancha deliberated. Minutes passed. A quarter of an hour. Half an hour. Finally he heaved a large sigh and turned to face us. \"These are grim tidings,\" he said. \"But perhaps not as grim as they seem. From what you've told me, I believe that Tiny did take you into the future - but I also believe he wouldn't have done so without good reason. He might have been simply mocking you, but it might also have been a warning.</p><p>\"That damned future must be what we face if we lose the War of the Scars. Steve Leonard is the sort who'd level the world and bring it to ruin. But if we win, we can prevent that. When Tiny came to Vampire Mountain, he told us there were two possible futures, didn't he? One where the vampaneze win the war, and one where the vampires win. I think Tiny gave you a glimpse of the former future to drive home the point that wehave to win this war. It's not just ourselves we're fighting for - it's the entire world. The wasteworld is one future - I'm sure the world where we've won is completely different.\"</p><p>\"It makes sense,\" Harkat agreed. \"If both futures currently exist? he might have been able to choose which? to take us to.\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\" I sighed, unconvinced. I was thinking again about the vision I'd had shortly after we'd first met Evanna, when Harkat had been plagued by nightmares. Evanna helped me put a stop to them, by sending me into his dreams. In the dream, I'd faced a being of immense power - the Lord of the Shadows. Evanna told me this master of evil was part of the future, and the road there was paved with dead souls. She'd also told me that could be one of two people - Steve Leopard orme .</p><p>The uncertainties came rushing back. I was unable to share Vancha and Harkat's view that one future was bright and cheery where the other was dark and miserable. I felt we were heading for big-scale trouble, whichever way the War of the Scars swung. But I kept my opinions to myself - I didn't want to come across as a prophetof doom. \"So!\" Vancha laughed, startling me out of my dark thoughts. \"We just have to make sure we kill Steve Leonard, aye?\"</p><p>\"Aye,\" I said, grinning sickly.</p><p>\"What about me?\" Harkat asked. \"Does it alter your opinion of me? now that you know I was once a vampire traitor?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Vancha said. \"I never liked you much anyway.\" He spat into his right palm, ran the spit through his hair, then winked to show he was joking. \"Seriously, you were right not to broadcast the news. We'll keep it to ourselves. I always believed that although Kurda acted stupidly, he acted with the best interests of the clan at heart. But there are many who don't share that view. If they knew the truth about you, it might divide them. Internal argument is the last thing we need. That'd be playing straight into the hands of the vampaneze.</p><p>\"As for who Harkat is now?\" Vancha studied the Little Person. \"I know you and trust you. I believe you've learnt from Kurda's faults. You won't betray us again, will you, Harkat?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Harkat said softly. \"But I'm still in favour of a treaty? between the two clans. If I can help bring that about through peaceful? means, by talking, I will. This War of the Scars is destroying? both families of the night, and it threatens to destroy? even more.\"</p><p>\"But you recognize the need to fight?\" Vancha said sharply.</p><p>\"I recognize the need to kill Steve? Leonard,\" Harkat said. \"After that, I'll push for peace? if I can. But openly - no plotting or intrigue? this time.\"</p><p>Vancha considered that in silence, then shrugged. \"So be it. I've nothing personal against the vampaneze. If we kill Leonard and they agree to a truce, I'm all for it. Now,\" he continued, scratching his chin, \"where do you think Leonard's holed up?\"</p><p>\"Probably somewhere deep underground,\" I said.</p><p>\"You think he's preparing a grand-scale trap, like before?\" Vancha asked.</p><p>\"No,\" Harkat said. \"Vampaneze have been active here. That's why Debbie and Alice came. But if there were dozens of them, like? the last time, the death count would be higher. I don't think Steve has as many? vampaneze with him as when we faced him? in the Cavern of Retribution.\"</p><p>\"I hope you're right,\" Vancha said. He glanced at me sideways. \"How did my brother look?\" Vancha and Gannen Harst were estranged brothers.</p><p>\"Tired,\" I said. \"Strained. Unhappy.\"</p><p>\"Not hard to imagine why,\" Vancha grunted. \"I'll never understand why Gannen and the others follow a maniac like Leonard. The vampaneze were content the way they were. They didn't seek to crush the vampires or provoke a war. It makes no sense for them to flock to that demon and pledge themselves to him.\"</p><p>\"It's part of Mr Tiny's prophecy,\" Harkat said. \"As Kurda, I spent much time with? the vampaneze, researching their ways. You know about their Coffin of Fire. When a person lies within, it fills? with flames. All normal people die in it. Only the Lord of the Vampaneze? can survive. Mr Tiny told the vampaneze that if they didn't? obey that person and do all that he commanded, they'd? be wiped from the face of the earth. Most of the vampaneze fight to preserve themselves? not to destroy the vampires.\"</p><p>Vancha nodded slowly. \"Then they're motivated by fear for their lives, not hatred of us. I understand now. . After all, isn't that why we're fighting too - to save ourselves?\"</p><p>\"Both fighting for the same reason,\" Harkat chuckled humourlessly. \"Both terrified of the? same thing. Of course, if neither side fought? both would be safe. Mr Tiny is playing the creatures of the night? for fools, and we're helping him.\"</p><p>\"Aye,\" Vancha grunted disgustedly. \"But there's no use moaning about how we got ourselves into this sorry state. The fact is, we fight because we must.\"</p><p>Vancha stood and stretched. There were dark rims around his eyes. He looked like a man who hadn't slept properly for a very long time. The last two years must have been tough for him. Although he hadn't mentioned Mr Crepsley, I was sure the dead vampire was never far from his thoughts. Vancha, like I, probably felt a certain amount of guilt - the two of us had given Mr Crepsley the go-ahead to face the Vampaneze Lord. If either of us had taken his place, he'd be alive now. It looked to me like Vancha had been pushing himself to his limits in his hunt to find the Lord of the Vampaneze - and was rapidly nearing them.</p><p>\"You should rest, Sire,\" I said. \"If you flitted all the way here, you must be exhausted.\"</p>","<p>\"I'll rest when Leonard is dead,\" Vancha grunted. \"Or myself,\" he added softly, under his breath. I don't think he realized he'd spoken aloud. \"Now!\" Vancha said, raising his voice. \"Enough self-pity and misery. We're here and Leonard's here - it doesn't take a genius to see that an old-fashioned scrap to the death's on the agenda. The question is, do we wait for him to come to us, or do we seize the initiative and go looking for him?\"</p><p>\"We wouldn't know where? to look,\" Harkat said. \"He could be anywhere.\"</p><p>\"So we look everywhere,\" Vancha grinned. \"But where do we start? Darren?\"</p><p>\"His son,\" I said immediately. \"Darius is an unusual name. There can't be too many of them. We ask around, find out where he lives, track Steve through him.\"</p><p>\"Use the son to get to the father,\" Vancha hummed. \"Ignoble, but probably the best way.\" He paused. \"The boy worries me. Leonard's a nasty piece of work, a formidable foe. But if his son has the same evil blood, and has been trained in Leonard's wicked ways since birth, he could be even worse!\"</p><p>\"I agree,\" I said quietly.</p><p>\"Can you kill a child, Darren?\" Vancha asked.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" I said, unable to meet his eyes. \"I don't think so. Hopefully it won't come to that.\"</p><p>\"It's no good hoping,\" Harkat objected. \"Going after the boy is wrong. Just because Steve has no morals doesn't? mean we should act like savages too. Children should be kept out? of this.\"</p><p>\"So what's your suggestion?\" Vancha asked.</p><p>\"We should return to the? Cirque Du Freak,\" Harkat said. \"Hibernius might be able to tell us more? about what we should do. Even if he's unable to help, Steve knows? where the Cirque is camped. He'll find us there. We can wait for him.\"</p><p>\"I don't like the idea of being a sitting target,\" Vancha growled.</p><p>\"You'd rather chase children?\" Harkat countered.</p><p>Vancha stiffened, then relaxed. \"Perhaps no-ears has a point,\" he said. \"It can certainly do no harm to ask Hibernius for his opinion.\"</p><p>\"OK,\" I said. \"But we'll wait for night - my eyes can't take the sun.\"</p><p>\"So that's why your ears and nose are stuffed!\" Vancha laughed. \"The purge?\"</p><p>\"Yes. It struck a couple of days ago.\"</p><p>\"Will you be able to pull your weight,\" Vancha asked directly, \"or should we wait for it to pass?\"</p><p>\"I'll do my best,\" I said. \"I can't make any guarantees, but I think I'll be OK.\"</p><p>\"Very well.\" Vancha nodded at the ceiling. \"What about the ladies? Do we tell them what we're up to?\"</p><p>\"Not all of it,\" I said. \"We'll take them to the Cirque Du Freak and tell them we're hunting Steve. But let's not mention Darius - Debbie wouldn't think much of our plan to use a child.\"</p><p>Harkat snorted but said nothing. After that we called Debbie and Alice down and spent a peaceful afternoon eating, drinking and talking, swapping tales, laughing, relaxing. I noticed Vancha glancing around during quiet moments, as though looking for somebody. I dismissed it at the time, but I now know who he was looking for ?death. Of us all, only Vancha sensed death in the room that day, its eternal gaze passing from one of us to the other, watching? waiting? choosing.</p><p>Chapter SIXTEEN</p><p>When night fell, we departed. Declan andLittle Kenny bid us farewell. They were settling down in the living room, mobile phones laid in front of them like swords. Debbie and Alice's vampirites had been scouring the town for traces of Steve and the other vampaneze since the massacre in the stadium. Declan and Little Kenny were to coordinate that search in the ladies' absence.</p><p>\"You have our numbers,\" Alice said to Declan as we were leaving. \"Call if you have anything to report, no matter how trivial it might seem.\"</p><p>\"Will do,\" Declan grinned, saluting clumsily.</p><p>\"Try not to get yourself shot this time,\" Little Kenny said to me, winking.</p><p>Alice and Debbie had a rented van. We piled in, Harkat and Vancha in the back, covered by several blankets. \"If we're stopped and searched, you two will have to break free,\" Alice told them. \"We'll act like we didn't know you were there. It'll be easier that way.\"</p><p>\"You mean you'll act the innocent and string us out to dry,\" Vancha grunted.</p><p>\"Exactly,\" Alice said.</p><p>Even though it was night and the moon was only half-full, I wore sunglasses. My eyes were especially sensitive that night, and I had a splitting headache. I was also wearing earplugs and had little balls of cotton wool stuffed up my nose.</p><p>\"Maybe you should stay behind,\" Debbie said, noting my discomfort as Alice switched on the engine.</p><p>\"I'm OK,\" I groaned, squinting against the glare of the headlights, wincing at the roaring grumble of the engine.</p><p>\"We could walk,\" Alice said, \"but we're more likely to be stopped and searched.\"</p><p>\"I'm OK,\" I said again, hunching down in my seat. \"Just don't blow the horn.\"</p><p>The drive to the old football stadium where the Cirque Du Freak was encamped was uneventful. We passed two security checkpoints, but were waved through at each. (I took my glasses off and removed the earplugs and cotton wool as we approached, so as not to arouse suspicion.) Alice parked outside the stadium. We let Harkat and Vancha out of the back and walked in.</p><p>A big smile broke across my face as the tents and caravans came into sight - it was good to be home. As we exited the tunnel and made for the campsite, we were spotted by a group of children playing on the outskirts.</p><p>One stood, studied us warily, then raced towards us, yelling, \"Godfather! Godfather!\"</p><p>\"Not so loud!\" I laughed, catching Shancus as he leapt up to greet me. I gave the snake-boy awelcome hug, then pushed him away - my skin was tingling as a result of the purge, and any form of contact was irritating.</p><p>\"Why are you wearing sunglasses?\" Shancus frowned. \"It's night.\"</p><p>\"You're so ugly, I can't bear to look at you without protection,\" I said.</p><p>\"Very funny,\" he snorted, then reached up, picked the cotton wool out of my left nostril, examined it, stuck it back in, and said, \"You're weird!\" He looked behind me at Vancha, Debbie and Alice. \"I remember you lot,\" he said. \"But not very well. I was only a kid the last time I saw you.\" Smiling, I made the introductions. \"Oh yeah,\" Shancus said when I told him Debbie's name. \"You're Darren's bird.\"</p>","<p>I spluttered with embarrassment and blushed bright red. Debbie just smiled and said, \"Am I, indeed? Who told you that?\"</p><p>\"I heard Mum and Dad talking about you. Dad knows you from when you first met Darren. He said Darren goes googly-eyed when you're around. He?\"</p><p>\"That's enough,\" I interrupted, wishing I could strangle him. \"Why don't you show the ladies how you can stick your tongue up your nose?\"</p><p>That distracted him, and he spent a couple of minutes showing off, telling Alice and Debbie about the act he performed on-stage with Evra. I caught Debbie smiling at me sideways. I smiled back weakly.</p><p>\"Is Truska still with the show?\" Vancha asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Shancus said.</p><p>\"I must look her up later,\" Vancha muttered, using a ball of spit to slick back his green hair. The ugly, dirty Prince fancied himself as something of a lady's man - even though no ladies ever agreed with him!</p><p>\"Is Mr Tall in his van?\" Harkat asked Shancus.</p><p>\"I guess,\" Shancus said. Then he glanced at Debbie and Alice and straightened up. \"Come with me,\" he said officiously. \"I'll lead you to him.\"</p><p>All five of us fell in behind the snake-boy as he led us through the campsite. He kept up a running commentary, telling Debbie and Alice who the various tents and caravans belonged to, giving them a rundown of that night's coming show. As we neared Mr Tall's van, we passed Evra, Merla and Urcha. They had the family snakes out in big tubs of water and were carefully scrubbing them down. Evra was delighted to see me and rushed over to check that I was all right. \"I wanted to come visit,\" he said, \"but Hibernius told me it wasn't a good idea. He said I might be followed.\"</p><p>\"The Cirque's being watched?\" Vancha snapped, eyes narrowing.</p><p>\"He didn't say so in as many words,\" Evra said. \"But I've felt eyes on my back a few times recently, late at night when I've been wandering around. I'm not the only one. We've all been edgy here lately.\"</p><p>\"Maybe we shouldn't have? come back,\" Harkat said, worried.</p><p>\"Too late now,\" Vancha huffed. \"Let's go see what Hibernius has to say.\"</p><p>Merla grabbed Shancus as he made to lead the way again. \"No you don't,\" she said. \"You've a show to prepare for. You needn't expect me to groom your snake for you every time you want to go and play with your friends.\"</p><p>\"Aw, Mum!\" Shancus grumbled, but Merla stuck a sponge in Shancus's hand and dragged him over to the snake I'd bought for his birthday.</p><p>\"I'll catch up with you later,\" I laughed, feeling sorry for him. \"I'll show you my new scar, where I was shot.\"</p><p>\"Another one?\" Shancus groaned. He turned appealingly to Evra. \"How come Darren gets all the excitement? Why can'tI get into fights and have scars?\"</p><p>\"Your mother will scar your backside if you don't get busy on that snake,\" Evra responded, and winked at me over Shancus's head. \"Drop by when you have time.\"</p><p>\"I will,\" I promised.</p><p>We moved on. Mr Tall was waiting for us at his van. He was standing in the doorway, looking more impossibly towering than ever, eyes dark, face drawn. \"I have been expecting you,\" he sighed, then stood aside and beckoned us in. As I passed him, a strange shiver ran down my spine. It took me a few seconds to realize what the sensation reminded me of - it was the same sort of feeling I got whenever I saw a dead person.</p><p>When we were all seated, Mr Tall closed the door, then sat on the floor in the middle of us, legs crossed neatly, huge bony hands resting on his knees. \"I hope you do not think me rude for not visiting,\" he said to me. \"I knew you would recover, and I had much to put in order here.\"</p><p>\"That's OK,\" I smiled, taking off my sunglasses and putting them to one side.</p><p>\"It is good to see you again, Vancha,\" Mr Tall said, and then welcomed Debbie and Alice.</p><p>\"Now that the pleasantries are out of the way,\" Vancha grunted, \"let's get down to business. You knew what was going to happen at the football arena, aye?\"</p><p>\"I had my suspicions,\" Mr Tall said cagily, his lips barely moving.</p><p>\"But you let Darren go regardless? You let his friend die?\"</p><p>\"I did not 'let' anything happen,\" Mr Tall disagreed. \"Events unfolded the way they had to. It is not my place to interfere in the unravelling of destiny. You know that, Vancha. We have had this conversation before. Several times.\"</p><p>\"And I still don't buy it,\" Vancha grumbled. \"IfI had the power to see into the future, I'd use it to help those I cared about. You could have told us who the Lord of the Vampaneze was. Larten would be alive now if you'd warned us in advance.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Mr Tall said. \"Larten would have died. The circumstances might have differed, but his death was inevitable. I could not have altered that.\"</p><p>\"You should still have tried,\" Vancha persisted.</p><p>Mr Tall smiled thinly, then looked at me. \"You have come to seek guidance. You wish to know where your onetime friend, Steve Leonard, is.\"</p><p>\"Can you tell us?\" I asked softly.</p><p>\"No,\" Mr Tall said. \"But rest assured, he will make himself known soon. You will not have to dredge the depths for him.\"</p><p>\"Does that mean he's going to attack?\" Vancha pressed. \"Is he nearby? When does he plan to strike? Where?\"</p><p>\"I grow weary of your questions,\" Mr Tall growled, his eyes flashing menacingly. \"If I could step in and play an active part in the affairs of the vampire clan, I would. It is much harder to stand back and watch, passively. Harder than you could ever imagine. You wept for Larten when he died - butI grieved for him for thirty years in advance, since glimpsing his probable death.\"</p><p>\"You mean 'you didn't know for? sure that he'd die?\" Harkat asked.</p><p>\"I knew he would come to the point where it was his life or the Lord of the Vampaneze's, but I could not see beyond that - though I feared the worst.\"</p><p>\"And what of our next encounter?\" I asked quietly. \"When Vancha and I face Steve for the last time - who'll die then?\"</p><p>\"I do not know,\" Mr Tall said. \"Looking into the future is more often than not a painful experience. It is better not to know the fate of your friends and loved ones. I lift the lid off the present as seldom as possible. There are times when I cannot avoid it, when my own destiny forces me to look. But only rarely.\"</p>","<p>\"So you don't know if we'll win or lose?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Nobody knows that,\" Mr Tall said. \"Not even Desmond Tiny.\"</p><p>\"Butif we lose,\" I said, and there was an edge to my voice now. \"If the vampaneze are triumphant, and Steve kills one of us - which will it be?\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" Mr Tall said.</p><p>\"But you could find out,\" I pressed. \"You could look into the future where we've lost and see which of us survived.\"</p><p>\"Why should I?\" Mr Tall sighed. \"What profit would there be in it?\"</p><p>\"I want to know,\" I insisted.</p><p>\"Maybe it would be better?\" Vancha began to say.</p><p>\"No!\" I hissed. \"Imust know. For two years I've dreamt of the destruction of the clan, and listened to the screams of those who'll perish if we fail. If I'm to die, so be it. But tell me, please, so I can prepare myself for it.\"</p><p>\"I cannot,\" Mr Tall said unhappily. \"Nobody can predict which of you will kill the Vampaneze Lord - or die at his hand.\"</p><p>\"Then look further ahead,\" I pleaded. \"Go twenty years ahead, or thirty. Do you see Vancha or me in that future?\"</p><p>\"Leave me out of this.'\" Vancha snapped. \"I don't want to mess about with stuff like that.\"</p><p>\"Then just look for me,\" I said, staring hard at Mr Tall.</p><p>Mr Tall held my gaze, then said quietly, \"You are sure?\"</p><p>I stiffened. \"Yes!\"</p><p>\"Very well.\" Mr Tall lowered his gaze and closed his eyes. \"I cannot be as specific as you state, but I will cast my eyes a number of decades forward and?\"</p><p>Mr Tall trailed off into silence. Vancha, Harkat, Debbie, Alice and I watched, awed, as his face twitched and glowed a light red colour. The owner of the Cirque Du Freak seemed to stop breathing and the temperature of the air dropped several degrees. For five minutes he held that pose, face glowing and twitching, lips sealed. Then he breathed out, the glow faded, his eyes opened and the temperature returned to normal.</p><p>\"I have looked,\" he said, his expression unreadable.</p><p>\"And?\" I croaked.</p><p>\"I did not find you there.\"</p><p>I smiled bitterly. \"I knew it. If the clan falls, it will fall because ofme . I'm the doomed one in the future where we lose.\"</p><p>\"Not necessarily,\" Mr Tall said. \"I looked fifty or sixty years ahead, long after the fall of the vampires. You might have died after all of the others had been killed.\"</p><p>\"Then bring it forward,\" I demanded. \"Look twenty or thirty years ahead.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Mr Tall said stiffly. \"I have already seen more than I wished. I don't want to suffer any further tonight.\"</p><p>\"What are you talking about?\" I huffed. \"What have you suffered?\"</p><p>\"Grief,\" Mr Tall said. He paused, then glanced at Vancha. \"I know you told me not to look for you, old friend, but I couldn't help myself.\"</p><p>Vancha cursed, then braced himself. \"Go on. Since this fool's opened the can of worms, we might as well watch them wriggle. Hit me with the bad news.\"</p><p>\"I looked into both futures,\" Mr Tall said hollowly. \"I did not mean to, but I cannot control these things. I looked into the future where the vampaneze won the War of the Scars, and also into the future where the vampires won - and although I found Darren in the latter future, I found you in neither.\" He locked gazes with Vancha and muttered gloomily, \"You were killed by in both.\"</p><p>Chapter SEVENTEEN</p><p>Vancha blinked slowly. \"You're saying I'll die whether we win or lose?\" His voice was surprisingly steady.</p><p>\"is destined to destroy you,\" Mr Tall replied. \"I cannot say when or how it happens, but it will.\"</p><p>\"Who's this Lord of the Shadows?\" Harkat asked. I was the only person who'd been told about him. Evanna had warned me not to speak of it to anybody else.</p><p>\"He's the cruel leader who will ruin the world after the War of the Scars,\" Mr Tall said.</p><p>\"I don't get it,\" Harkat grumbled. \"If we kill Steve, then there won't be a? Lord of the bloody Shadows.\"</p><p>\"Oh, but there will,\" Mr Tall said. \"The world is set to produce a monster of unimaginable power and fury. His coming is unavoidable. Only his identity is yet to be determined - and that will be decided shortly.\"</p><p>\"The wasteworld,\" Harkat said sickly. \"You mean, even if we kill Steve, that's what? the future will be? The desolate land where Darren and I found? out the truth about me - that's what lies? in store?\"</p><p>Mr Tall hesitated, then nodded. \"I could not tell you before. I have never spoken of matters such as this in the past. But we are at the time where no harm can come of revealing it, since nothing can be done to avert it. is upon us - within twenty-four hours he will be born, and all the world will tremble at his coming.\"</p><p>There was a long, stunned silence. Vancha, Harkat, Debbie and Alice were filled with confusion, especially the latter pair, who knew nothing of the wasteworld of the future.I was filled with fear. This was confirmation of all my worst nightmares. would rise regardless of what happened in the War of the Scars. And not only could I not prevent his coming - in one of the futures, I wouldbe him. Which meant, if we won the war, at some stage in the next fifty or sixty years, along with all the other lives I'd ruin, I would kill Vancha too. It seemed impossible. It sounded like a sick joke. But Evanna and Mr Tall both had the gift of reading the future - and both had told me the same thing.</p><p>\"Let me get this straight,\" Vancha growled, breaking the silence and disrupting my train of thought. \"No matter what happens between us and Steve Leonard - or in the war with the vampaneze - a Lord of the Shadows is going to come along and destroy the world?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Mr Tall said. \"Humans are soon to lose control of this planet. The reins of power will be handed over. This is written. What remains to be seen is whether the reins pass to a vampaneze or? to a vampire.\" He didn't look at me when he said that. It might have been my imagination, but I got the feeling he had deliberately avoided making eye contact with me.</p><p>\"But regardless of who wins, I'm for the chop?\" Vancha pressed.</p><p>\"Yes.\" Mr Tall smiled. \"But do not fear death, Vancha, for it comes for us all.\" His smile dimmed. \"For some of us, it comes very soon.\"</p>","<p>\"What are you talking about?\" Vancha snapped. \"You're not part of this. No vampire or vampaneze would raise a hand against you.\"</p><p>\"That might be true,\" Mr Tall chuckled, \"but there are others in this world who do not hold me in such high esteem.\" He cocked his head sideways and his expression mellowed. \"And to prove my point?\"</p><p>A woman screamed. We all sprang to our feet and rushed to the door, except Mr Tall, who slowly rose behind us.</p><p>Alice was first to the door. Flinging it open, she dived out, drew a gun, rolled when she hit the ground, then came to her knees. Vancha was next. He leapt out, pulling a couple of shurikens free, jumping high to launch them from a height if he had to. I was third. I had no weapons, so I sprang over to where Alice was, guessing she'd be able to supply me with something. Harkat and Debbie moved at the same time, Harkat brandishing his axe, Debbie pulling a pistol like Alice's. Behind them, Mr Tall stood in the doorway, gazing up at the sky. Then he stepped down.</p><p>There was nobody in sight, but we heard another scream, this time a child's. Then a man gave a shout of panic - it was Evra.</p><p>\"A weapon!\" I yelled at Alice as she got to her feet. With one hand she reached down and produced a short hunting knife from a pouch on her left leg.</p><p>\"Stay behind me,\" Alice commanded, homing in on the screams. \"Vancha to my left, Debbie and Harkat to my right.\"</p><p>We obeyed the ex-chief inspector, fanned out and advanced. I could sense Mr Tall following, but I didn't look back.</p><p>A woman screamed again - Merla, Evra's wife.</p><p>People spilt out of the caravans and tents around us, performers and staff, eager to help. Mr Tall roared at them to keep out of this. His voice was thunderous and they quickly bolted back inside. I glanced over my shoulder, stunned by his fierceness. He smiled apologetically. \"This is our fight, not theirs,\" he said by way of explanation.</p><p>The \"our\" surprised me - was Mr Tall finally abandoning his neutrality? - but I hadn't time to dwell upon it. Ahead of me, Alice had cleared the end of a tent and come into sight of the disturbance. A second later, I was on the scene too.</p><p>The Vons - except Lilia, who wasn't present - were under attack. Their assailants - R.V., Morgan James and Steve Leopard's son, Darius! R.V. had killed Evra's snake and was in the process of chopping up Shancus's. Evra was fighting with the hook-handed madman, trying to drag him off. Shancus was in a wrestling lock with Darius. Merla had hold of Urcha, who was gripping his snake for dear life, sobbing pitifully. They were backing away from Morgan James. He was following slowly, smiling a jagged half-faced smile, red circles of blood highlighting his evil little eyes. The nose of his rifle was aimed at Merla's stomach.</p><p>Vancha reacted quickest. He sent a shuriken flying at Morgan James's rifle, knocking it off-target. James's finger tightened on the trigger at the contact and the rifle exploded - but the bullet shot wide. Before he could fire again, Merla released Urcha, ripped her right ear loose, and sent it flying at James's face. The ear struck him between the eyes and he fell back, grunting with surprise.</p><p>Alerted to our presence, R.V. knocked Evra out of the way and drove after Shancus. He grabbed him from Darius and held him up, laughing, daring us to risk the snake-boy's life.</p><p>\"I don't have a clear shot!\" Alice yelled.</p><p>\"I've got Morgan James covered!\" Debbie shouted back.</p><p>\"Then take him out!\" Alice roared.</p><p>\"The boy dies if you hurt Morgan!\" R.V. retorted, pressing the three blades of his hookedleft hand up into the scaly flesh of Shancus's throat. Shancus either didn't realize the danger he was in, or didn't care, because he kept kicking and punching R.V. But we saw the killer's intent and paused.</p><p>\"Let him go, Hooky,\" Vancha snarled, moving ahead of the rest of us, hands spread wide. \"I'll fight you man to man.\"</p><p>\"You're no man,\" R.V. replied scornfully. \"You're scum, like all your race. Morgan! Are you OK?\"</p><p>\"Uh'm fuhn,\" Morgan James groaned. He picked up his rifle and aimed it at Merla again.</p><p>\"Not this time!\" Harkat shouted, stepping in front of Merla and swinging at James with his axe. James leapt clear of the deadly blade. Across from him, Darius drew a small arrow-gun and fired at Harkat. But he fired too hastily and the arrow flew high of its mark.</p><p>I threw myself at Darius, meaning to grab and hold him, as R.V. was holding Shancus. But Shancus's snake was thrashing wildly in its death throes, and I tripped over it before I could bring my hands together around Darius's throat. Flying forward, I crashed into Evra, who was rushing to his son's aid. We both fell over, wrapped in the dying snake's coils.</p><p>During the confusion, Morgan James and Darius regrouped around R.V.</p><p>Alice, Debbie, Harkat and Vancha hung back, unable to pursue them for fear that R.V. would kill Shancus.</p><p>\"Let him go!\" Merla screamed, eyes filled with tears of desperation.</p><p>\"Make me!\" R.V. jeered.</p><p>\"You can't get out of here,\" Vancha said as R.V. backed away.</p><p>\"Who's going to stop us?\" R.V. mocked him.</p><p>Evra was back on his feet and he made to run after the retreating trio. R.V. dug his hooks deeper into Shancus's throat. \"No you don't!\" he sang, and Evra froze.</p><p>\"Please,\" Debbie said, lowering her pistol. \"Release the boy and we'll let you leave unharmed.\"</p><p>\"You're in no position to make deals,\" R.V. laughed.</p><p>\"What do you want?\" I shouted.</p><p>\"The snake-boy,\" R.V. giggled.</p><p>\"He's no good to you.\" I took a determined step forward. \"Take me instead. I'll swap for Shancus.\"</p><p>I expected R.V. to leap at my offer, but he only shook his head slyly, red eyes shining. \"Stuff it, Shan,\" he said. \"We're taking the boy. If you get in our way, he dies.\"</p><p>I glanced around at my allies - nobody was reacting. The vampaneze had us in a bind. Vancha could move with the speed of a full-vampire, and Debbie and Alice both had guns. But R.V. could kill Shancus before any of us could stop him.</p><p>R.V., Morgan James and Darius continued to back away. R.V. and James were grinning, but Darius looked the same way he'd looked after shooting me - scared and slightly sickened.</p><p>Then, as the rest of us hesitated, Mr Tall spoke. \"I cannot allow this.\"</p><p>R.V. paused uncertainly. \"This is none of your business!\" he shouted. \"Keep your nose out of it.\"</p>","<p>\"You have made it my business,\" Mr Tall disagreed quietly. \"This is my home. These are my people. I must intervene.\"</p><p>\"Don't be a?\" R.V. yelled, but before he got any further, Mr Tall was upon him. He moved at a supernatural speed which even a vampire couldn't match. In less than a flash of an eye he was in front of R.V., his hands on the lunatic's hooks. He wrenched them away from Shancus's throat, tore two of the hooks off the left hand, and one off the right.</p><p>\"My hands!\" R.V. screamed in agony, as though the gold and silver hooks were part of his flesh. \"Leave my hands alone, you?\"</p><p>Whatever foul name he shouted was lost in the burst of a gun retort. Morgan James, who'd been standing next to R.V., had jammed the tip of his rifle hard into Mr Tall's ribs and pulled the trigger. A bullet fired down the chamber of the rifle at a merciless speed - then ripped through the ribcage of the defenceless Hibernius Tall!</p><p>Chapter EIGHTEEN</p><p>Mr Tall's midriff erupted in a fountain of dark red blood and white chips of bone. For a moment he stood, gripping R.V.'s hooks, as though nothing had happened. Then he collapsed, blood pumping out of the hole, his stomach torn to shreds.</p><p>R.V. and Darius stared numbly at Mr Tall as he fell. Then Morgan James screamed at them to run. In a ragged unit they fled, R.V. clutching Shancus, James firing wildly at us over his shoulder.</p><p>Nobody followed. Our eyes were all on Mr Tall. He was blinking rapidly, hands exploring the hole in his middle, lips torn back over his small black teeth. I don't think anybody knew how old Mr Tall was, or where he'd come from. But he was older than any vampire, a being of immense magic and power. It was mind-boggling to think that he could have been brought low in so simple and violent a manner.</p><p>Debbie snapped to her senses first and rushed towards Mr Tall, dropping her pistol, meaning to go to his aid. The rest of us took a step after her?</p><p>?and stopped instantly when somebody spoke from the shadows of a nearby van. \"Your concern is commendable, but utterly worthless. Keep back, please.\"</p><p>A small man waddled forward, smiling glibly. He was dressed in a sharp yellow suit and green Wellington boots. He had white hair, thick glasses, and a heart-shaped watch which he was twirling in his left hand.Desmond Tiny ! Behind him came his daughter, the witch, Evanna - short, muscular, hairy, clad in ropes instead of clothes. She had a small nose, pointed ears, a thin beard, and mismatched eyes, one brown, one green.</p><p>We gawped at the strange pair as they stopped beside the gasping Mr Tall and gazed down at him. Evanna's face was strained. Mr Tiny looked only curious. With his right foot, he nudged Mr Tall where he'd been shot. Mr Tall hissed with pain.</p><p>\"Leave him alone!\" Debbie shouted.</p><p>\"Shut up, please, or I'll kill you,\" Mr Tiny replied. Though he said it sweetly, I've no doubt he would have struck Debbie down dead if she'd said another word. Fortunately, she realized that too, and she held her tongue, trembling.</p><p>\"So, Hibernius,\" Mr Tiny said. \"Your time here comes to an end.\"</p><p>\"You knew it would,\" Mr Tall replied, and his voice was remarkably firm.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Mr Tiny nodded. \"But didyou know?\"</p><p>\"I guessed.\"</p><p>\"You could have turned aside from it. Your fate was never directly linked to these mortals.\"</p><p>\"For me, it was,\" Mr Tall said. He was shivering badly, a dark pool of blood spreading out around him. Evanna took a step aside to avoid the blood, but Mr Tiny let it flow around his boots, staining the soles.</p><p>\"Tiny!\" Vancha snapped. \"Can you save him?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Mr Tiny replied simply. Then he bent over Mr Tall and spread the fingers of his right hand. He placed his middle finger in the centre of Mr Tall's forehead, the adjoining fingers over his eyes, and held the thumb and little finger out at the sides. \"Even in death, may you be triumphant,\" he said with surprising softness then removed his fingers.</p><p>\"Thank you, Father,\" Mr Tall said. He glanced up at Evanna. \"Goodbye, Sister.\"</p><p>\"I will remember you,\" the witch answered as the rest of us looked on, stunned by the revelation. I'd known about Evanna's twin brother, born, as she was, of a union between Mr Tiny and a wolf. I'd just never guessed it was Mr Tall. Evanna bent and kissed her brother's forehead. Mr Tall smiled, then his body shook, his eyes went wide, his neck stiffened - and he died.</p><p>Mr Tiny stood and turned. There was one round tear of blood in the corner of each eye. \"My son is dead,\" he said, in the same tone he'd have used to comment on the weather.</p><p>\"We didn't know!\" Vancha gasped.</p><p>\"He never cared to speak of his parentage.\" Mr Tiny chuckled and kicked the dead Mr Tall's head aside with the heel of his left foot. \"I don't know why.\"</p><p>I growled when he kicked Mr Tall, and started towards him angrily. Harkat and Vancha did the same.</p><p>\"Gentlemen,\" Evanna said quietly. \"If you waste time picking a fight with my father, the killers will escape with the young Von boy.\"</p><p>We stopped short. I'd momentarily forgotten about Shancus and the danger he was in. The others had too. Now that we'd been reminded, we shook our heads and snapped out of our daze.</p><p>\"We have to chase them,\" Vancha said.</p><p>\"But what about Mr Tall?\" Debbie cried.</p><p>\"He's dead,\" Vancha sniffed. \"Let hisfamily care for him.\"</p><p>Mr Tiny laughed at that, but we couldn't afford to pay him any further heed. Grouping together without discussing it, the five of us set off. \"Wait!\" Evra shouted. I looked back and saw him exchange a wordless look with Merla. She half-nodded and he ran after us. \"I'm coming too,\" he said.</p><p>Nobody argued. Accepting Evra into our ranks, we raced away from Merla, Urcha, Mr Tiny, Evanna and the dead Mr Tall, and hurried through the campsite in pursuit of Shancus and his kidnappers.</p><p>As soon as we cleared the tunnel leading out of the stadium, we saw that our quarry had split. To our right,</p><p>R.V. was running away with Shancus, headed into the heart of town. To our left, Morgan James and Darius fled down the hill towards a river which flowed close by the stadium.</p><p>Vancha took charge and made a swift decision. \"Alice and Evra - with me. We'll go after R.V. and Shancus. Darren, Harkat and Debbie - take Morgan James and the boy.\"</p><p>I'd rather have gone to Shancus's rescue, but Vancha was more experienced than me. Nodding obediently, I swung left with Harkat and Debbie and we set off after the killer and his apprentice. My headache had flared up savagely and I was half-blind as I flailed down the hill. Also, the sounds of my feet on the pavement as I ran were torture on my ears. Still, as a half-vampire I could run faster than Harkat or Debbie, and I'd soon pulled ahead and was rapidly closing the gap on Morgan James and Darius.</p>","<p>James and Darius stopped when they heard me coming and spun to face my charge. I should have waited for Harkat and Debbie, rather than face them on my own, armed only with a knife. But rage had taken hold of me. I forged on heedlessly as they fired, James with his rifle, Darius with his arrow-gun. By the luck of the vampires, their bullets and arrows missed, and seconds later I was upon them, wild with fury, intent on revenge.</p><p>James swung at me with the butt of his rifle. It struck my right shoulder, where I'd been shot by Darius. I roared with pain but didn't falter. I stabbed at James with my knife, aiming for his half-mangled face. He ducked, and Darius punched me in the ribs as I slid past. I swatted the boy aside and stabbed at James again. He laughed and grabbed me tight, wrestling me to the ground.</p><p>My face was pressed up close to the left side of Morgan James's head. The skin was wrinkled and red, his teeth exposed behind the thin flesh of his lips, his eye a horrible glob in the middle of a ruined, scarred mess.</p><p>\"Lyhk iht?\" James gurgled.</p><p>\"Lovely!\" I sneered, rolling on top of him, poking for his eyes with my thumbs.</p><p>\"Uh'm gonna duh the shahm tuh yuh!\" James vowed, breaking my grip and driving his knee up into my stomach.</p><p>\"We'll see!\" I grunted, falling away slightly, then coming back at him. I managed to stick my knife in, but only into his arm. I was aware of the boy battering me with his arrow-gun, trying to beat me off. I ignored him and focused on Morgan James. I was stronger than the vampet, but he was larger and a seasoned fighter. He wriggled beneath me, digging his knees and elbows into the flesh of my stomach and groin, spitting into my eyes. There was a painful white light building inside my head. I felt like screaming and clapping my hands over my ears. But instead I bit into the flesh of James's upper left arm and ripped a chunk away.</p><p>James screeched like a cat and shoved me off, lent strength by his pain. As I fell aside, Darius kicked me hard in the head and I lost my bearings for a second or two. When I recovered, James was on top of me. He pushed my head back with his left hand and brought up my own knife - which I'd dropped in the fight - with his right, meaning to slitmy throat.</p><p>I grabbed for the knife. Missed. Grabbed again. Knocked it aside. Grabbed a third time - then stopped, tensed my muscles and shut my eyes. James gave a little shiver of delight. He thought I'd given up. What he didn't realize was that I'd caught sight of Harkat behind him, swinging his axe.</p><p>There was a whishing sound - Darius started to shout a warning - then a heavy thud. My eyes opened. I caught a glimpse of Morgan James's head rolling away into darkness, severed from its body by one powerful blow of Harkat's axe. Then blood gushed from the stump of James's neck. I shut my eyes again as I was drenched in a burst of hot red liquid. James fell over lifelessly. I pushed myself up, opened my eyes, wiped blood from my face, and slid out from beneath the beheaded body of Morgan James.</p><p>Darius was standing next to me, staring numbly at his felled companion. Blood had hit the boy also, drenching his trousers. I stood. My legs were trembling. My head was filled with white noise. Blood congealed in my hair and dripped from my face. I wanted to be sick. But I knew what I must do. Hatred motivated me.</p><p>Snatching my knife back from Morgan James's lifeless hand, I pressed the blade to the flesh of Darius's throat and grabbed his hair with my free hand. I was snarling as I pressed down hard on the knife, neither human nor vampire. I'd become a savage animal set on taking a young boy's life.</p><p>Chapter NINETEEN</p><p>Debbie stopped me. \"No!\" she screamed, racing up behind me. There was such terror in her voice, that even in the midst of my bloodlust, I paused. She pulled up beside me, panting hard, eyes wide with horror. \"No!\" she wheezed, shaking her head desperately.</p><p>\"Why not?\" I snarled.</p><p>\"He's a child!\" she cried.</p><p>\"No - he's Steve Leopard's son,\" I contradicted her. \"A killer, like his father.\"</p><p>\"He hasn't killed anyone,\" Debbie objected. \"Morgan James killed Mr Tall. Now he's dead, you're even. You don't have to kill the boy too.\"</p><p>\"I'll kill them all!\" I screamed madly. It was like I'd become a different person, a bloodthirsty reaper. \"Every vampaneze must die! Every vampet! Everyone who aids them!\"</p><p>\"Even the children?\" Debbie asked sickly.</p><p>\"Yes!\" I roared. My headache was the worst it had ever been. It was like red-hot pins were being pushed through my skull from the inside out. Part of me knew this was wrong, but a larger part had seized on the hatred and urge to kill. That merciless part was screaming for revenge.</p><p>\"Harkat,\" Debbie appealed to the Little Person. \"Make him see sense!\"</p><p>Harkat shook his neckless head. \"I don't think I can stop him,\" he said, staring at me as if he didn't know me.</p><p>\"You have to try!\" Debbie shrieked.</p><p>\"I don't know if I? have the right,\" Harkat muttered.</p><p>Debbie turned to me again. She was crying. \"You mustn't do this,\" she wept.</p><p>\"It's my duty,\" I said stiffly.</p><p>She spat at my feet. \"That's what I think of yourduty ! You'll become a monster if you kill that boy. You'll be no better than Steve.\"</p><p>I stopped. Her words had sparked a memory deep within me. I found myself thinking about Mr Crepsley and his last words to me before he died. He warned me not to devote my life to hatred. Kill Steve Leopard if the chance presented itself - but don't give myself over to some insane revenge quest.</p><p>What would he have done in my place? Kill the boy? Yes, if necessary. Butwas it? Did I want to kill Darius because I feared him and felt he had to be eliminated for the good of us all - or because I wanted to hurt Steve?</p><p>I gazed into the boy's eyes. They were fearful, but behind the fear there was? sorrow. In Steve's eyes, evil lurked deep down. Not in Darius. He was more human than his father.</p><p>My knife was still pressed to his throat. It had sliced thinly into his flesh. Little rivulets of blood trickled down his neck.</p><p>\"You'll destroy yourself,\" Debbie whispered hoarsely. \"You'll be worse than Steve.He can't tell the difference between right and wrong.You can. He can live with his wickedness because he doesn't know any better, but it will eat you away. Don't do it, Darren. We don't wage war on children.\"</p><p>I stared at her, tears in my eyes. I knew she was right. I wanted to take the knife away. I couldn't believe I'd even tried to kill the boy. But still there was part of me that wanted to take his life. Something had awoken within me, a Darren Shan I'd never known existed, and he wasn't going to lie down without a fight. My fingers shook as they held the knife, but the furious angel of revenge inside me wouldn't let me lower them.</p>","<p>\"Go ahead and kill me,\" Darius snarled suddenly. \"It's what your kind does. You're murderers. I know all about you, so stop pretending you give a damn.\"</p><p>\"What are you talking about?\" I said. He only smiled sickly in reply.</p><p>\"He's Steve's son,\" Debbie said softly. \"He's been raised on lies. That's not his fault.\"</p><p>\"My father doesn't lie!\" Darius shouted.</p><p>Debbie moved around behind Darius so she could look me straight in the eye. \"He doesn't know the truth. He's innocent, in spite of anything he's been tricked into doing. Don't kill an innocent, Darren. Don't become that which you despise.\"</p><p>I groaned deeply. More than ever I wanted to take the knife away, but still I wavered, fighting an inner battle which I didn't completely understand. \"I don't know what to do!\" I moaned.</p><p>\"Then think of this,\" Harkat said. \"We might need the boy to swap? for Shancus. It makes sense not to kill him.\"</p><p>The fire within me died away. I lowered the knife, feeling a great weight lift from my heart. I smiled crookedly. \"Thanks, Harkat.\"</p><p>\"You shouldn't have needed that,\" Debbie said as I spun Darius around and tied his hands behind him with a strip of cloth which Harkat had ripped from his robes. \"You should have spared him because it was the right thing to do - not because you might need him.\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\" I agreed, ashamed of my reaction but not wanting to admit it. \"But it doesn't matter. We can debate it later. First, let's find out what's happening with Shancus. Where's your phone?\"</p><p>A minute later she was deep in conversation with Alice Burgess. They were still in pursuit of R.V. and Shancus. Vancha asked to speak to me. \"We've a choice to make,\" he said. \"I have R.V. in my sights. I can cut him down with a shuriken and rescue Shancus.\"</p><p>\"Then why don't you?\" I frowned.</p><p>\"I think he's leading us to Steve Leonard,\" Vancha said.</p><p>I groaned softly and gripped the phone tightly. \"What does Evra say?\" I asked.</p><p>\"This is our call, not his,\" Vancha responded with a whisper. \"He's thinking only of his son. We have other concerns to consider.\"</p><p>\"I'm not prepared to sacrifice Shancus to get to Steve,\" I said.</p><p>\"I am,\" Vancha said quietly. \"But I doubt it will come to that. I think we can retrieve the boyand get a shot at Leonard. But it's a risk. If you want me to play it safe and kill R.V. now, I will. But I believe we should chance it, let him lead us to Leonard, and take it from there.\"</p><p>\"You're the senior Prince,\" I said. \"You decide.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Vancha retorted. \"We're equals. Shancus means more to you than he does to me. I'll follow your lead in this one.\"</p><p>\"Thanks,\" I said bitterly.</p><p>\"Sorry,\" Vancha said, and even over the phone I could tell his regret was genuine. \"I'd take responsibility if I could, but on this occasion I can't. Do I kill R.V. or follow?\"</p><p>My eyes flicked to Darius. If I'd killed him, I'd have told Vancha to bring R.V. down and save Shancus - otherwise Steve would surely slaughter the snake-boy in revenge. But if I turned up with Darius captive, Steve would have to trade. Once we had Shancus back, we'd be free to pursue Steve later.</p><p>\"OK,\" I said. \"Let him run. Tell me where you are and we'll catch up.\"</p><p>A few minutes later we were on the move again, cutting across town, Debbie on the phone to Alice, taking directions. I could feel her eyes burning into my back - she didn't approve of the risk we were taking - but I didn't look around. As I ran, I kept reminding myself, \"I'm a Prince. I have a duty to my people. The Lord of the Vampaneze takes priority over all.\" But it was a slim comfort, and I knew my sense of guilt and shame would be overwhelming if the gamble backfired.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY</p><p>We were hurrying through the streets with Darius, taking back alleys to avoid the police patrols, when Harkat slowed, came to a stop and turned. He cocked his head sideways, raising one of the ears stitched beneath his grey skin.</p><p>\"What is it?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Footsteps? behind us. Can't you hear?\"</p><p>\"My ears are plugged up,\" I reminded him. \"Are you certain?\"</p><p>\"Yes. I think it's just one person, but I? could be wrong.\"</p><p>\"We can't fight and hold on to Darius at the same time,\" Debbie said. \"If we're to make a stand, we should either tie him up or let him go.\"</p><p>\"I'm not letting him go anywhere,\" I muttered. \"You two proceed. If R.V. leads the others to Steve, you need to be there with Darius, to trade for Shancus. I'll stay and deal with this. If I can, I'll catch you up.\"</p><p>\"Don't be stupid,\" Debbie hissed. \"We've got to stick together.\"</p><p>\"Do what I say!\" I snapped, harsher than necessary. I was very confused - hatred for Steve, fear that I might become the monstrous Lord of the Shadows, the pain of the purge - and in no mood to argue.</p><p>\"Come on,\" Harkat said to Debbie. \"We can't talk to him when he's? like this. Besides, he's right. It makes more sense this way.\"</p><p>\"But the danger?\" Debbie began.</p><p>\"He's a Vampire Prince,\" Harkat said. \"He knows all about danger.\"</p><p>Harkat jerked Darius ahead, limping forward as quickly as he could. Debbie had no choice but to follow, though she looked back imploringly at me before turning a corner out of sight. I felt sorry for the way I'd snapped at her, and hoped I'd have a chance to apologize later.</p><p>I removed the cotton buds from my ears and nose and took a firm grip on my knife. By concentrating hard, I could dim the noise within my head and focus on the street sounds and scents. I heard footsteps approaching, soft, steady, coming straight towards me. I crouched low and readied myself for battle. Then a figure came into sight and I relaxed, stood and lowered my knife arm.</p><p>\"Evanna,\" I greeted the witch.</p><p>\"Darren,\" she replied calmly, stopping close by, studying me with an unreadable expression.</p><p>\"Why aren't you with your father?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I will join him again presently,\" she said. \"My place is here now, with you and your allies. Let us hurry after them, for fear we miss the confrontation.\"</p><p>\"I'm going nowhere,\" I said, standing my ground. \"Not until you give with some answers.\"</p>","<p>\"Indeed?\" Evanna purred archly. \"I will need to hear some questions first.\"</p><p>\"It's about the Lord of the Shadows.\"</p><p>\"I don't think this is the time?\"</p><p>\"I don't care what you think!\" I interrupted. \"You told me years ago that would be either the Vampaneze Lord - Steve - orme . Mr Tall, before he died, said that would rise no matter who won the War of the Scars.\"</p><p>\"Did he?\" Evanna sounded surprised. \"It was not like Hibernius to be so revealing. He was always the more secretive one.\"</p><p>\"I want to know what it means,\" I pressed on, before she got sidetracked talking about her dead brother. \"According to Mr Tall, will be a monster, and he'll kill Vancha.\"</p><p>\"He told you that too?\" Evanna was angry now. \"He went too far. He should not have?\"</p><p>\"But he did,\" I stopped her, then took a step nearer. \"He was wrong. He must have been. You too. I'm no monster. I would never harm Vancha, or any vampire.\"</p><p>\"Don't be too sure of that,\" she said softly, then hesitated, choosing her next words carefully. \"Usually, there are many paths between the present and future, dozens of options and outcomes. But sometimes there are only afew , or even just two. That is the case here, A Lord of the Shadows will come - this is definite. But he can be one of two people, you or Steve Leonard.\"</p><p>\"But?\" I began.</p><p>\"Silence,\" she said commandingly. \"Since we are so close to the time of choosing, I can reveal certain facts which before I could not. I wouldn't have spoken of this, but it seems my brother wished to inform you of your fate, perhaps to give you time to prepare for it. It is only right that I honour his final wishes.</p><p>\"If you kill Steve Leonard, youwill become a monster, the most despised and twisted the world has ever seen.\" My eyes bulged and I opened my mouth to protest, but she continued before I uttered a syllable. \"Monsters are not born fully developed. They grow, they mature, theybecome .</p><p>\"You are filling with hatred, Darren, hatred which will consume you. If you kill Steve, it will not be enough. You'll push on, driven by rages you cannot control. Because destiny has marked you out as a bearer of great power, you will create great havoc. You will destroy the vampaneze but that won't be enough. There will always be a new enemy to fight. During your quest, certain vampires will try to stop you. They too will die at your hands. Vancha will be one of them.\"</p><p>\"No,\" I moaned. \"I would never?\"</p><p>\"Not only vampires will obstruct you,\" Evanna went on, ignoring my protests. \"Humans will interfere, leading you to turn against them. And, as the vampaneze and vampires fall at your hands, so will humanity. You will reduce this world to rubble and ash. And over the remains you will rule, all-powerful, all-controlling, all-hating, for the rest of your unnaturally long and evil life.\"</p><p>She stopped and smiled at me witheringly. \"That is your future, where you taste success. In the other, you die at the hands of the alternate Lord of the Shadows, if not during the hunt for him, then later, when the rest of the clan has fallen. In many ways, that might be for the best. Now, have you any more questions?\"</p><p>\"I couldn't,\" I said numbly. \"I wouldn't. There must be some way to avoid it.\"</p><p>\"There is,\" Evanna said. She turned and pointed back the way she'd come. \"Go. Walk away. Leave your friends. Hide. If you go now, you'll break the terms of your destiny. Steve will lead the vampaneze to victory over the vampires and become the Lord of the Shadows. You can lead a normal, peaceful life - until he brings the world crashing down around you, of course.\"</p><p>\"But? I can't do that,\" I said. \"I can't turn my back on those who've put their trust in me. What about Vancha, Debbie, Shancus? I have to help them.\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Evanna said sadly. \"I know. That is why you cannot escape. You have the power to run from your destiny, but your feelings for your friends won't allow you. You'll never retreat from a challenge. You can't. And so, even though you have the best will in the world, you'll see your destiny through to its bitter end - either death by Steve's hand, or a rise to infamy as the Lord of the Shadows.\"</p><p>\"You're wrong,\" I said shakily. \"I won't do that. I'm not evil. Now that I know, I won't let myself go down that road. If I kill Steve? if we win? I'll turn my back on my destiny then. I'll save the clan if I can, then slip away. I'll go where I can't do any harm.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Evanna said simply. \"You won't. Now,\" shewent on before I could argue my case again, \"let us hurry after your friends - this night is central to the future, and it would not do to miss a moment more of it.\" With that, she slid ahead of me and followed after the others, tracking them by means of her own, leaving me to trail behind, silent, dejected, bewildered - and terrified.</p><p>We caught up with Debbie, Harkat and Darius after several minutes. They were surprised to see Evanna, but she said nothing to them, just hung back and observed us silently. As we progressed, Debbie asked me if I'd been talking with Evanna. I shook my head, unwilling to repeat what I'd been told, still trying to make sense of it and convince myself that Evanna was wrong.</p><p>We regrouped with Vancha and Evra a quarter of an hour later. They'd tracked R.V. to a building and were waiting outside for us. \"He went in a few minutes ago,\" Vancha said. \"Alice has gone around the back, in case he tries to escape that way.\" He glanced at Evanna suspiciously. \"Are you here to help or hinder, my Lady?\"</p><p>\"Neither, my Prince,\" she smiled. \"I serve merely as a witness.\"</p><p>\"Hurm!\" he grunted.</p><p>I stared up at the building. It was tall and dark, with jagged grey stones and broken windows. There were nine steps leading up to the oversized front door. The steps were cracked and covered with moss. Apart from some more moss and broken windows, it hadn't changed much since my last visit.</p><p>\"I know this place,\" I told Vancha, trying to forget about my conversation with Evanna and focus on the business at hand. \"It's an old cinema theatre. This is where the Cirque Du Freak performed when Steve and I were kids. I should have guessed this was where he'd come. It brings everything full circle. Stuff like that is important to a maniac like Steve.\"</p><p>\"You shut up about my dad!\" Darius growled.</p>","<p>\"You think Leonard's inside?\" Vancha asked, cuffing Darius around the ear.</p><p>\"I'm sure of it,\" I said, wiping streaks of Morgan James's blood from my forehead - there'd been no time to mop myself clean.</p><p>\"What about Shancus?\" Evra hissed. He was trembling with anxiety. \"Will he harm my son?\"</p><p>\"Not as long as we holdhis son captive,\" I said.</p><p>Evra stared at Darius, confused - he knew nothing about the boy - but my old friend trusted me, so he accepted my guarantee.</p><p>\"How should we play this?\" Debbie asked.</p><p>\"Just march straight in,\" I said.</p><p>\"Is that wise?\" Vancha asked. \"Perhaps we should try to sneak up on them from the back, or via the roof.\"</p><p>\"Steve's prepared this for us,\" I said. \"Anything we can think of, you can bet he's already considered. We can't outguess him. We'd be fools to try. I say we go in, face him directly, and pray that the luck of the vampires is with us.\"</p><p>\"The luck of the damned,\" Darius sneered. \"You won't beat my father or any vampaneze. We're more than a match for the likes of you.\"</p><p>Vancha studied Darius curiously. He leant up close, sniffing like a dog. Then he made a small cut on the boy's right arm - Darius didn't even wince - dabbed a finger in the blood that oozed out, and tasted it. He pulled a face. \"He's been blooded.\"</p><p>\"By my father,\" Darius said proudly.</p><p>\"He's a half-vampaneze?\" I frowned, glancing at his fingertips - they were unmarked.</p><p>\"The blood's weak within him,\" Vancha said. \"But he's one of them. There's just enough blood in his system to ensure he can never regain his humanity.\"</p><p>\"Did you volunteer for this, or did Steve force you?\" I asked Darius.</p><p>\"My father wouldn't force me to do anything!\" Darius snorted. \"Like every vampaneze, he believes in free choice - not like you lot.\"</p><p>Vancha looked at me questioningly. \"Steve's fed him a load of rubbish about us,\" I explained. \"He thinks we're evil, and his father's a noble crusader.\"</p><p>\"He is!\" Darius shouted. \"He'll stop you from taking over the world! He won't let you kill freely! He'll keep the night safe from you vampire scum!\"</p><p>Vancha cocked an amused eyebrow at me. \"If we had time, I'd take great delight in setting this boy straight. But we haven't. Debbie - phone Alice and tell her to come here. We'll go in together - all for one and all that guff.\"</p><p>While Debbie was on the phone, Vancha pulled me aside and nodded at Evra, who was standing a few metres ahead of us, gazing at the entrance to the cinema, fingers twisted into desperate fists. \"He's in a bad way,\" Vancha said.</p><p>\"Of course,\" I muttered. \"How would you expect him to react?\"</p><p>\"Are you clear on what we must do?\" Vancha responded. I stared at him coldly. He grabbed my arms and squeezed tight. \"Leonardmust be killed. You and I are expendable. So are Debbie, Alice, Harkat, Evra - and Shancus.\"</p><p>\"I want to save him,\" I said miserably.</p><p>\"So do I,\" Vancha sighed. \"And we will, if we can. But the Lord of the Vampaneze comes first. Remember what happens if we fail - the vampires will be destroyed. Would you trade the snake-boy's life for all those of our clan?\"</p><p>\"Of course not,\" I said, shaking myself free. \"But I won't abandon him cheaply. If Steve's prepared to deal, I'll deal. We can fight him some other night.\"</p><p>\"And if he won't deal?\" Vancha pressed. \"If he forces a showdown?\"</p><p>\"Then we'll fight, and we'll kill or we'll die - whatever the cost.\" I locked gazes with him so he could see I was telling the truth.</p><p>Vancha checked his shurikens and drew a few. Then we turned, gathered our allies around us - Debbie dragged Darius along - and advanced up the steps and into the old abandoned cinema theatre where, for me, all those years ago, the nightmares had begun.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-ONE</p><p>It was like stepping back into the past. The building was cooler and damper than before, and fresh graffiti had been scrawled across the walls, but otherwise it was no different. I led the way down the long corridor where Mr Tall had sneaked up on Steve and me, appearing out of the darkness with that incredible speed and silence which had been his trademark. A left turn at the end. I noted the spot where Mr Tall had taken and eaten our tickets. Back then, blue curtains had been draped across the entrance to the auditorium. There were no curtains tonight - the only change.</p><p>We entered the auditorium, two abreast, Vancha and Alice in front, Debbie and Evra next (Debbie pushing Darius in front of her), then Harkat and I. Evanna drifted along further back, detached from us by distance and attitude.</p><p>It was completely black inside the auditorium. I couldn't see anything. But I could hear deep, muffled breathing, coming from somewhere far ahead of us. \"Vancha,\" I whispered.</p><p>\"I know,\" he whispered back.</p><p>\"Should we move towards it?\" I asked.</p><p>\"No,\" he replied. \"It's too dark. Wait.\"</p><p>A minute passed. Two. Three. I could feel the tension rising, both in myself and those around me. But nobody broke rank or spoke. We stood in the darkness, waiting, leaving the first move to our foes.</p><p>Several minutes later, without warning, spotlights were switched on overhead. Everyone gasped and I cried out loud, hunching over, covering my extra-sensitive eyes with my hands. We were defenceless for a few vital seconds. That would have been the ideal time for an attack. I expected vampaneze and vampets to fall upon us, weapons flashing - but nothing happened.</p><p>\"Are your eyes OK?\" Debbie asked, crouching beside me.</p><p>\"Not really,\" I groaned, slowly raising my eyelids a fraction, just enough to see out of. Even that was agony.</p><p>Holding a hand over my eyes, I squinted ahead and caught my breath. It was a good job we hadn't advanced. The entire floor of the auditorium had been torn out. In its place, spreading from one wall to the other, running from a few metres ahead of us all the way to the foot of the stage, was a giant pit, filled with sharpened stakes.</p><p>\"Impressive, isn't it?\" someone called from the stage. My eyes lifted. It was hard to see, because the lights were being trained on us from above the stage, but I gradually brought the scene into focus. Dozens of tall, thick logs clotted the stage, placed vertically, ideal cover. Sticking out from behind one log near the front was the grinning face of Steve Leopard.</p>","<p>When Vancha saw Steve, he drew a shuriken and threw it at him. But Steve had picked his spot carefully and the throwing star ended up buried in the wood of the log behind which he was standing.</p><p>\"Bad luck, Sire,\" Steve laughed. \"Care to make it the best throw out of three?\"</p><p>\"Maybe I can get him,\" Alice muttered, stepping up past Vancha. She raised her pistol and fired, but the bullet penetrated no deeper than the shuriken.</p><p>\"Is that the preliminaries out of the way, or do you want to take a few more pot shots?\" Steve called.</p><p>\"I could possibly leap the pit,\" Vancha said dubiously, studying the rows of stakes between him and the stage.</p><p>\"Don't be ridiculous,\" I grunted. Even vampires had their limits.</p><p>\"I don't see anybody else,\" Debbie whispered, casting her eyes around the auditorium. The balcony above us - from where I'd spied on Steve and Mr Crepsley - could have been swarming with vampaneze and vampets, but I didn't think so - I could hear nothing overhead, not even a single heartbeat.</p><p>\"Where's your army?\" Vancha shouted at Steve.</p><p>\"Around and about,\" Steve replied sweetly.</p><p>\"Didn't you bring them with you?\" Vancha challenged him.</p><p>\"Not tonight,\" Steve said. \"I don't need them. The only people sharing the stage with me are my fairy godfather - a.k.a. Gannen Harst - a certain Righteous Vampaneze, and a very scared young snake-boy. What's his name again, R.V.?\"</p><p>\"Shancus,\" came the reply from behind a log to Steve's left.</p><p>\"Shancus!\" Evra roared. \"Are you all right?\"</p><p>There was no reply. My heart sank. Then R.V. pushed Shancus out from behind the log, and we saw that although his hands were tied behind his back, and he was gagged, he was still very much alive, and he looked unharmed.</p><p>\"He's a spirited lad,\" Steve laughed. \"A bit loud though, hence the gag. Some of the language he uses? Shocking! I don't know where kids today pick up such filthy words.\" Steve paused. \"By the way, how's my own beloved flesh and blood doing? I can't see too well from here.\"</p><p>\"I'm fine, Dad!\" Darius shouted. \"But they killed Morgan! The grey one cut off his head with an axe!\"</p><p>\"How grisly.\" Steve didn't sound the least bit upset. \"I told you they were savages, son. No respect for life.\"</p><p>\"It was revenge!\" Harkat yelled. \"He killed Mr Tall.\"</p><p>There was silence on the stage. Steve seemed lost for words. Then, from a log close by Steve, I heard Gannen Harst call out to R.V., \"Is this true?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" R.V. mumbled. \"He shot him.\"</p><p>\"How do you know he killed him?\" Steve asked. \"Tall might have simply been wounded.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Evanna answered, her first word of the encounter. \"He is dead. Morgan James murdered him.\"</p><p>\"Is that you, Lady Evanna?\" Steve asked uncertainly.</p><p>\"Yes,\" she said.</p><p>\"Not up to any mischief, I hope, like siding with the vampires?\" He said it flippantly, but his anxiety was evident - he didn't fancy a clash with the Lady of the Wilds.</p><p>\"I have never taken sides between the vampires and vampaneze, and have no intention of starting now,\" Evanna said coolly.</p><p>\"That's OK then,\" Steve chuckled, confidence returning. \"Interesting about Mr Tall. I always thought he couldn't be killed by ordinary weapons. I'd have gone after him a long time ago if I'd known he could be so easily bumped off.\"</p><p>\"Gone after him for what?\" I shouted.</p><p>\"Harbouring criminals,\" Steve giggled.</p><p>\"You're the only criminal here,\" I retorted.</p><p>Steve sighed theatrically. \"See how they slander me, son? They soil this world with their murderous presence, then point the finger of blame elsewhere. That's always been the vampire way.\"</p><p>I started to respond, then decided I'd be wasting my time. \"Let's cut the crap,\" I called instead. \"You didn't lead us here for a war of words. Are you coming out from behind that log or not?\"</p><p>\"Not!\" Steve cackled. \"Do you think I'm insane? You'd cut me down dead!\"</p><p>\"Then why did you bring us here?\" I looked around again, nervous. I couldn't believe he hadn't laid a trap, that there weren't dozens of vampaneze or vampets slithering up on us as we talked. Yet I didn't sense a threat. I could see Vancha was confused too.</p><p>\"I want to chat, Darren,\" Steve said. \"I'd like to discuss a peace treaty.\"</p><p>I had to laugh at that - it was such a ludicrous notion. \"Maybe you want to become my blood-brother,\" I jeered.</p><p>\"In a way, I already am,\" Steve said cryptically. Then his eyes narrowed slyly. \"You missed Tommy's funeral while you were recovering.\"</p><p>I cursed fiercely but quietly. \"Why kill Tommy?\" I snarled. \"Why drag him into your warped web of revenge? Didhe 'betray' you too?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Steve said. \"Tommy was my friend. Even while others were bad-mouthing me, he stuck by me. I had nothing against him. A great goalkeeper too.\"</p><p>\"Then why have him killed?\" I screamed.</p><p>\"What are you talking about?\" Darius cut in. \"You killed Tom Jones. Morgan and R.V. tried to stop you, but? That's right, isn't it, Dad?\" he asked, and I saw the first flickers of doubt stir in the boy's eyes.</p><p>\"I told you, son,\" Steve replied, \"you can't believe anything a vampire says. Pay no attention to him.\" Then, to me, he said, \"Didn't you wonder how Tommy got his ticket to the Cirque Du Freak?\"</p><p>\"I just assumed?\" I stopped. \"You set him up!\"</p><p>\"Of course,\" Steve chuckled. \"Withyour help. Remember the ticket you gave to Darius? He passed it on. Tommy was opening a sports store, signing autographs. Darius went along and 'swapped' his ticket for a signed football. We still have it lying around somewhere. Could be a collector's item soon.\"</p><p>\"You're sick,\" I snarled. \"Using a child to do your dirty work - disgusting.\"</p><p>\"Not really,\" Steve disagreed. \"It just shows how highly I value the young.\"</p><p>Now that I knew Steve had given Tommy the ticket, my mind raced ahead, putting the pieces of his plan together. \"You couldn't have known for sure that Tommy would run into me at the show,\" I said.</p>","<p>\"No, but I guessed he would. If he hadn't, I'd have worked out some other way to manoeuvre you together. I didn't need to, but I liked the idea. Him being here at the same time as us was providence. I'm just slightly miffed that Alan wasn't here too - that would have made for a complete reunion.\"</p><p>\"What about my cup ticket? How did you find out about that?\"</p><p>\"I phoned Tommy that morning,\" Steve said. \"He was astonished - first he bumps into his old pal Darren, then he hears from his old buddy Steve. What a coincidence! I faked astonishment too. I asked all about you. Learnt that you were coming to the match. He invited me as well, but I said I couldn't make it.\"</p><p>\"Very clever,\" I complimented him icily.</p><p>\"Not especially,\" Steve said with false modesty. \"I simply used his innocence to ensnare you. Manipulating the innocent is child's play. I'm surprised you didn't see through it. You need to work on your paranoia, Darren. Suspect everyone, even those beyond suspicion - that's my motto.\"</p><p>Vancha edged up close to me. \"If you keep him talking, maybe I can slip out back and attack him from the rear,\" he whispered.</p><p>I nodded my head a fraction and Vancha slid away slowly. \"Tommy told me he'd been in contact with you in the past,\" I said loudly, hoping to mask the sound of Vancha's footsteps. \"He said there was something about you that he had to tell me the next time we met, after the match.\"</p><p>\"I can guess what that was,\" Steve purred.</p><p>\"Care to share it with me?\"</p><p>\"Not yet,\" he said. Then, sharply, \"If you take one more step towards that door, Mr March, the snake-boy dies.\" Vancha stopped and shot Steve a look of disgust.</p><p>\"Leave my son alone!\" Evra screamed. He'd been holding himself in check, but Steve's threat proved too much. \"If you harm him, I'll kill you! I'll put you through so much agony, you'll pray for death!\"</p><p>\"My!\" Steve cooed. \"Such vindictiveness! You seem to have the knack of driving all your friends to violence, Darren. Or do you deliberately surround yourself with violent people?\"</p><p>\"Stuff it!\" I grunted. Then, tiring of his verbal games, I said, \"Are you going to fight or not?\"</p><p>\"Ialready answered that question,\" Steve said. \"We'll fight soon, have no fear, but this is neither the time nor place. There's a rear tunnel - newly carved - which we'll leave by shortly. By the time you pick your way through the stakes, we'll be far out of reach.\"</p><p>\"Then what are you waiting for?\" I snarled. \"Get the hell out!\"</p><p>\"Not yet,\" Steve said, and hisvoice was hard now. \"There's the sacrifice to make first. In the old days, a sacrifice was always made before a large battle, to appease the gods. Now, it's true that the vampaneze don't have any official gods, but to be on the safe side?\"</p><p>\"No!\" Evra screamed - it was as clear to him as to the rest of us what Steve meant to do.</p><p>\"Don't!\" I shouted.</p><p>\"Gannen!\" Vancha roared. \"You can't allow this!\"</p><p>\"I have no say in it, brother,\" Gannen Harst responded from behind his log. He hadn't shown his face yet. I had the feeling he was ashamed to show it.</p><p>\"Ready, R.V.?\" Steve asked.</p><p>\"I'm not sure about this, man,\" R.V. replied uneasily.</p><p>\"Don't disobey me!\" Steve growled. \"I made you and I can break you. Now, you bearded, armless freak - are you ready?\"</p><p>A short pause. Then R.V. answered softly, \"Yes.\"</p><p>Vancha cursed and raced forward to force his way through the pit of stakes. Harkat lumbered after him. Alice and Debbie fired on the log protecting Steve, but their bullets couldn't pierce it. I stood, clutching my knife, thinking desperately.</p><p>Then a voice behind me called out shakily, \"Dad?\" Everybody paused. I looked back. Darius was trembling. \"Dad?\" he called again. \"You're not really going to kill him, are you?\"</p><p>\"Be quiet!\" Steve snapped. \"You don't understand what's happening.\"</p><p>\"But? he's just a kid? like me. You can't?\"</p><p>\"Shut up!\" Steve roared. \"I'll explain later! Just?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I interrupted, sliding up behind Darius. \"There won't be any 'later'. If you kill Shancus, I'll kill Darius.\" For the second time that night I felt a dark spirit grow within me, and pressed the blade of my knife to the young boy's throat. Behind me, Evanna made a small cooing noise. I ignored her.</p><p>\"You're bluffing,\" Steve jeered. \"You couldn't kill a child.\"</p><p>\"He could,\" Debbie answered for me. She stepped away. \"Darren was going to kill him earlier. Harkat stopped him. He said we'd need the boy to trade for Shancus. Otherwise Darren would have killed him. Darius - is that the truth?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Darius moaned. He was weeping. Part of it was fear, but an equal part was horror. His father had raised him on lies and false heroics. Only now was he beginning to realize what sort of monster he'd aligned himself with.</p><p>I heard Steve mutter something. He peered out from around his log, studying us from the heights of the stage. I made no threatening moves. I didn't need to. My determination was clear.</p><p>\"Very well,\" Steve snorted. \"Throw away your weapons and we'll swap the two boys.\"</p><p>\"You think we'll entrust ourselves to your untender mercies?\" Vancha huffed. \"Release Shancus and we'll turn your son over.\"</p><p>\"Not until you shed your weapons,\" Steve insisted.</p><p>\"And allow you to mow us down?\" Vancha challenged him.</p><p>There was a short pause. Then Steve threw an arrow-gun away, far across the stage. \"Gannen,\" he said, \"am I carrying any other weapons?\"</p><p>\"A sword and two knives,\" Gannen Harst replied immediately.</p><p>\"I don't mean those,\" Steve growled. \"Do I have any long-range weapons?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Gannen said.</p><p>\"What about you and R.V.?\"</p><p>\"We have none either.\"</p><p>\"I know you don't believe a word I say,\" Steve shouted to Vancha, \"but you trust your own brother, don't you? He's a pure vampaneze - he'd kill himself before he'd utter a lie.\"</p><p>\"Aye,\" Vancha muttered unhappily.</p><p>\"Then throw away your weapons,\" Steve said. \"We won't attack if you don't.\"</p>","<p>Vancha looked to me for advice. \"Do it,\" I said. \"He's tied, just like we are. He won't risk his son's life.\"</p><p>Vancha was dubious, but he slipped off his belts of throwing stars and tossed them aside. Debbie threw her pistols away and so, reluctantly, did Alice. Harkat only had an axe, which he laid down on the floor beside him. I kept my knife to Darius's throat.</p><p>Steve stepped out from behind the log. He was grinning. I felt a great temptation to throw my knife at him - I might just have been able to strike him from this distance - but I didn't. As a Vampire Prince, and one of the hunters of the Vampaneze Lord, I should have. But I couldn't risk missing and enraging Steve. He'd kill Shancus if I did.</p><p>\"Out you come, boys,\" Steve said. Gannen Harst and R.V. emerged from behind their logs, R.V. shoving the bound Shancus ahead of him. Gannen Harst was typically grim-faced, but R.V. was smiling. At first I thought it was a mocking smile, but then I realized it was a smile of relief - he was delighted he hadn't been called upon to kill the snake-boy. R.V. was a twisted, bitter, crazy man, but I saw then that he wasn't entirely evil - not like Steve.</p><p>\"I'll take the reptile,\" Steve said, reaching for Shancus. \"You go get the plank and extend it across the pit.\"</p><p>R.V. handed Shancus to Steve and retreated to the rear of the stage. He started dragging a long plank forward. It was awkward for him - he couldn't get a decent grip, because of the hooks Mr Tall had torn off. Gannen went to help him, keeping one eye on us. The pair began feeding the plank across the pit, letting it rest on blunt-tipped stakes, which I could now see had been placed there specifically for this purpose.</p><p>Steve watched us like a hawk while R.V. and Gannen were busy with the plank. He was holding Shancus in front of him, stroking the snake-boy's long green hair. I didn't like the way he was looking at us - I felt as though we were being X-rayed - but I said nothing, willing R.V. and Gannen to hurry up with the plank.</p><p>Steve's eyes lingered on Evra a long moment - he was smiling hopefully, hands half-reaching out to his son - then settled on me. He stopped stroking Shancus's hair and gently placed a hand on either side of his head. \"Remember the games we played when we were children?\" he asked craftily.</p><p>\"What games?\" I frowned. I had a terrible feeling - a sense of total doom - but I could do nothing but follow his lead.</p><p>\"'Dare' games,\" Steve said, and something in his voice made R.V. and Gannen pause and look around. Steve's face was expressionless, but his eyes were alive with insane glee. \"One of us would say, 'I dare you to do this,' and stick his hand in a fire or jab a pin in his leg. The other would have to copy him. Remember?\"</p><p>\"No!\" I moaned. I knew what was coming. I knew I couldn't stop it. I knew I'd been a fool and made a fool's mistake - I'd assumed Steve was even the slightest bit human.</p><p>\"I dare you to do this, Darren,\" Steve whispered dreadfully. Before I could reply - before anything else could happen - he seized Shancus's head tightly and twisted it sharply to the left, then the right. Shancus's neck snapped. Steve dropped him. Shancus fell to the floor. Steve had killed him.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-TWO</p><p>Steve's act of pure, pointlessevil caught everyone by gut-wrenching shock. For a long moment we just stared at him and the lifeless body by his feet. Even Steve looked stunned, as though he'd acted without thinking it through.</p><p>Then Evra went wild. \"Bastard!\" he screamed, hurling himself at the pit of stakes. If Harkat hadn't reacted and knocked him aside, Evra would have impaled himself on the stakes and died like his son.</p><p>\"I can't believe?\" Alice muttered, face whiter than usual. Then her features hardened and she ran for the pistol she'd discarded.</p><p>Debbie sank to her knees, weeping, unable to deal with such wickedness. As hardened as she'd become, nothing in her life had prepared her for this.</p><p>Harkat was struggling with Evra, pinning him down, protecting him from his rage. Evra was screaming hysterically and pounding Harkat's broad grey face with his scaly fists, but Harkat held firm.</p><p>Vancha was at the pit of stakes, lurching through them, clambering over the sharpened tips, driving towards the stage like a man possessed.</p><p>R.V. and Gannen Harst were staring at Steve, jaws slack.</p><p>Evanna was looking on silently. If the murder had shocked her, she was masking it incredibly well.</p><p>Darius was stiff with terror, holding his breath, eyes wide.</p><p>I was still behind Darius, my knife at his throat. I was the calmest of everyone there (except Evanna). Not because I was in any way unaffected by what had happened, but because I knew what I must do in retaliation. The fierce, hard, hating part within me had flared to life and taken over completely. I saw the world through differenteyes . It was a dreadful, wicked place, where only the dreadful and wicked could prosper. To defeat an evil monster like Steve, I had to sink to his depths myself. Mr Crepsley had warned me not to, but he was wrong. What did it matter if I followed Steve down the road of total evil? Stopping him - getting revenge for all the people he'd killed - was the only thing I cared about now.</p><p>While I was thinking all this through, Gannen snapped to his senses and saw that Vancha was closing on them. He hurried to his Lord, grabbed Steve by the right arm and spun him towards the exit, cursing foully. R.V. rose shakily and stumbled after them. He stopped, vomited, then reeled ahead.</p><p>Alice found her pistol, brought it up and fired. But there were too many logs between her and the vampaneze. She didn't even get close to them.</p><p>Steve stopped by the tunnel entrance at the rear of the stage. Gannen tried to push him downit , but he shook his protector's hands away and turned to glare triumphantly - daringly - at me.</p><p>\"Go on!\" Steve screamed. \"Show me you can do it! I dare you! I double dare you!\"</p><p>In that moment, as if our minds were somehow joined, I understood Steve entirely. Part of him was appalled by his brutality. He was hanging dangerously on the edge of outright madness. As the monster within me had grown this night, so had the human within Steve. He needed me to match his evil deeds. If I killed Darius, Steve could justify his cruelty and continue. But if I didn't respond to his evil with an equally evil act of my own, it would drive home the truth about how far he'd fallen. He might even snap beneath the weight of full realization and go mad. I had the power to destroy him - with mercy.</p><p>But I couldn't find mercy within myself. The fires of fury in my heart and head demanded I kill Darius. Right or wrong, I had to avenge Shancus's death. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life. Out of the corner of one eye I caught sight of Evanna. Her gaze was locked on me. There was no pity in her expression, merely the weariness of one who has seen all the evils of the world and must watch them repeat themselves over and over again.</p>","<p>\"Dare accepted,\" I said, abandoning myself to my dark destiny, knowing in that moment that I was betraying all my moral beliefs. This was the start of the path to damnation. If I defeated Steve, Iwould become the Lord of the Shadows, and in the long, blood-red decades and centuries ahead, I'd be able to point back to this night and say, \"That was where the monster was born.\"</p><p>I began to draw my knife across Darius's throat. This time Debbie didn't try to stop me - she sensed my damnation, and was powerless to save me. But then I paused. The throat was too impersonal a target. I wanted Steve to reallyfeel this.</p><p>Lowering the knife, I cut away Darius's shirt, revealing his bare, pale chest. I positioned the tip of the knife over his heart and gazed at Steve, no longer blinking against the searing lights, my eyes dark, my lips tight over my teeth.</p><p>Steve's expression steadied. The beast within him had seen its mirror image in me, and was satisfied. He drew back from the madness, becoming his cold, crafty, calculating self again. He smiled.</p><p>I drew my arm back to its full extent, so I could strike swiftly with the knife. I meant to stab Darius with all my strength and kill him quickly. I might be a monster, but I wasn't an entirely heartless one. At least, not yet.</p><p>But Steve called out before I pierced his son's heart. \"Be careful, Darren! You don't know who you're killing.'\"</p><p>I shouldn't have hesitated. I knew, if I did; that he'd derail me with some other twisted trick. Listening to demons was dangerous. Better to act in haste and shut your ears to them.</p><p>But I couldn't help myself. There was something darkly inviting about his tone. It was like when someone was about to tell a gruesome but hilarious joke. I could feel the awfulness of it, but also the humour. I had to hear him out.</p><p>\"Darius,\" Steve chuckled, \"tell Darren your mother's name.\" Darius gawped at his father, unable to respond. \"Darius!\" Steve roared. \"He's about to drive a knife through your heart! Tell him your mother's name - now!\"</p><p>\"Ah-ah-ah-Annie,\" Darius wheezed, and I froze.</p><p>\"And her surname?\" Steve asked softly, relishing the moment.</p><p>\"Shan,\" Darius whispered uncomprehendingly. \"Annie Shan. What about it?\"</p><p>\"You see, Darren,\" Steve purred, winking at me before vanishing down the tunnel to freedom, \"if you kill Darius, you won't just be slaughtering my son - you'll be murderingyour nephew !\"</p>"]},{"title":"Sons of Destiny","pages":["<p>PROLOGUE</p><p>If my life was a fairy tale and I was writing a book about it, I'd start with, \"Once upon a time there were two boys called Darren and Steve...\" But my life's a horror story, so if I were to write about it, I'd have to begin with something like this instead:</p><p>Evil has a name - Steve Leopard.</p><p>He was born Steve Leonard, but to his friends (yes - he had friends once!) he was always Steve Leopard. He was never happy at home, didn't have a dad, didn't like his mum. He dreamt of power and glory. He yearned for strength and respect, and time in which to enjoy it. He wanted to be a vampire.</p><p>His chance came when he spotted a creature of the night, Larten Crepsley, performing in the wondrous magical show, the Cirque Du Freak. He asked Mr Crepsley to blood him. The vampire refused - he said Steve had bad blood. Steve hated him for that and vowed to track him down and kill him when he grew up.</p><p>Some years later, as Steve was preparing for his life as a vampire hunter, he learnt about the purple-skinned, red-eyed vampaneze. In legends, vampires are wicked killers who suck humans dry.</p><p>Steve went in search of the vampaneze, certain they'd accept him. He probably thought they were as twisted as he was. But he got it wrong. Although the vampaneze were killers, they weren't inherently evil. They didn't torture humans and they tried not to interfere with vampires. They went about their business quietly and calmly, keeping a lower-than-low profile.</p><p>I don't know this for sure, but I'm guessing the vampaneze rejected Steve, just like Mr Crepsley did. The vampaneze live by even stricter, more traditional rules than vampires. I can't see them accepting a human into their ranks if they knew he was going to turn out bad.</p><p>But Steve found a way in, thanks to that eternal agent of chaos - Desmond Tiny. Most just call him Mr Tiny, but if you shorten his first name and put it with his surname, you get MrDestiny . He's the most powerful person in the world, immortal as far as anyone knows, a meddler of the highest order. He gave the vampaneze a present many centuries earlier, a coffin which filled with fire whenever a person lay within it, burning them to ash within seconds. But he said that one night someone would lie in the coffin and emerge unharmed. That person would be the Lord of the Vampaneze and had to be obeyed by every member of the clan. If they accepted this Lord, they'd gain more power than they'd ever imagined. Otherwise they'd be destroyed.</p><p>The promise of such power proved too much for Steve to ignore. He decided to take the test. He probably figured he had nothing to lose. He entered the coffin, the flames engulfed him, and a minute later he stepped out unburnt. Suddenly, everything changed. He had an army of vampaneze at his command, willing to give their lives for him and do anything he asked. He no longer had to settle for killing Mr Crepsley - he could wipe out the entire vampire clan!</p><p>But Mr Tiny didn't want the vampaneze to crush the vampires too easily. He thrives on suffering and conflict. A quick, assured victory wouldn't provide him with enough entertainment. So he gave the vampires a get-out clause. Three of them had the ability to kill the Vampaneze Lord before he came fully into his powers. They'd have four chances. If they were successful and killed him, the vampires would win the War of the Scars (that's what the battle between the vampires and vampaneze was known as). If they failed, two would die during the hunt, while the third would survive to witness the downfall of the clan.</p><p>Mr Crepsley was one of the hunters. A Vampire Prince, Vancha March, was another. The last was also a Prince, the youngest ever, a half-vampire called Darren Shan - and that's whereI come in.</p><p>I was Steve's best friend when we were kids. We went to the Cirque Du Freak together, and through Steve I learnt of the existence of vampires and was sucked into their world. I was blooded by Mr Crepsley and served as his assistant. Under his guidance I studied the ways of vampires and travelled to Vampire Mountain. There I undertook my Trials of Initiation - and failed. Fearing death, I fled, but during my escape I uncovered a plot to destroy the clan. Later I exposed it, and as a reward I was not only accepted into the fold, but made a Vampire Prince.</p><p>After six years in Vampire Mountain, Mr Tinyset me on the trail of the Lord of the Vampaneze, along with Mr Crepsley and Vancha. One of Mr Tiny's Little People travelled with us. His name was Harkat Mulds. Little People are grey-skinned, stitched-together, short, with large green eyes, no nose, and ears sewn beneath the flesh of their heads. They're created from the remains of dead people. Harkat didn't know who he used to be, but we later found out he was Kurda Smahlt in his previous life - the vampire who'd betrayed the clan in the hope of preventing the War of the Scars.</p><p>Not knowing who the Vampaneze Lord was, we missed our first chance to kill him when Vancha let him escape, because he was under the protection of Vancha's vampaneze brother, Gannen Harst. Later, in the city of Mr Crepsley's youth, I ran into Steve again. He told me he was a vampaneze hunter and, fool that I was, I believed him. The others did too, although Mr Crepsley was suspicious. He sensed something wrong, but I convinced him to grant Steve the benefit of the doubt. I've made some terrible mistakes in my life, but that was certainly the worst.</p><p>When Steve revealed his true colours, we fought, and twice we had the power to kill him. The first time we let him live because we wanted to trade his life for Debbie Hemlock's - my human girlfriend. The second time, Mr Crepsley fought Steve, Gannen Harst and an impostor, who was pretending to be the Lord of the Vampaneze. Mr Crepsley killed the impostor, but then was knocked into a pit of stakes by Steve. He could have taken Steve down with him, but let him live so that Gannen and the other vampaneze would spare the lives of his friends. It was only afterwards that Steve revealed the truth about himself, and made the bitter loss of Mr Crepsley all the more unbearable.</p><p>There was a long gap between that and our next encounter. I went with Harkat to find out the truth about his past, to a waste world full of monsters and mutants, which we later discovered was Earth in the future. Upon my return I spent a couple of years travelling with the Cirque Du Freak, waiting for destiny (or Des Tiny) to pit Steve and me together again for one final clash.</p><p>Our paths finally crossed in our old home town. I'd returned with the Cirque Du Freak. It was strange revisiting the past, walking the streets of the town where I'd grown up. I saw my sister Annie, now a grown woman with a child of her own, and I ran into an old friend, Tommy Jones, who'd become a professional footballer. I went to watch Tommy play in an important cup game. His team won, but their celebrations were cut short when two of Steve's henchmen invaded the pitch and killed a lot of people, including Tommy.</p>","<p>I chased after the murderous pair, straight into a trap. I faced Steve again. He had a child called Darius with him - his son. Darius shot me. Steve could have finished me off, but didn't. It wasn't the destined time. My end (or his) would only come when I faced him with Vancha by my side.</p><p>Crawling through the streets, I was rescued by a pair of tramps. They'd been recruited by Debbie and an ex-police inspector, Alice Burgess, who were building a human army to help the vampires. Vancha March linked up with me while I was recovering. With the ladies and Harkat, we returned to the Cirque Du Freak. We discussed the future with Mr Tall, the owner of the circus. He told us that no matter who won the war, an evil dictator known as the Lord of the Shadows would rise to rule and destroy the world.</p><p>As we were trying to come to terms with the shocking news, two of Steve's crazed followers struck -</p><p>R.V. and Morgan James, the pair who'd killed Tommy. With the help of Darius, they slaughtered Mr Tall and took a hostage - a young boy called Shancus. Half human, half snake, he was the son of one of my best friends, Evra Von.</p><p>As Mr Tall lay dying, Mr Tiny and a witch called Evanna mysteriously appeared out of nowhere. It turned out that Mr Tiny was Mr Tall's father, and Evanna his sister. Mr Tiny stayed to mourn the death of his son, while Evanna followed us as we chased after her brother's killers. We managed to kill Morgan James and capture Darius. As the others hurried after R.V. and Shancus, I stole a few words with Evanna. The witch had the ability to see into the future and she revealed that if I killed Steve, I would take his place as the dreaded Lord of the Shadows. I'd become a monster, murder Vancha and anybody else who got in my way, and destroy not just the vampaneze, but humanity as well.</p><p>As shocked as I was, there was no time to brood. With my allies, we tracked R.V. to the old cinema where Steve and I had first met Mr Crepsley. Steve was waiting for us, safe on the stage, separated from us by a pit which he'd had dug and filled with stakes. He mocked us for a while, then agreed to trade Shancus's life for Darius's. But he lied. Instead of releasing the snake-boy, he killed him brutally. I still had hold of Darius. In a blind, cold rage, I prepared to murder him for revenge. But just before I stabbed the boy, Steve stopped me with his cruellest revelation yet - Darius's mother was my sister, Annie. If I murdered Steve's son, I'd be killing my own nephew.</p><p>And with that he departed, cackling like the demon he was, leaving me to the madness of the blood-drenched night.</p><p>PART ONE</p><p>Chapter ONE</p><p>Sitting on the stage. Gazing around the theatre. Remembering the thrilling show I saw the first time I came. Comparing it to tonight's warped 'entertainment'. Feeling very small and lonely.</p><p>Vancha didn't lose his head, even when Steve played his trump card. He kept going, picked his way through the pit of stakes to the stage, then raced down the tunnel which Steve, Gannen and R.V. had fled by. It led to the streets at the rear of the theatre. No way of telling which way they'd gone. He returned, cursing with fury. When he saw Shancus, lying dead on the stage like a bird with a broken neck, he stopped and sank to his knees.</p><p>Evra was next across, following Vancha's route through the stakes, crying out Shancus's name, screaming for him not to die, even though he must have known it was too late, that his son was already dead. We should have held him back - he fell and pierced himself several times, and could easily have perished - but we were frozen with shock and horror.</p><p>Fortunately Evra made it to the stage without injuring himself too severely. Once there, he slumped beside Shancus, desperately checked for signs of life, then howled with loss. Sobbing and moaning with grief, he cradled the dead boy's head in his lap, tears dripping on to his son's motionless face. The rest of us watched from a distance. We were all crying bitterly, even the normally steel-faced Alice Burgess.</p><p>In time, Harkat also climbed through the stakes. There was a long plank on the stage. He and Vancha extendedit over the pit, so that the rest of us could join them. I don't think anybody really wanted to goup there. For a long moment none of us moved. Then Debbie, sobbing with deep, wracking gulps,stumbled to the plank and hauled herself up.</p><p>Alice crossed the pit next. I brought up the rear. I was shaking uncontrollably. I wanted to turn and run. Earlier, I thought I knew how I'd feel if our gamble backfired and Steve killed Shancus. But I'd known nothing. I never truly expected Steve to murder the snake-boy. I'd let R.V. march the boy into Steve's den, certain no harm would come to my honorary godson.</p><p>Now that Steve had made a fool of me (yet again) and slaughtered Shancus, all I wanted was to be dead. I couldn't feel pain if I was dead. No shame. No guilt. I wouldn't have to look Evra in the eye, knowing I was responsible for his son's needless, shocking death.</p><p>We'd forgotten about Darius. I hadn't killed him - how could I kill my own nephew? Following Steve's triumphant revelation, the hatred and anger which had filled me like a fire, drained away from me in an instant. I released Darius, having lost my murderous interest in him, and just left him on the far side of the pit.</p><p>Evanna was standing near the boy, idly picking at one of the ropes which encircled her body - she preferred ropes to ordinary clothes. It was clear from the witch's stance that she wouldn't interfere if Darius made a break for freedom. It would have been the simplest thing in the world for him to escape. But he didn't. He stood, sentry-like, trembling, waiting for us to summon him.</p><p>Finally Alice stumbled over to me, wiping tears from her face. \"We should take them back to the Cirque Du Freak,\" she said, nodding at Evra and Shancus.</p><p>\"In a while,\" I agreed, dreading the moment I'd have to face Evra. And what about Merla, Shancus's mother? WouldI have to break the terrible news to her?</p><p>\"No - now,\" Alice said firmly. \"Harkat and Debbie can take them. We need to straighten some things out before we leave.\" She nodded at Darius, tiny and vulnerable under the glare of the lights.</p><p>\"I don't want to talk about this,\" I groaned.</p><p>\"I know,\" she said. \"But we must. The boy might know where Steve is staying. If he does, this is the time to strike. They won't expect-\"</p><p>\"How can you even think about such things?\" I hissed angrily. \"Shancus is dead! Don't you care?\"</p><p>She slapped my face. I blinked, stunned. \"You're not a child, Darren, so don't act like one,\" she said coldly. \"Of course I care. But we can't bring him back, and we'll achieve nothing by standing around, moping. We need to act. Only in swift revenge can we maybe find a small sliver of comfort.\"</p>","<p>She was right. Self-pity was a waste. Revenge was essential. As hard as it was, I dug myself out of my misery and set about sending Shancus's body home. Harkat didn't want to leave with Evra and Debbie. He wanted to stay and chase Steve with us. But somebody had to help carry Shancus. He accepted his task reluctantly, but made me promise we wouldn't face Steve without him. \"I've come too far with you to... miss out now. I want to be there when you... cut the demon down.\"</p><p>Debbie threw her arms around me before leaving. \"How could he do it?\" she cried. \"Even a monster couldn't... wouldn't...\"</p><p>\"Steve's more than a monster,\" I replied numbly. I wanted to return her embrace, but my arms wouldn't work. Alice pried her away from me. She gave Debbie a handkerchief and whispered something to her. Debbie sniffed miserably, nodded, gave Alice a hug, then went to stand beside Evra.</p><p>I wanted to talk with Evra before he left, but I could think of nothing to say. If he'd confronted me, maybe I'd have responded, but he had eyes only for his lifeless son. Dead people often look like they're sleeping. Shancus didn't. He'd been a vibrant, buzzing, active child. All that vitality was lost now. Nobody could have looked upon him and thought he was anything but dead.</p><p>I remained standing until Evra, Debbie and Harkat had departed, Harkat carrying Shancus's body tenderly in his thick, grey arms. Then I slid to the floor and sat there for ages, staring around in a daze, thinking about the past and my first visit here, using the theatre and my memories as a barrier between me and my grief.</p><p>Eventually Vancha and Alice approached. I don't know how long the pair had been talking together, but when they came to stand before me they'd wiped their faces clean of tears and looked ready for business.</p><p>\"Will I talk to the boy or do you want to?\" Vancha asked gruffly.</p><p>\"I don't care,\" I sighed. Then, glancing at Darius, who still stood alone with Evanna in the vastness of the auditorium, I said, \"I'll do it.\"</p><p>\"Darius,\" Alice called. His head rose immediately. \"Come here.\"</p><p>Darius went straight to the plank, climbed up and walked across. He had an excellent sense of balance. I found myself thinking that was probably a by-product of his vampaneze blood - Steve had pumped some of his own blood into his son, turning him into a half-vampaneze. Thinking that, I began to hate the boy again. My fingers twitched in anticipation of grabbing him by the throat and...</p><p>But then I recalled his face when he'd learnt he was my nephew - shock, terror, confusion, pain, remorse - and my hatred for the boy died away.</p><p>Darius walked directly up to us. If he was afraid - and he must have been - he masked it bravely. Stopping, he stared at Vancha, then at Alice, finally at me. Now that I studied him closely, I saw a certain family resemblance. Thinking about that, I frowned.</p><p>\"You're not the boy I saw before,\" I said. Darius looked at me uncertainly. \"I went to my old home when we first came to town,\" I explained. \"I watched from behind the fence. I saw Annie. She was bringing in laundry. Then you arrived and came out to help her. Except it wasn'tyou . It was a chubby boy with fair hair.\"</p><p>\"Oggy Bas,\" Darius said after a second's thought. \"My friend. I remember that day. He came home with me. I sent him out to help Mum while I was taking my shoes off. Oggy always does what I tell him.\" Then, licking his lips nervously, he looked around at all of us again and said, \"I didn't know.\" It wasn't an apology, just a statement of fact. \"Dad told me vampires were evil. He said you were the worst of the lot. 'Darren the cruel, Darren the mad, Darren the baby-killer.' But he never mentioned your surname.\"</p><p>Evanna had crossed the plank after Darius and was circling us, studying us as if we were chess pieces. I ignored her - there'd be time for the witch later.</p><p>\"What did Steve tell you about the vampaneze?\" I asked Darius.</p><p>\"That they wanted to stop vampires killing humans. They broke away from the clan several hundred years ago and had battled to stop the slaughter of humans ever since. They drank only small amounts of blood when they fed, just enough to survive.\"</p><p>\"You believed him?\" Vancha snorted.</p><p>\"He was my dad,\" Darius answered. \"He was always kind to me. I never saw him like I saw him tonight. I'd no reason to doubt him.\"</p><p>\"But you doubt him now,\" Alice noted wryly.</p><p>\"Yes. He's evil.\" As soon as he said it, Darius burst into tears, his brave front collapsing. It can't have been easy for a child to admit his father was evil. Even in the midst of my grief and fury, I felt pity for the boy.</p><p>\"What about Annie?\" I asked when Darius had recovered enough to speak again. \"Did Steve feed her the same sort of lies?\"</p><p>\"She doesn't know,\" Darius said. \"They haven't spoken since before I was born. I never told her I was meeting him.\"</p><p>I breathed a small sigh of relief. I'd had a sudden, terrifying flash of Annie as Steve's consort, having grown up as bitter and twisted as him. It was good to know she wasn't part of this dark insanity.</p><p>\"Do you want to tell him the truth about vampires and vampaneze, or will I?\" Vancha asked.</p><p>\"First things first,\" Alice interrupted. \"Does he know where his father is?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Darius said sadly. \"I always met him here. This is where he was based. If he has another hideout, I don't know about it.\"</p><p>\"Damn!\" Alice snarled.</p><p>\"No ideas at all?\" I asked. Darius thought for a moment, then shook his head. I glanced at Vancha. \"Will you set him straight?\"</p><p>\"Sure.\" Vancha quickly filled Darius in on the truth. He told him that the vampaneze were the ones who killed when they drank, though he was careful to describe their ways in detail - they kept part of a person's spirit alive within themselves when they drained a human dry, so they didn't look upon it as murder. They were noble. They never lied. They weren't deliberately evil.</p><p>\"Then your father came along,\" Vancha said, and explained about the Lord of the Vampaneze, the War of the Scars, Mr Tiny's prediction and our part in it.</p><p>\"I don't understand,\" Darius said at the end, forehead creased. \"If the vampaneze don't lie, how come Dad lied all the time? And he taught me how to use an arrow-gun, but you said they can't use such weapons.\"</p><p>\"They're not supposed to,\" Vancha said. \"I haven't seen or heard of any others breaking those rules. But their Lord's above such laws. They worship him so much - or fear what will happenif they disobey him - that they don't care what he does, as long as he leads them to victory over the vampires.\"</p>","<p>Darius thought about that in silence for a long time. He was only ten years old, but he had the expression and manner of someone much older.</p><p>\"I wouldn't have helped if I'd known,\" he said in the end. \"I grew up thinking vampires were evil, like in the movies. When Dad came to me a few years ago and said he was on a mission to stop them, I thought it was a great adventure. I thought he was a hero. I was proud to be his son. I'd have done anything for him. Idid ...\"</p><p>He looked like he was about to cry again. But then his jaw firmed and he stared at me. \"But how did you get involved in this?\" he asked. \"Mum told me you died. She said you broke your neck.\"</p><p>\"I faked my death,\" I said, and gave him a very brief rundown of my early life as a vampire's assistant, sacrificing everything I held dear to save Steve's life.</p><p>\"But why does he hate you if you saved him?\" Darius shouted. \"That's crazy!\"</p><p>\"Steve sees things differently,\" I shrugged. \"He believes it was his destiny to become a vampire. He thinks I stole his rightful place. He's determined to make me pay.\"</p><p>Darius shook his head, confused. \"I can't understand that,\" he said.</p><p>\"You're young.\" I smiled sadly. \"You've a lot to learn about people and how they operate.\" I fell silent, thinking that those were some of the many things poor Shancus would never learn.</p><p>\"So,\" Darius said a while later, breaking the silence.</p><p>\"What happens now?\"</p><p>\"Go home,\" I sighed. \"Forget about this. Put it behind you.\"</p><p>\"But what about the vampaneze?\" Darius cried. \"Dad's still out there. I want to help you find him.\"</p><p>\"Really?\" I looked at him icily. \"You want to help us kill him? You'd lead us to your own father and watch while we cut his rotten heart out?\"</p><p>Darius shifted uneasily. \"He's evil,\" he whispered.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I agreed. \"But he's still your father. You're better off out of this.\"</p><p>\"And Mum?\" Darius asked. \"What do I tell her?\"</p><p>\"Nothing,\" I said. \"She thinks I'm dead. Let her go on thinking that. Say nothing of this. The world I live in isn't a fit world for children - and as a child who's lived in it, I should know! Take back your ordinary life. Try not to dwell on what's happened. In time you might be able to dismiss all this as a horrible dream.\" I placed my hands on his shoulders and smiled warmly. \"Go home, Darius. Be good to Annie. Make her happy.\"</p><p>Darius wasn't pleased, but I could see him making up his mind to accept my advice. Then Vancha spoke. \"It's not that easy.\"</p><p>\"What?\" I frowned.</p><p>\"He's in. He can't opt out.\"</p><p>\"Of course he can!\" I snapped.</p><p>Vancha shook his head stubbornly. \"He was blooded. The vampaneze blood is thin in him, but it will thicken. He won't age like normal children, and in a few decades the purge will strike and he'll become a full-vampaneze.\" Vancha sighed. \"But his real problems will start long before then.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I croaked, though I sensed what he was getting at.</p><p>\"Feeding,\" Vancha said. He turned his gaze on Darius. \"You'll need to drink blood to survive.\"</p><p>Darius stiffened, then grinned shakily. \"So I'll drink like you guys,\" he said. \"A drop here, a drop there. I don't mind. It'll be kind of cool, in a way. Maybe I'll drink from my teachers and-\"</p><p>\"No,\" Vancha growled. \"You can't drink like us. In the beginning, vampaneze were the same as vampires, except in their customs. But they've changed. The centuries have altered them physically. Now a vampanezemust kill when he feeds. They're driven to it. They have no choice or control. I was once a half-vampaneze, so I know what I'm speaking about.\"</p><p>Vancha drew himself up straight and spoke sadly but firmly. \"In a few months the hunger will grow within you. You won't be able to resist. You'll drink blood because you have to, and when you drink, because you're a half-vampaneze - you'llkill !\"</p><p>Chapter TWO</p><p>We marched in silence, in single file, Darius leading the way like Oliver Twist at the head of a funeral procession. Following the massacre at the stadium after the football match, a series of road blocks had been set in place around the town. But there weren't many in this area, so we made good time, having to take only a couple of short detours. I was at the back of the line, a few metres behind the others, worrying about the meeting to come. I'd agreed to it easily enough in the theatre, but now that we were getting closer, I was having second thoughts.</p><p>While I was running through my words, thinking of all the things I could and should say, Evanna slipped back to walk along beside me. \"If it helps, the snake-boy's soul has flown straight to Paradise,\" she said.</p><p>\"I never thought otherwise,\" I replied stiffly, glaring at her hatefully.</p><p>\"Why such a dark look?\" she asked, genuine surprise in her mismatched green and brown eyes.</p><p>\"You knew it was coming,\" I growled. \"You could have warned us and saved Shancus.\"</p><p>\"No,\" she snapped, irritated. \"Why do you people level the same accusations at me over and over? You know I have the power to see into the future, but not the power to directly influence it. I cannot act to change that which is to be. Nor could my brother.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\" I snarled. \"You always say that terrible things will happen if you do, but what are they? What could be worse than letting an innocent child die at the hands of a monster?\"</p><p>Evanna was quiet a moment, then spoke softly, so that only I could hear. \"There are worse monsters than Steve Leonard, and worse even than the Lord of the Shadows - be he Steve or you. These other monsters wait in the timeless wings around the stage of the world, never seen by man, but always seeing, always hungering, always eager to break through.</p><p>\"I am bound by laws older than mankind. So was my brother and so, to a large extent, is my father. If I took advantage of the present, and tried to change the course of a future I knew about, I'd break the laws of the universe. The monsters I speak of would then be free to cross into this world, and it would become a cauldron of endless, bloody savagery.\"</p><p>\"It seems that way already,\" I said sourly.</p><p>\"For you, perhaps,\" she agreed. \"But for billions of others it is not. Would you have everyone suffer as you have - and worse?\"</p>","<p>\"Of course not,\" I muttered. \"But you told me they were going to suffer anyway, that the Lord of the Shadows will destroy mankind.\"</p><p>\"He will bring it to its knees,\" she said. \"But he will not crushit entirely. Hope will remain. One day, far in the future, humans might rise again. If I interfered and unleashed the real monsters, hope would become a word without meaning.\"</p><p>I didn't know what to think about these other monsters of Evanna's - it was the first time she'd ever spoken of such creatures - so I brought the conversation back to centre on the monster I knew all too much about. \"You're wrong when you say I can become the Lord of the Shadows,\" I said, trying to change my destiny by denying it. \"I'm not a monster.\"</p><p>\"You would have killed Darius if Steve hadn't said he was your nephew,\" Evanna reminded me.</p><p>I recalled the hateful fury which had flared to life inside me when I saw Shancus die. In that moment I became like Steve. I didn't care about right or wrong. I only wanted to hurt my enemy by killing his son. I'd seen a glimpse of my future then, the beast I could become, but I didn't want to believe it was real.</p><p>\"That would have been in revenge for Shancus,\" I said bitterly, trying to hide from the truth. \"It wouldn't have been the act of an out-of-control beast. I wouldn't become a monster just because of a single executioning.\"</p><p>\"No?\" Evanna challenged me. \"There was a time when you thought differently. Do you remember when you killed your first vampaneze, in the caves of Vampire Mountain? You wept afterwards. You thought killing was wrong. You believed there were ways to resolve differences other than through violence.\"</p><p>\"I still do,\" I said, but my words sounded hollow, even to me.</p><p>\"You would not have tried to take the life of a child if you did,\" Evanna said, stroking the hairs of her beard. \"You have changed, Darren. You're not evil like Steve, but you carry the seeds of evil within you. Your intentions are good, but time and circumstance will see you become that which you despise. This world will warp you and, despite your noble wishes, the monster within you will grow. Friends will become enemies. Truths will become lies. Beliefs will become sick jokes.\"</p><p>\"The path of revenge is always lined with danger. By following the ways of those you hate, you risk turning into them. This is your destiny, Darren Shan. You cannot avoid it. Unless Steve kills you and he becomes the Lord of the Shadows instead.\"</p><p>\"What about Vancha?\" I hissed. \"Whatif he kills Steve? Can'the become your bloody Lord of the Shadows?\"</p><p>\"No,\" she said calmly. \"Vancha has the power to kill Steve and decide the fate of the War of the Scars. But moving beyond that, it's either you or Steve. There is no other. Death or monstrosity. Those are your options.\"</p><p>She moved ahead of me then, leaving me with my troubled, frantic thoughts. Was there truly no hope for me or the world? And if not, if I was trapped between death at the hands of Steve or replacing him as the Lord of the Shadows, which was preferable? Was it better to live and terrorize the world - or die now, while I was still halfway human?</p><p>I couldn't decide on an answer. There didn't seem to be one. And so I trudged along miserably and let my thoughts return to the more pressing issue - what to say to my grown-up sister who'd buried me as a child.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Darius opened the back door and held it ajar. I paused, staring at the house, filled with a sense of foreboding. Vancha and Alice were behind me, and Evanna further behind them. I looked back at my friends pleadingly. \"Do I really have to do this?\" I croaked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Vancha said. \"It would be wrong to risk his life without informing his mother first. She must decide.\"</p><p>\"OK,\" I sighed. \"You'll wait out here till I call?\"</p><p>\"Aye.\"</p><p>I gulped, then stepped over the threshold into the house where I'd lived as a boy. After eighteen long years of wandering, I'd finally come home.</p><p>Darius guided me to the living room, though I could have foundmy way blindfolded. Much had changed within the house - new wallpaper and carpets, furniture and light fittings - but it felt the same, warm and comfy, layered with memories of the distant past. It was like walking through a ghost house - except the house was real and I was the ghost.</p><p>Darius pushed the living-room door open. And there was Annie, her brown hair tied up in a bun, sitting in a chair in front of the TV, sipping hot chocolate, watching the news. \"Decided to come home at last, did you?\" she said to Darius, catching sight of him out of the corner of her eye. She laid the cup of hot chocolate down. \"I was worried. Have you seen the news? There's-\"</p><p>She saw me entering the room after Darius. \"Is this one of your friends?\" she asked. I could see her thinking I looked too old to be his friend. She was instantly suspicious of me.</p><p>\"Hello, Annie,\" I said, smiling nervously, advancing into the light.</p><p>\"Have we met before?\" she asked, frowning, not recognizing me.</p><p>\"In a way,\" I chuckled drily.</p><p>\"Mum, it's-\" Darius started to say.</p><p>\"No,\" I interrupted. \"Let her see for herself. Don't tell her.\"</p><p>\"Tell me what?\" Annie snapped. She was squinting at me now, uneasy.</p><p>\"Look closer, Annie,\" I said softly, walking across the room, stopping less than a metre away from her.</p><p>\"Look at my eyes. They say the eyes never really change, even if everything else does.\" \"Your voice,\" she muttered. \"There's something about...\" She stood - she was the same height as me</p><p>- and gazed steadily into my eyes. I smiled. \"You look like somebody I knew a long time ago,\" Annie said. \"But I don't remember who...\" \"You did know me a long time ago,\" I whispered. \"Eighteen years ago.\" \"Nonsense!\" Annie snorted. \"You'd have only been a baby.\" \"No,\" I said. \"I've aged slowly. I was slightly older than Darius when you last saw me.\" \"Is this a joke?\" she half laughed. \"Look at him, Mum,\" Darius said intently. \"Reallylook at him.\" And she did. And this time I saw something in her expression and realized she'd known who I was the second she saw me - she just hadn't admitted it to herself yet.</p><p>\"Listen to your instincts, Annie,\" I said. \"You always had good instincts. If I'd had your nose for trouble, maybe I wouldn't have gotten into this mess. Maybe I'd have had more sense than to steal a poisonous spider...\"</p>","<p>Annie's eyes widened. \"No!\" she gasped.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said.</p><p>\"You can't be!\"</p><p>\"I am.\"</p><p>\"But...No !\" she growled, firmly this time. \"I don't know who put you up to this, or what you think you'll achieve by it, but if you don't get out quick, I'll-\"</p><p>\"I bet you never told anyone about Madam Octa,\" I cut her off. She trembled at mention of the spider's name. \"I bet you kept that secret all these years. You must have guessed she had something to do with my 'death'. Maybe you asked Steve about it, since he was the one she bit, but I bet you never told Mum or-\"</p><p>\"Darren?\" she wheezed, confused tears springing to her eyes.</p><p>\"Hi, sis,\" I grinned. \"Long time no see.\"</p><p>She stared at me, appalled, and then did something I thought only happened in corny old movies - her eyes rolled up, her legs gave way, and she fainted!</p><p>Annie sat in her chair, a fresh mug of hot chocolate cupped between her hands. I sat opposite her in a chair I'd dragged over from the other side of the room. Darius stood by the TV, which he'd turned off shortly after Annie fainted. Annie hadn't said much since recovering. Once she'd come to, she'd pressed back into her chair, gazed at me, torn between horror and hope, and simply gasped, \"How?\"</p><p>I'd spent the time since then filling her in. I spoke quietly and rapidly, starting with Mr Crepsley and Madam Octa, explaining the deal I'd struck to save Steve's life, giving her a quick rundown of the years since then; my existence as a vampire, the vampaneze, the War of the Scars, tracking the Vampaneze Lord. I didn't tell her Steve was the Lord or involved with the vampaneze - I wanted to see how she reacted to the rest of the story before hitting her with that one.</p><p>Her eyes didn't betray her feelings. It was impossible to guess what she was thinking. When I got to the part of thestory involving Darius, her gaze slid from me to her son, and she leant forward slightly as I described how he'd been tricked into aiding the vampaneze,, again being careful not to refer to Steve by name. I finished with my return to the old cinema theatre, Shancus's death, and the Vampaneze Lord's revelation that Darius was my nephew.</p><p>\"Once Darius knew the truth, he was horrified,\" I said. \"But I told him he mustn't blame himself. Lots of older and wiser people than him have been fooled by the Lord of the Vampaneze.\"</p><p>I stopped and awaited her reaction. It wasn't long coming.</p><p>\"You're insane,\" she said coldly. \"If youare my brother - and I'm not a hundred per cent convinced - then whatever disease stunted your growth also affected your brain. Vampires? Vampaneze? My son in league with a killer?\" She sneered. \"You're a madman.\"</p><p>\"But it's true!\" Darius exclaimed. \"He can prove it! He's stronger and faster than any human. He can-\"</p><p>\"Be quiet!\" Annie roared with such venom that Darius shut up instantly. She glared at me furiously. \"Get out of my house,\" she snarled. \"Stay away from my son. Don't ever come back.\"</p><p>\"But-\" I began.</p><p>\"No!\" she screamed. \"You're not my brother! Even if you are, you're not! We buried Darren eighteen years ago. He's dead and that's the way I want him to stay. I don't care if you're him or not. I want you out of my life -our lives - immediately.\" She stood and pointed at the door. \"Go!\"</p><p>I didn't move. I wanted to. If it hadn't been for Darius, I would have slunk out like a kicked dog. But she had to know what her son had become. I couldn't leave without convincing her of the danger he was in.</p><p>While Annie stood, pointing at the door, hand trembling wildly, face twisted with rage, Darius stepped away from the TV \"Mum,\" he said quietly. \"Don't you want to know how I fell in with the vampaneze and why I helped them?\"</p><p>\"There are no vampaneze!\" she yelled. \"This maniac has filled your imagination with lies and-\"</p><p>\"Steve Leonard's the Lord of the Vampaneze,\" Darius said, and Annie stopped dead. \"He came to me a few years ago,\" Darius went on, edging slowly towards her. \"At first we just went for walks together, he took me to the cinema and for meals, stuff like that. He told me not to say anything to you. He said you wouldn't like it, that you'd make him go away.\"</p><p>He stopped in front of her, reached up, took hold of her pointing hand and gently bent her arm down. She was staring at him wordlessly. \"He's my dad,\" Darius said sadly. \"I trusted him because I thought he loved me. That's why I believed him when he told me about vampires. He said he was telling me for my protection, that he was worried about me - andyou . He wanted to protect us. That's where it began. Then I got more involved. He taught me how to use a knife, how to shoot, how to kill.\"</p><p>Annie sank back into her chair, unable to respond.</p><p>\"It was Steve,\" Darius said. \"Steve who got me into trouble, who killed the snake-boy, who made Darren come back to see you. Darren didn't want to - he knew he'd hurt you - but Steve left him with no choice. It's true, Mum, everything he said. You've got to believe us, because it was Steve, and I think he might come back - come afteryou - and if we aren't ready... if you don't believe...\"</p><p>He ground to a halt, running out of words. But he'd said enough. When Annie looked at me again, there was fear and doubt in her eyes, but no scorn. \"Steve?\" she moaned. I nodded unhappily and her face hardened. \"What did I tell you about him?\" she screamed at Darius, grabbing the boy and shaking him angrily. \"I told you never to go near him! That if you ever saw him, you had to run and tell me! I said he was dangerous!\"</p><p>\"I didn't believe you!\" Darius cried. \"I thought you hated him just because he ran away, that you were lying! He was my dad!\" He tore himself away from her and collapsed on the floor, weeping. \"He was my dad,\" he sobbed again. \"Iloved him.\"</p><p>Annie stared at Darius crying. Then she stared at me. And then she also started to cry, and her sobs were even deeper and more painful than her son's.</p><p>I didn't cry. I was saving my tears. I knew the worst was yet to come.</p><p>Chapter THREE</p><p>Later. After the tears. Sitting around the living room. Annie had recovered from the worst of the shock. All three of us were drinking hot chocolate. I hadn't called the others in yet - I wanted some personal time with Annie before I dumped the full fallout from the War of the Scars upon her.</p>","<p>Annie made me tell her more about my life. She wanted to hear about the countries I'd visited, the people I'd met, the adventures I'd had. I told her some of the highlights, leaving out the darker aspects. She listened, dazed, touching me every few minutes to make sure I was real. When she heard I was a Prince, she laughed with delight. \"Does that make me a princess?\" she smiled.</p><p>\"Afraid not,\" I chuckled.</p><p>In return, Annie told me what her life had been like. The hard months after I'd 'died'. Slowly returning to normal. She was young, so she recovered, but Mum and Dad never really got over it. She raised the question of whether or not they should be told I was alive. Then, before I could speak, she said, \"No. They're happy now. It's too late to change the past. Best not to drag it up again.\"</p><p>I paid close attention when she spoke about Steve. \"I was a teenager,\" she said angrily, \"mixed-up and unsure of myself. I had some friends but not many. And no serious boyfriend. Then Steve came back. He was only a few years older than me, but he looked and acted grown-up. And he was interested in me. He wanted to talk to me. He treated me like an equal.\"</p><p>They spent a lot of time together. Steve put on a good act - kind, generous, loving. Annie thought he cared for her, that they had a future together. She fell in love with him, and gave her love to him. Then she found out she was expecting a baby.</p><p>\"His face lit up when he heard,\" she said, shivering from the memory. Darius was by her side, solemn, silent, listening intently. \"He made me believe he was delighted, that we'd get married and have lots of children together. He told me not to tell anyone - he wanted to keep it secret until we were husband and wife. He went away again. He said it was to earn money, to pay for our wedding and the baby's upkeep. He stayed away a long time. He returned late one night, while I was sleeping. Woke me up. Before I could say anything, he clamped a hand over my mouth and laughed. 'Too late to stop it now!' he mocked me. He said other things, horrible things. Then he left. I haven't heard from him since.\"</p><p>She had to tell Mum and Dad about the baby then. They were furious - not with her, but with Steve. Dad would have killed Steve if he'd found him. But nobody knew where Steve was. He'd vanished.</p><p>\"Raising Darius was hard,\" she smiled, ruffling his hair, \"but I wouldn't give up a day of it. Steve was wicked, but he gave me the most marvellous gift anyone could have ever given me.\"</p><p>\"Soppy old cow,\" Darius grunted, fighting hard not to smile.</p><p>I was quiet a long time after that. I wondered if Steve had meant to use Darius against me even then. This was back before he met the vampaneze and learnt of his abominable destiny. But I bet he was already planning my downfall, one way or the other. Did he deliberately get Annie pregnant, so he could use his nephew or niece to hurt me? Knowing Steve as I did, I guessed those were his exact intentions.</p><p>Annie started telling me about her life with Darius, from how Mum and Dad helped rear him until they moved away, how the pair were managing now on their own. She worried about him not having a father, but her experience with Steve had made her wary of men, and she found it hard to trust anyone. I could have listened to Annie talk all night, telling tales about Mum, Dad and Darius. I was catching up on all those missed years. I felt like part of the family again. I didn't want it to stop.</p><p>But we were in the middle of a crisis. I'd delayed the moment of truth, but now I had to tell her about it. The night was drawing on, and I was keen to conclude the business I'd come about. I let her finish the story she was telling - about Darius's first week in school - then asked if I could introduce her to some of my friends.</p><p>Annie wasn't sure what to make of Vancha, Alice and Evanna. Alice dressed normally, but Vancha in his animal hides, with his straps of throwing stars and green hair, and the hirsute, deliriously ugly Evanna draped in ropes... They would have stuck out like a couple of gargoyles anywhere!</p><p>But they were my friends (well, Vancha and Alice were, whatever about the witch), so Annie welcomed them - though I could tell she didn't entirely trust the trio. And I knew she sensed they weren't here just to make up the numbers. She guessed that something bad was coming.</p><p>We made small talk for a while. Alice told Annie about her years on the police force, Vancha described some of his Princely duties and Evanna gave her tips on how to breed frogs (not that Annie had any interest in that!). Then Darius yawned. Vancha looked at me meaningfully - it was time.</p><p>\"Annie,\" I started hesitantly, \"I told you Darius pledged himself to the vampaneze. But I didn't tell you what precisely that means.\"</p><p>\"Go on,\" Annie said when I stalled.</p><p>\"Steve blooded him,\" I said. \"He transferred some of his vampaneze blood to Darius. The blood isn't very strong within him, but it will strengthen. The cells will multiply and take over.\"</p><p>\"You're saying he'll become like you?\" Annie's face was ashen. \"He won't age normally? He'll need to drink blood to survive?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" Her face crumpled - she thought that was the worst, the part I'd been holding back. I wished I could spare her the truth, but I couldn't. \"There's more,\" I said, and she stiffened. \"Vampires can control their feeding habits. It isn't easy - it requires training - but we can. Vampaneze can't. Their blood forces them to kill every time they feed.\"</p><p>\"No!\" Annie moaned. \"Darius isn't a killer! He wouldn't!\"</p><p>\"He would,\" Vancha grunted. \"He'd have no choice. Once a vampaneze gets the taste of blood, his urges consume him. He goes into a kind of trance and feeds until he's drained the source dry. He can't stop.\"</p><p>\"But there must be some way to help him!\" Annie insisted. \"Doctors... surgery... medicine...\"</p><p>\"No,\" Vancha said. \"This isn't a human disease. Your doctors could study him, and restrain him while he was feeding - but do you want your son to spend his life imprisoned?\"</p><p>\"Also,\" I said, \"they couldn't stop him when he was older. As he comes into his full powers, he'll grow incredibly strong. They'd have to keep him comatose to control him.\"</p><p>\"No!\" Annie shouted, her face dark with stubborn rage. \"I won't allow this! There must be a way to save him!\"</p><p>\"There is,\" I said, and she relaxed slightly. \"But it's dangerous. And it won't restore his humanity - it will merely drive him towards a different corner of the night.\"</p>","<p>\"Don't talk in riddles!\" Annie snapped. \"What does he have to do?\" \"Become a vampire,\" I said. Annie stared at me in disbelief. \"It's not as bad as it sounds,\" I went on quickly. \"Yes, he'd age slowly, but that's something you and he</p><p>could learn to cope with. And yes, he'd have to drink blood, but he wouldn't harm when he drank. We'd teach him to master his urges.\" \"No,\" Annie said. \"There must be another way.\"</p><p>\"There isn't,\" Vancha huffed. \"And even this way isn't certain. Nor is it safe.\" \"I'll have to trade blood with him,\" I explained. \"Pump my vampire cells into his body, and accept his vampaneze cells into mine. The vampire and vampaneze cells will attack each other. If all goes well, Darius will become a half-vampire and I'll carry on as before.\"</p><p>\"But if it fails, you'll become a half-vampaneze and Darius won't change?\" Annie guessed, trembling at the thought of such a horrible fate. \"No,\" I said. \"It's worse that that. If it fails, I'll die - and so will Darius.\" And then I sat back numbly and awaited her decision.</p><p>Chapter FOUR</p><p>Annie didn't like it - nobody did! - but we eventually convinced her that there was no other solution. She wanted to wait, think it over and discuss it with her doctor, but I told her it was now or never. \" Vancha and I have a mission to complete,\" I reminded her. \"We might not be able to come back later.\"</p><p>When we'd first discussed the transfusion, Vancha had volunteered. He didn't think it was safe for me to try. I was in the middle of the purge - my vampire cells were taking over, turning me into a full-vampire, and my body was in a state of flux. But when I pressed him, he admitted there was no real reason for thinking that the purge would have any effect on the procedure. It might even work in our favour - since my vampire cells were hyperactive, they might stand a better chance of destroying the vampaneze cells.</p><p>We'd tried to quiz Evanna about the dangers. She could look into the future and tell us whether it would succeed or not. But she refused to be drawn. \"This has nothing to do with me,\" she'd said. \"I will not comment on it.\"</p><p>\"But it must be safe,\" I'd pressed, hoping for reassurance. \"We're destined to meet Steve again. We can't do that if I die.\"</p><p>\"Your final encounter with Steve Leonard is by no means set in stone,\" she'd replied. \"If you die beforehand, he will become the Lord of the Shadows by default and the war will swing the way of the vampaneze. Do not think you are immune to danger because of your destiny, Darren - youcan and perhapswill die if you attempt this.\"</p><p>But Darius was my nephew. Vancha didn't approve - he would have preferred to overlook Darius for the time being, and focus on Steve - but I couldn't leave the boy this way, with such a threat hanging over him. If I could save him, I must.</p><p>We could have handled the blood transfer with syringes, but Darius insisted on the traditional fingertips method. He was excited, despite the danger, and wanted to do it the old way. \"If I'm going to be a vampire, I want to be a real one,\" he growled. \"I don't want to hide my marks. It's all or nothing.\"</p><p>\"But it'll be painful,\" I warned him.</p><p>\"I don't care,\" he sniffed.</p><p>Annie's doubts remained, burin the end she agreed to the plan. She might not have if Darius had wavered, but he stuck to his guns with grim determination. I hated to admit it - and I didn't say it out loud - but he had his father's sense of commitment. Steve was insanely evil, but he always did what he set out to do, and nothing could change his mind once he'd made it up. Darius was the same.</p><p>\"I can't believe this is happening,\" Annie sighed as I sat opposite Darius and prepared to drive my nails into the tips of his fingers. \"Earlier tonight I was only thinking about doing the shopping tomorrow, and being here to let Darius in when he got home from school. Then my brother walks back into my life and tells me he's a vampire! And now, as I'm just getting used to that, I might lose him as swiftly as I found him - and my son too!\"</p><p>She almost called it off then, but Alice stepped up behind her and said softly, \"Would you rather lose him when he's human, or when he's a killer like his father?\" It was a cruel thing to say, but it steadied Annie's nerves and reminded her of what was at stake. Trembling fiercely, weeping quietly, she stepped away and let me proceed.</p><p>Without any warning, I dug my nails into the soft flesh at the tips of Darius's fingers. He yelped painfully and jerked back in his chair. \"Don't,\" I said as he raised his fingers to his mouth to suck them. \"Let them bleed.\"</p><p>Darius lowered his hands. Gritting my teeth, I dug my right-hand nails into my left-hand fingertips, then did it the other way round. Blood welled up from ten fleshy springs. I pressed my fingers against Darius's and held them there while my blood flowed into his body, and his into mine.</p><p>We remained locked for twenty seconds... thirty... more. I could feel the vampaneze cells as soon as his blood entered my veins, itching, burning, sizzling. I ignored the pain. I could see that Darius was also aware of the change, and that it was hurting him more than me. I pressed closer against him, so it was impossible for him to break away.</p><p>Vancha stood guard, observing us, calculating. When he thought the time was right, he grabbed my arms and pulled my hands away. I gasped out loud, stood, half smiled, then fell to the floor, writhing in agony. I hadn't expected the cells to kick in so soon, and was unprepared for the brutal speed of the reaction.</p><p>During my convulsions, I saw Darius twisting sharply in his chair, eyes bulging, making choking noises, arms and legs thrashing wildly. Annie hurried towards him but Vancha knocked her aside. \"Don't interfere!\" he barked. \"Nature must take its course. We can't get in its way.\"</p><p>For several minutes I jackknifed wildly on the floor. It felt like I was on fire inside my skin. I'd experienced blinding headaches and loads of discomfort during the purge, but this took me to new heights of pain. Pressure built at the back of my eyes, as though my brain was going to bulge out through my eye sockets. I dug the heels of my hands hard into my eyes, then into the sides of my head. I don't know if I was roaring or wheezing - I could hear nothing.</p><p>I vomited, then dry-heaved. I crashed into something hard - the TV I rolled away from it and smashed into a wall. I dug my nails into the plaster and brick, trying to make the pain go away.</p>","<p>Finally the pressure subsided. My limbs relaxed. I stopped dry-heaving. Sight and sound returned, though my fierce headache remained. I looked around, dazed. Vancha was crouching over me, wiping my face clean, smiling. \"You've come through it,\" he said. \"You'll be OK - with the luck of the vampires.\"</p><p>\"Darius?\" I gasped.</p><p>Vancha raised my head and pointed. Darius was lying on the couch, eyes closed, perfectly still, Annie and Alice kneeling beside him. Evanna sat in a corner, head bowed. For a horrifying moment I thought Darius was dead. Then I saw his chest lift softly and fall, and I knew he was just asleep.</p><p>\"He'll be fine,\" Vancha said. \"We'll have to keep a close eye on the two of you for a few nights. You'll probably have further fits, less severe than this one. But most who attempt this die of the first seizure. Having survived that, the odds are good for both of you.\"</p><p>I sat up wearily. Vancha took my fingers and spat on them, rubbing his spit in to help close the wounds.</p><p>\"I feel awful,\" I moaned.</p><p>\"You won't improve any time soon,\" Vancha said. \"When I turned from vampanizm to vampirism it took my system a month to settle down, and almost a year to get back to normal. And you've got the purge to contend with too.\" He chuckled wryly. \"You're in for some rough nights, Sire!\"</p><p>Vancha helped me back to my chair. Alice asked if I'd like water or milk to drink. Vancha said blood would be better for me. Without blinking, Alice used a knife to cut herself and let me feed directly from the wound. Vancha closed the cut with his spit when I was finished. He beamed up at Alice. \"You're some woman, Miss Burgess.\"</p><p>\"The best,\" Alice replied dryly.</p><p>I leant back, eyes half closed. \"I could sleep for a week,\" I sighed.</p><p>\"Why don't you?\" Vancha said. \"You've only recently recovered from a life-threatening wound. You're in the middle of the purge. You've pulled off the most dangerous blood transfusion known to vampires. By the black blood of Harnon Oan, you've earned a rest!\"</p><p>\"But Steve...\" I muttered.</p><p>\"Leonard can wait,\" Vancha grunted. \"We'll send Annie land Darius out of town - Alice will escort them - then get you settled in at the Cirque. A week in your hammock will do you the world of good.\"</p><p>\"I guess,\" I said unhappily. I was thinking about Evra and Merla, and what I could find to say to them. There was Mr Tall to consider too - everyone at the Cirque Du Freak had loved him. Like Shancus, he was dead because of his association with me. Would the people there hate me because of that?</p><p>\"Who do you think will take over from Mr Tall?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I've no idea,\" Vancha said. \"I don't think anybody ever expected him to die, certainly not in such sudden circumstances.\"</p><p>\"Maybe they'll break up,\" I mused. \"Go their own ways, back to whatever they did before they joined. Some might have left the stadium already. I hope-\"</p><p>\"What was that about a stadium?\" Annie interrupted. She was still tending to Darius - he was snoring lightly - but she'd overheard us talking.</p><p>\"The Cirque Du Freak's camped in the old football stadium,\" I explained. \"We're going back there when you leave, but I was saying to Vancha that-\"</p><p>\"The news,\" Annie interrupted again. \"You didn't see tonight's news?\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"I was watching it when you came in,\" she said, eyes filling with fresh worry. \"I didn't know that's where you were based, so I didn't connect it with you.\"</p><p>\"Connect what?\" I asked edgily.</p><p>\"Police have surrounded the stadium,\" Annie said. \"They say the people who killed Tom Jones and the others at the football match are there. I should have put it together earlier, when you were telling me about Tommy, but...\" She shook her head angrily, then continued. \"They're not letting anyone in or out. When I was watching the news, they hadn't moved in yet. But they said that when they did, they'd go in with full, lethal force. One of the reporters-\" She stopped.</p><p>\"Go on,\" I said hoarsely.</p><p>\"He said he'd never seen so many armed police before. He...\" She gulped and finished in a whisper. \"He said they meant to go in as hard as they could. He said it looked like they planned to kill everyone inside.\"</p><p>Chapter FIVE</p><p>First things first - make sure Annie and Darius got away safely. I couldn't concentrate on helping my friends trapped inside the stadium if I was worrying about my sister and nephew. Once they were free of Steve's influence, safe somewhere he couldn't find them, I could focus on business entirely. Until that time I would only be a distracted liability.</p><p>Annie didn't want to go. This was her home and she wanted to fight to protect it. When, after telling her about some of the atrocities Steve had committed over the years, I convinced her they had to leave, she insisted I go with them.</p><p>For years she'd believed I was dead. Now she knew otherwise, she didn't want to lose me again so quickly.</p><p>\"I can't come,\" I sighed. \"Not while my friends are in danger. Later, when it's over, I'll find you.\"</p><p>\"Not if Steve kills you!\" Annie cried. I had no answer for that one. \"What about Darius?\" she pressed. \"You said he needs training. What will he do without you?\"</p><p>\"Give us your mobile number,\" I said. \" Alice will contact her people before we go to the stadium. In the worst case scenario, somebody will get in touch. A vampire will link up with you and instruct Darius, or guide him to Vampire Mountain, where Seba or Vanez can look after him.\"</p><p>\"Who?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Old friends,\" I smiled. \"They can teach him everything he'll ever need to know about being a vampire.\"</p><p>Annie kept trying to change my mind, telling me my place was with her and Darius, that I was her brother before I became a vampire and I should think of her first. But she was wrong. I left the human world behind when I became a Vampire Prince. I still cared for Annie and loved her, but my first loyalty was to the clan.</p><p>When she realized she couldn't win me round, Annie bundled Darius into the back of their car - he was still sound asleep - and tearfully went to gather some personal belongings. I told her to take as much as she could, and not to come back. If we defeated Steve, she and Darius could return. If not, somebody would fetch the rest of her stuff. The house would have to be sold, and they'd remain in hiding under the protection of the vampire clan, for as long as the clan was capable of looking after them. (I didn't say \"Until the clan falls,\" but that's what I was thinking.) It wouldn't be an ideal life - but it would be better than winding up in the hands of Steve Leopard.</p>","<p>Annie hugged me with all her strength before getting into the car. \"It's not fair,\" she wept. \"There's so much you haven't told me, so much I want to know, so much I want to say.\"</p><p>\"Me too,\" I said, blinking away tears. It was a weird feeling. Everything was happening at ten times the speed it should. It had only been a few hours since we returned to the Cirque Du Freak to chat with Mr Tall, but it felt like weeks had passed. His death, the chase, Morgan James's beheading, the theatre, Shancus being slaughtered by Steve, finding out about Darius, coming to see my sister... I wanted to put my foot down on the brake, take time out, make sense of all that was going on. But life makes its own rules and sets its own pace. Sometimes you can rein it in and slow it down - other times you can't.</p><p>\"You really can't come with us?\" Annie tried one last time.</p><p>\"No,\" I said. \"I want to... but no.\"</p><p>\"Then I wish you all the luck in the world, Darren,\" she moaned. She kissed me, began to say something else, then broke down in tears. Hurling herself into the car, she checked on Darius, then started the engine and roared away, disappearing into the night, leaving me standing outside my old home - heartbroken.</p><p>\"Are you all right?\" Alice asked, creeping up behind me.</p><p>\"I will be,\" I replied, wiping tears from my eyes. \"I wish I'd been able to say goodbye to Darius.\"</p><p>\"It's not goodbye,\" Alice said. \"Just au revoir !\"</p><p>\"Hopefully,\" I sighed, though I didn't really believe it. Win or lose, I had a sick feeling in my stomach that tonight was the last time I'd ever see Annie and Darius. I paused a moment to wish them a silent farewell, then turned around, put them from my thoughts, and let all my emotions and energies centre on the problems to hand and the dangers faced by my friends at the Cirque Du Freak.</p><p>Inside the house, we discussed our next move. Alice was for getting out of town as quickly as possible, abandoning our friends and allies. \"Three of us can't make a difference if there are hordes of police stationed around the stadium,\" she argued. \"Steve Leonard remains the priority. The others will have to fend for themselves.\"</p><p>\"But they're our friends,\" I muttered. \"We can't just abandon them.\"</p><p>\"We must,\" she insisted. \"It doesn't matter how much it hurts. We can't do anything for them now, not without placing our own lives in jeopardy.\"</p><p>\"But Evra... Harkat... Debbie !\"</p><p>\"I know,\" she said, her eyes sad but hard. \"But like I said, it doesn't matter how much it hurts. We have to leave them.\"</p><p>\"I don't agree,\" I said. \"I think...\" I stopped, reluctant to voice my belief.</p><p>\"Go on,\" Vancha encouraged me.</p><p>\"I can't explain it,\" I said slowly, eyes flicking to Evanna, \"but I think Steve's there. At the stadium. Waiting for us. He set the police on us before - when Alice was one of them - and I can't see him pulling the same trick twice. It would be boring the second time round. He craves originality and new thrills. I think the police outside are just for cover.\"</p><p>\"He could have set a trap in the cinema theatre,\" Vancha mused, taking up my train of thought. \"But that wouldn't have been as elaborate a setting as where we fought him before - in the Cavern of Retribution.\"</p><p>\"Exactly,\" I said. \"This is our big showdown. He'll want to go out on a high, with something outlandish. He's as much of a performer as anyone at the Cirque Du Freak. He loves theatrics. He'd relish the idea of a stadium setting. It would be like the ancient gladiator duels in the Colosseum.\"</p><p>\"We're in trouble if you're wrong,\" Alice said uneasily.</p><p>\"Nothing new about that,\" Vancha huffed. He cocked an eyebrow at Evanna. \"Care to drop us a hint?\"</p><p>To our astonishment, the witch nodded soberly. \"Darren is right. You either go to the stadium now and face your destiny, or flee and hand victory to the vampaneze.\"</p><p>\"I thought you couldn't tell us stuff like that,\" Vancha said, startled.</p><p>\"The endgame has commenced,\" Evanna answered cryptically. \"I can speak more openly about certain matters now, without altering the future.\"</p><p>\"It'd alter it if we turned tail and ran like hell for the hills,\" Vancha grunted.</p><p>\"No,\" Evanna smiled. \"It wouldn't. As I said, that would simply mean the vampaneze win. Besides,\" she added, her smile widening, \"you aren't going to run, are you?\"</p><p>\"Not in a million years!\" Vancha said, spitting against the wall for added emphasis. \"But we won't be fools about this either. I say we check out the stadium. If it looks like Leonard's in residence, we'll force a way in and chop the fiend's head off. If not, we'll search elsewhere and the circus folk will have to make their own luck. No point risking our lives for them at this stage, aye, Darren?\"</p><p>I thought of my freakish friends - Evra, Merla, Hans Hands and the rest. I thought of Harkat and Debbie, and what might happen to them. And then I thought of my people - the vampires - and what would happen to the clan if we threw our lives away trying to save our non-vampire allies.</p><p>\"Aye,\" I said miserably, and though I knew I was doing the right thing, I felt like a traitor.</p><p>Alice and Vancha checked their weapons while I armed myself with some sharp kitchen knives. Alice made a few phone calls, arranging protection for Annie and Darius. Then, with Evanna in tow, we pulled out and I left my childhood home for the second time in my life, certain in my heart that I'd never again return.</p><p>Chapter SIX</p><p>The journey across town passed without incident. All the police seemed to have been sent or drawn to the stadium. We didn't run into any road blocks or foot patrols. In fact we met hardly anyone. It was eerily quiet. People were in their homes or in pubs, watching the siege on TV, waiting for the actions kick off. It was a silence I knew from the past, the silence that usually comes before battle and death.</p><p>Dozens of police cars and vans were parked in a ring around the stadium when we arrived, and armed guards stood watching every possible entry or exit point. Barriers had been erected to keep back the public and media. Ultra-bright spotlights were trained on the walls of the stadium. My eyes watered from the glare of the lights, even from a long way off, and I had to stop and tie a strip of thick cloth around them.</p>","<p>\"Are you sure you're up to this?\" Alice asked, studying me doubtfully.</p><p>\"I'll do what I have to,\" I growled, although I wasn't as convinced of my vow as I pretended to be. I was in rough shape, the roughest I'd been since my trip down the stream and through the stomach of Vampire Mountain when I'd failed my Trials of Initiation. The purge, my shoulder wound, overall exhaustion and the blood transfer had sapped me of most of my energy. I wanted only to sleep, not face a fight to the death. But in life we don't usually get to choose the time of our defining moments. We just have to stand and face them when they come, no matter what sort of a state we're in.</p><p>A large crowd had gathered around the barriers. We mingled among them, unnoticed by the police in the darkness and crush of people - even the weirdly dressed Vancha and Evanna failed to draw attention. As we gradually pushed our way to the front, we saw thick clouds of smoke rising from within the stadium, and heard the occasional gun report.</p><p>\"What's happening?\" Alice asked the people nearest the barrier. \"Have the police moved in?\"</p><p>\"Not yet,\" a burly man in a hunter's cap informed her. \"But a small advance team went in an hour ago. Must be some new crack unit. Most of them had shaved heads and were dressed in brown shirts and black trousers.\"</p><p>\"Their eyes were painted red!\" a young boy gasped. \"I think it was blood!\"</p><p>\"Don't be ridiculous,\" his mother laughed. \"That was just paint, so the glare of the lights wouldn't blind them.\"</p><p>We withdrew, troubled by this new information. As we were leaving, I heard the boy say, \"Mummy, one of those women was dressed in ropes.'\"</p><p>His mother responded with a sharp, \"Stop making up stories.'\"</p><p>\"Sounds like you were right,\" Alice said when we were at a safe distance. \"The vampets are here, and they generally don't go anywhere without their masters.\"</p><p>\"But why did the police let them in?\" I asked. \"They can't be working for the vampaneze - can they?\"</p><p>We looked at each other uncertainly. Vampires and vampaneze had always kept their battles private, out of the gaze of humanity. Although both sides were in the process of putting together an army of select human helpers, they'd kept the war secret from humans in general. If the vampaneze had broken that age-old custom and were working with regular human forces, it signalled a worrying new twist in the War of the Scars.</p><p>\"I can still pass for a police officer,\" Alice said. \"Wait here. I'll try to find out more about this.\"</p><p>She slipped forward, through the crowd and past the barrier. She was immediately challenged by a policeman, but following a quick, hushed conversation, she was led away to talk to whoever was in command.</p><p>Vancha and I waited anxiously, Evanna standing calmly nearby. I took the time to analyse my situation. I was weak, dangerously so, and my senses were going haywire. My head was pounding and my limbs were trembling. I'd told Alice I was up for a fight, but in all honesty I couldn't say whether or not I'd be able to fend for myself. It would have been wiser to retreat and recover. But Steve had forced this battle. He was calling the shots. I'd have to struggle along as best I could and pray to the gods of the vampires for strength.</p><p>I started thinking about Evanna's prophecy again as I waited. If Vancha and I faced Steve this night, one of the three of us would die. If it was Vancha or me, Steve would become the Lord of the Shadows and the vampaneze would rule the night, as well as the world of mankind. But if Steve died, I'd become the Lord instead of him, turn on Vancha and destroy the world.</p><p>There must be some way to change that. But how? Try to make peace with Steve? Impossible! I wouldn't even if I could, not after what he'd done to Mr Crepsley, Tommy, Shancus and so many others. Peace wasn't an option.</p><p>But what other way was there? I couldn't accept the fact that the world was damned. I didn't care what Evanna said. There must be a way to stop the Lord of the Shadows from rising. There must ...</p><p>Alice returned ten minutes later, her features dark. \"They're dancing to a vampaneze tune,\" she said shortly. \"I pretended I was an out-of-town chief inspector. I offered my assistance. The ranking officer said they had everything under control. I asked about the brown-shirted soldiers and he told me they were a special government force. He didn't say as much, but I got the feeling he's taking orders from them. I don't know if they've bribed or threatened him, but they're pulling his strings, no doubt about it.\"</p><p>\"So you couldn't persuade him to let us in?\" Vancha asked.</p><p>\"I didn't have to,\" Alice said. \"A way's already open. One rear entrance has been left unblocked. The approaching path is being kept clear. The police around that point aren't to interfere with anyone going in.\"</p><p>\"He told you that?\" I asked, surprised.</p><p>\"He was under orders to tell anyone who asked,\" Alice said. She spat on the ground with disgust. \"Traitor!\"</p><p>Vancha looked at me with a thin smile. \"Leonard's in there, isn't he?\"</p><p>\"No doubt about it,\" I nodded. \"He wouldn't miss something like this.\"</p><p>Vancha cocked a thumb at the walls of the stadium. \"He's laid this on for our benefit. We're the guests of honour. Be a shame to disappoint him.\"</p><p>\"We probably won't come out of there alive if we go in,\" I noted.</p><p>\"That's negative thinking,\" Vancha tutted.</p><p>\"Then we're going to proceed?\" Alice asked. \"We're going to push on, even though we're outnumbered and outgunned?\"</p><p>\"Aye,\" Vancha said after a moment's thought. \"I'm too long in the tooth to start bothering with wisdom now!\"</p><p>I grinned at my fellow Prince. Alice shrugged. Evanna remained as blank-faced as ever. Then, without discussing it any further, we slipped around back to the unguarded entrance.</p><p>The lights weren't as bright at the rear of the stadium, and there weren't many people. Lots of police were about, but they deliberately ignored us, as they'd been told to. As we were about to advance through the gap in the ranks of police, Alice stopped us. \"I've had an idea,\" she said hesitantly. \"If we all go in, they can close the net around us and we won't be able to punch our way out. But if we attack from two fronts at once...\"</p><p>She quickly outlined her plan. It made sense to Vancha and me, so we held back while she made several phone calls. Then we waited an impatient hour, taking it easy, preparing ourselves mentally and physically. As we watched, the smoke thickened from the fires inside the stadium, and the crowd around the barriers grew. Many of the newcomers were tramps and homeless people. They mixed with the others and slowly pushed forwards, where they waited close to the barriers, quiet, unnoticed.</p>","<p>When all was as it should be, Alice handed me a pistol and we bade her farewell. The three of us joined hands and wished each other luck. Then Vancha and I set our sights on the unguarded door. With Evanna following us like a ghost, we boldly walked past the ranks of armed police. They averted their eyes or turned their backs on us as we passed. Moments later we left the brightness outside for the darkness of the stadium tunnels and our date with destiny.</p><p>We had entered the leopards den.</p><p>Chapter SEVEN</p><p>The tunnel twisted a lot, but ran directly under the stands to the open interior of the stadium. Vancha and I walked side by side in absolute silence. If Steve was waiting, and the night went against us, one of us would die within the next few hours. There wasn't much to say in a situation like that. Vancha was probably making his peace with the vampire gods. I was worrying about what would happen after the fight, fixed on the idea that there must be some way to stop the coming of the Lord of the Shadows.</p><p>There were no traps along the way and we saw nobody. When we left the confines of the tunnel, we stood by the exit for a minute, numbly absorbing the chaos which Steve's troops had created. Evanna moved away slightly to our left, and she studied the carnage too.</p><p>The big top of the Cirque Du Freak, along with most of the vans and tents, had been set ablaze - the source of the banks of smoke which clogged the air overhead. The performers and circus crew had been herded together about twenty metres ahead of the tunnel, clear of the stands. Harkat stood among them, near Evra and Merla. I'd never seen his grey face filled with such rage. They were surrounded by eight armed vampets, and spotlights which had been taken from inside the big top were trained upon them. Several dead bodies lay nearby. Most were backstage crew, but one was a long-serving star of the show - the skinny, supple, musical Alexander Ribs would never take to the stage again.</p><p>Ripping the piece of cloth away from my eyes, I let my sight adjust, then looked for Debbie among the survivors - there was no sign of her. In a panic, I examined the faces and forms of the corpses again, for fear she was lying among them - but I couldn't see her.</p><p>Several vampaneze and vampets patrolled the stadium, circling the burning tents and vans, controlling the flames. As I watched, Mr Tiny strolled out of the burning pyre of the big top, through a wall of fire, rubbing his hands together. He was wearing a red top hat and gloves - Mr Tall's. I understood instinctively that he'd left Mr Tall's body inside the tent, using it as a makeshift funeral pyre. Mr Tiny didn't look upset, but I could tell by his donning of the hat and gloves that, on some level, he'd been in some way affected by his son's death.</p><p>Between the burning tent and the surviving members of the Cirque Du Freak stood a new addition - a hastily constructed gallows. Several nooses hung from the crossbeam, but only one was filled - with the poor, thin neck of the snake-boy, Shancus Von.</p><p>I cried aloud when I spotted Shancus and made to rush towards him. Vancha gripped my left wrist and jerked me back. \"We can't help him now,\" he growled.</p><p>\"But-\" I started to argue.</p><p>\"Lower your gaze,\" he said quietly.</p><p>When I did, I saw that a band of vampaneze was grouped beneath the crossbeam and knotted ropes. All were armed with swords or battle-axes. Behind them, standing on something that raised him above them, and smirking evilly, stood their master, the Lord of the Vampaneze - Steve Leopard. He hadn't seen us yet.</p><p>\"Easy,\" Vancha said as I stiffened. \"No need to rush.\" His eyes were sliding slowly left and right. \"How many vampaneze and vampets are here? Are there more hiding in the stands or behind the burning vans and tents? Let's work out exactly what we have to deal with before we go barging ahead.\"</p><p>Breathing deeply, I forced myself to think calmly, then studied the lie of the land. I counted fourteen vampaneze - nine grouped around Steve - and more than thirty vampets. I didn't see Gannen Harst, but guessed he would be close by Steve, hidden by the group of circus folk between us and the gallows.</p><p>\"I make it a dozen-plus vampaneze and three times that amount of vampets, aye?\" Vancha said.</p><p>\"More or less,\" I agreed.</p><p>Vancha looked sideways at me and winked. \"The odds are in our favour, Sire.\"</p><p>\"You think so?\"</p><p>\"Most definitely,\" he said with fake enthusiasm - we both knew it didn't look good. We were vastly outnumbered by enemies with superior weapons. Our only ace card was that the vampaneze and vampets couldn't kill us. Mr Tiny had predicted doom for them if anybody other than their Lord murdered the hunters.</p><p>Without saying anything, we started forward at the exact same moment. I was carrying two knives, one in either hand. Vancha had drawn a couple of throwing stars but was otherwise unarmed - he believed in fighting with his bare hands at close quarters. Evanna moved when we did, shadowing our every footstep.</p><p>The vampets surrounding the imprisoned Cirque Du Freak troupe saw us coming but didn't react, except to close a little more tightly around the people they were guarding. They didn't even warn the others that we were here. Then I saw that they didn't need to - Steve and his cronies had already spotted us. Steve was standing on a box, or something, staring happily at us, while the vampaneze in front of him bunched defensively, weapons at the ready.</p><p>We had to pass the circus prisoners to get to Steve. I stopped as we drew level with Evra, Merla and Harkat. Evra and Merla's eyes were wet with tears. Harkat's green globes were shining with fury, and he'd pulled down his mask to bare his sharp grey teeth (he could survive up to half a day without the mask).</p><p>I gazed sorrowfully at Evra and Merla, then at the body of their son, dangling from the gallows further ahead. The vampets guarding my friends watched me cautiously but made no move against me.</p><p>\"Come on,\" Vancha said, tugging at my elbow.</p><p>\"I'm sorry,\" I croaked to Evra and Merla, unable to continue without saying something. \"I wouldn't... I didn't... if I could...\" I stopped, unable to think of anything else to say.</p><p>Evra and Merla said nothing for a moment. Then, with a screech, Merla smashed through the guards around her and threw herself at me. \"I hate you.'\" she screamed, scratching my face, spitting with rage. \"My son's dead because of you!\"</p><p>I couldn't react. I felt sick with shame. Merla dragged me to the ground, yelling and crying, beating me with her fists. The vampets moved forward to pull her off, but Steve shouted, \"No! Leave them alone! This is fun!\"</p>","<p>We rolled away from the vampets, Merla driving me back. I didn't even raise my hands to defend myself as she called me every name under the moon. I just wanted the earth to open and swallow me whole.</p><p>And then, as Merla lowered her face as though to bite me, she whispered in my ear, \"Steve has Debbie.\" I gawped at her. She roared more insults, then whispered again, \"We didn't fight. They think we're gutless, but we were waiting for you . Harkat said you'd come and lead us.\"</p><p>Merla cuffed me about the head, then locked gazes with me. \"It wasn't your fault,\" she said, smiling ever so slightly through her tears. \"We don't hate you. Steve's the evil one - not you.\"</p><p>\"But... if I hadn't... if I'd told Vancha to kill R.V...\"</p><p>\"Don't think that way,\" she snarled. \"You're not to blame. Now help us kill the savages who are ! Give us a signal when you're ready and we'll answer the call. We'll fight to the death, every last one of us.\"</p><p>She screamed at me again, grabbed me by the neck to strangle me, then fell off and punched the ground, sobbing pitifully. Evra pushed forward, collected his wife and led her back to the pack. He glanced at me once, fleetingly, and I saw the same thing in his expression that I'd seen in Merla's - sorrow for the loss of their son, hatred for Steve and his gang, but only pity for me.</p><p>I still felt at fault for what had happened to Shancus and the others. But Evra and Merla's sympathy gave me the strength to carry on. If they'd hated me, I doubt I could have continued. But now that they'd given me their backing, I not only felt able to push on - I felt that I had to. For their sakes, if not my own.</p><p>I got to my feet, acting shaken. As Vancha came to help me, I spoke quickly and quietly. \"They're with us. They'll fight when we do.\"</p><p>He paused, then carried forward as though I hadn't spoken, checking my face where Merla had scratched me, loudly asking if she'd harmed me, if I was OK, if I wanted to rest a while.</p><p>\"I'm fine,\" I grunted, pushing past him, showing my circus friends a stiff back, as if they'd insulted me. \"Merla said Steve has Debbie,\" I hissed to Vancha out of the side of my mouth, barely moving my lips.</p><p>\"We might not be able to save her,\" he whispered back.</p><p>\"I know,\" I said stonily. \"But we'll try?\"</p><p>A short pause. Then, \"Aye,\" he replied.</p><p>With that, we quickened our pace and made a beeline for the gallows and the grinning, demonic, half-vampaneze beast waiting underneath, face half hidden by the shadow of the dangling Shancus Von.</p><p>Chapter EIGHT</p><p>\"Halt!\" one of the nine vampaneze in front of Steve shouted when we were about five metres away. We stopped. This close, I saw that Steve was actually standing on the body of one of the circus crew - Pasta O'Malley, a man who used to sleepwalk and even sleep-read. I could also see Gannen Harst now, just to Steve's right, sword undrawn, watching us intently.</p><p>\"Drop your throwing stars,\" the vampaneze said to Vancha. When he didn't respond, two of the vampaneze raised spears and pointed them at him. With a shrug, Vancha slid the shurikens back into their holders and lowered his hands.</p><p>I glanced up at Shancus, swinging in the light breeze. The crossbeam creaked. The sound was louder than normal for me because of the purge - like the squeal of a wild boar.</p><p>\"Get him down,\" I snarled at Steve.</p><p>\"I don't think so,\" Steve replied lightly. \"I like the sight of him up there. Maybe I'll hang his parents beside him. His brother and sister too. Keep the whole family together. What do you think?\"</p><p>\"Why do you go along with this madman?\" Vancha asked Gannen Harst. \"I don't care what Des Tiny says about him - this lunatic can bring nothing but shame upon the vampaneze. You should have killed him years ago.\"</p><p>\"He is of our blood,\" Gannen Harst replied quietly. \"I don't agree with his ways - he knows that - but we don't kill our kin.\"</p><p>\"You do if they break your laws,\" Vancha grunted. \"Leonard lies and uses guns. Any normal vampaneze would be executed if they did that.\"</p><p>\"But he isn't normal,\" Gannen said. \"He is our Lord. Desmond Tiny said we would perish if we did not follow him and obey. Whether I like it or not, Steve has the power to bend our laws, or even ignore them completely. I'd rather he didn't, but it's not my place to chastise him when he does.\"</p><p>\"You can't approve of his actions,\" Vancha pushed.</p><p>\"No,\" Gannen admitted. \"But he has been accepted by the clan, and I am only a servant of my people. History can judge Steve. I'm content to serve and protect, in line with the wishes of those who appointed me.\"</p><p>Vancha glared at his brother, trying to stare him down, but Gannen only gazed back blankly. Then Steve laughed. \"Aren't family get-togethers a joy?\" he said. \"I was hoping you'd bring Annie and Darius along. Imagine the fun all six of us could have had!\"</p><p>\"They're far away from here by now,\" I said. I wanted to dive for him and rip his throat open with my bare hands and teeth, but his guards would have cut me down before I struck. I had to be patient and pray for a chance to present itself. \"How's my son?\" Steve asked. \"Did you kill him?\"</p><p>\"Of course not,\" I snorted. \"I didn't have to. When he saw you murder Shancus he realized you were a monster. I filled him in on your past glories . Annie told him some old stories too. He'll never listen to you again. You've lost him. He's your son no more.\"</p><p>I hoped to wound Steve with my words but he just laughed them off. \"Oh well, I was never that fond of him anyway. A scrawny, moody kid. No taste for blood. Although,\" he chuckled, \"I guess he'll develop one soon!\"</p><p>\"I wouldn't be too sure of that,\" I retorted.</p><p>\"I blooded him,\" Steve boasted. \"He's half-vampaneze.\"</p><p>\"No,\" I smiled. \"He's a half-vampire. Like me.\"</p><p>Steve stared at me uncertainly. \"You re-blooded him?\"</p><p>\"Yes. He's one of us now. He won't need to kill when he feeds. Like I said, he's no longer your son - in any way whatsoever.\"</p><p>Steve's features darkened. \"You shouldn't have done that,\" he growled. \"The boy was mine.\"</p><p>\"He was never yours, not in spirit,\" I said. \"You merely tricked him into believing he was.\"</p>","<p>Steve started to reply, then scowled and shook his head gruffly. \"Never mind,\" he muttered. \"The child's not important. I'll deal with him - and his mother - later. Let's get down to the good stuff. We all know the prophecy.\" He nodded at Mr Tiny, who was wandering around the burning tents and vans, paying no apparent interest to us. \"Darren or Vancha will kill me, or I'll kill one of you, and that will decide the fate of the War of the Scars.\"</p><p>\"If Tiny's right, or telling the truth, aye,\" Vancha sniffed.</p><p>\"You don't believe him?\" Steve frowned.</p><p>\"Not entirely,\" Vancha said. \"Tiny and his daughter-\" He glared at Evanna -\"have agendas of their own. I accept most of what they predict but I don't treat their predictions as absolute facts.\"</p><p>\"Then why are you here?\" Steve challenged him.</p><p>\"In case they are correct.\"</p><p>Steve looked confused. \"How can you not believe them? Desmond Tiny is the voice of destiny. He sees the future. He knows all that has been and will be.\"</p><p>\"We make our own futures,\" Vancha said. \"Regardless of what happens tonight, I believe my people will defeat yours. But I'll kill you anyway,\" he added with a wicked grin. \"Just to be on the safe side.\"</p><p>\"You're an ignorant fool,\" Steve said, shaking with outrage. Then his gaze settled on me. \"I bet you believe the prophecy.\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\" I replied.</p><p>\"Of course you do,\" Steve smiled. \"And you know it's you or me, don't you? Vancha's a red herring. You and I are the sons of destiny, the ruler and slave, the victor and vanquished. Leave Vancha behind, step up here alone, and I swear it will be a fair fight. You and me, man to man, one winner, one loser. A Vampaneze Lord to rule the night - or a Vampire Prince.\"</p><p>\"How can I trust you?\" I asked. \"You're a liar. You'll spring a trap.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Steve barked. \"You have my word.\"</p><p>\"Like that means anything,\" I jeered, but I could see an eagerness in Steve's expression. His offer was genuine. I glanced sideways at Vancha. \"What do you think?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Vancha said. \"We're in this together. We'll take him on as a team.\"</p><p>\"But if he's prepared to fight me fairly...\"</p><p>\"That demon knows nothing about fairness,\" Vancha said. \"He'd cheat - that's his nature. We'll do nothing the way he wants.\"</p><p>\"Very well.\" I faced Steve again. \"Stuff your offer. What next?\"</p><p>I thought Steve was going to leap over the ranks of vampaneze and attack me. He gnashed his teeth, hands twisted together, shivering furiously. Gannen Harst saw it too, but to my surprise, rather than step in to calm Steve down, he took a half-step back. It was as if he wanted Steve to leap, like he'd had enough of his insane, evil Lord, and wanted this matter settled, one way or the other.</p><p>But just when it seemed as if the moment of final confrontation had come, Steve relaxed and his smile returned. \"I do my best,\" he sighed. \"I try to make it easy for everybody, but some people are determined not to play ball. Very well. Here's 'what next'.\"</p><p>Steve put his fingers to his lips and whistled sharply. From behind the gallows, R.V. stepped out. The bearded, ex-eco-warrior was holding a rope between three lonely-looking hooks (Mr Tall had snapped the other hooks off before he died). When he tugged on the rope, a bound woman shuffled out after him - Debbie.</p><p>I'd been expecting this, so I didn't panic. R.V. walked Debbie forwards a few paces, but stopped a long way short of Steve. The one-time campaigner for peace and the protection of mother nature didn't look very happy. He was twitchy, head jerking, eyes unfocused, nervously chewing at his lower lip, which was bleeding from where he'd bitten through the flesh. R.V. had been a proud, earnest, dedicated man when I first met him, fighting to save the world from pollution. Then he'd become a mad beast, intent only on gaining revenge for the loss of his hands. Now he was neither - just a ragged, sorry mess.</p><p>Steve didn't notice R.V.'s confusion. He had eyes only for Debbie. \"Isn't she beautiful?\" he mocked me. \"Like an angel. More warrior-like than the last time we met, but all the lovelier because of it.\" He looked at me slyly. \"Be a shame if I had to tell R.V. to gut her like a rabid dog.\"</p><p>\"You can't use her against me,\" I said softly, gazing at Steve without blinking. \"She knows who you are and what's at stake. I love her, but my first duty is to my clan. She understands that.\"</p><p>\"You mean you'll stand there and let her die?\" Steve shrieked.</p><p>\"Yes!\" Debbie shouted before I could reply.</p><p>\"You people,\" Steve groaned. \"You're determined to annoy me. I try to be fair, but you toss it back in my face and...\" He hopped off of Pasta O'Malley's back and ranted and raved, striding up and down behind his guards. I kept a close watch on him. If he stepped out too far, I'd strike. But even in his rage he was careful not to expose himself.</p><p>All of a sudden Steve stopped. \"So be it!\" he snarled. \"R.V. - kill her!\"</p><p>R.V. didn't respond. He was gazing miserably down at the ground.</p><p>\"R.V.!\" Steve shouted. \"Didn't you hear me? Kill her!\"</p><p>\"Don't want to,\" R.V. mumbled. His eyes came up and I saw pain and doubt in them. \"You shouldn't have killed the kid, Steve. He did nothing to hurt us. It was wrong. Kids are the future, man.\"</p><p>\"I did what I had to,\" Steve replied tightly. \"Now you'll do the same.\"</p><p>\"But she's not a vampire...\"</p><p>\"She works for them!\" Steve shouted.</p><p>\"I know,\" R.V. moaned. \"But why do we have to kill her? Why did you kill the kid? It was Darren we were meant to kill. He's the enemy, man. He's the one who cost me my hands.\"</p><p>\"Don't betray me now,\" Steve growled, stepping towards the bearded vampaneze. \"You've killed people too, the innocent as well as the guilty. Don't get moralistic on me. It doesn't become you.\"</p><p>\"But...but... but...\"</p><p>\"Stop stuttering and kill her!\" Steve screamed. He took another step forward and moved clear of his guards without being aware of it. I steeled myself to make a dash at him, but Vancha was one move ahead of me.</p><p>\"Now !\" Vancha roared, leaping forward, drawing a shuriken and launching it at Steve. He would have killed him, except the guard at the end of the line saw the danger just in time and threw himself into the path of the deadly throwing star, sacrificing himself to save his Lord.</p>","<p>As the other guards surged sideways to block Vancha's path to their Lord, I sheathed my knives, drew the pistol I'd borrowed from Alice before entering the stadium, aimed it at the sky and pulled the trigger three times - the signal for all-out riot!</p><p>Chapter NINE</p><p>Even before the echoes of the report of my third shot faded, the air outside the stadium filled with answering gunfire, as Alice and her band of vampirites opened fire on the police standing guard. She'd summoned the homeless people before Vancha and I entered the tunnel, and positioned them around the barrier outside the stadium. After years of surviving on the scraps other people threw away, this was their time to rise. They had only a small amount of training and basic weapons, but they had passion and anger on their side, and the desire to prove themselves. So now, at my signal, they leapt the barriers around the stadium and attacked as a unified force, throwing themselves upon the startled police, sacrificing themselves where necessary, fighting and dying not just for their own lives, but for the lives of those who considered them trash.</p><p>We weren't sure of the intentions of the police. Steve might have told them to remain outside regardless of what happened within, in which case the attack by the vampirites would serve no purpose at all. But if they were there to support the vampaneze and vampets, to come to their aid if summoned, the vampirites could divert them and buy those of us inside the stadium a bit more space and time.</p><p>Most of the vampaneze guarding Steve moved to stop Vancha when he charged, but two lunged at me as I fired the pistol. They tackled me to the ground, knocking the gun from my hand. I struck out at them but they simply lay on top of me, pinning me down. They would have held me there, helpless, while their colleagues dealt with Vancha. Except...</p><p>The stars and crew of the Cirque Du Freak had also rallied to my signal. At the same time that the vampirites attacked the police, the prisoners inside the stadium turned on the vampets holding them captive. They attacked with their bare hands, driving the vampets back by sheer force of numbers. The vampets fired into the crowd and hacked wildly with their swords and axes. Several people fell, dead or wounded. But the group pushed on regardless, screaming, punching, kicking, biting - no force on Earth could hold them back.</p><p>While the bulk of the Cirque Du Freak troupe grappled with the vampets, Harkat led a small band towards the gallows. He'd grabbed an axe from a dead vampet and with one smooth swing he cut down a vampaneze who tried to intercept them, rushing past without breaking his stride.</p><p>Vancha was still locked in a struggle with Steve's guards, doing his best to break through to their Lord. He'd downed two of them but the others were standing firm. He was cut in many places, knife and spear wounds, but none fatal. Looking around, I saw Gannen Harst push Steve away from the threat. Steve was arguing with him - he wanted to take Vancha on.</p><p>Behind Steve and Gannen Harst, R.V. had let go of Debbie's rope and was backing away from her, shaking his head, hooks crossed behind his back, wanting no part of this. Debbie was tugging at her bonds, trying to wriggle free.</p><p>The two vampaneze holding me down saw Harkat and the others racing towards them. Cursing, they abandoned me and lashed out at their attackers. They were too swift for the ordinary circus folk - three died quickly - but Truska was part of the group, and she wasn't so easily despatched. She'd let her beard grow while she'd been waiting to fight - the unnatural blonde hair now trailed down past her feet. Standing back, she made the beard rise - she could control the hairs as though they were snakes - then directed the twisting strands towards one of the vampaneze. The beard parted into two prongs, then curled around the startled vampaneze's throat and tightened. He sliced at the hair and at Truska, but she had him too firmly in her grip. He fell to his knees, purple features darkening even further as he choked.</p><p>Harkat took on the other vampaneze, chopping at him with his axe. The Little Person lacked the speed of a vampaneze, but he was very powerful and his round green eyes were alert to his opponent's swift moves. He could fight as an equal, as he had many times in the past.</p><p>I circled around the vampaneze struggling with Vancha. I meant to go after Steve, but he and Gannen had linked up with three of the vampaneze who'd been roaming the grounds of the stadium. I didn't fancy the five-to-one odds, so I went to cut Debbie free instead.</p><p>\"They surrounded the stadium shortly after Harkat and I arrived,\" she cried as I sliced through the ropes binding her arms. \"I tried phoning, but it wouldn't work. It was Mr Tiny. He blocked my signal. I saw his watch glowing, and he was laughing.\"</p><p>\"It's OK,\" I said. \"We'd have come anyway. We had to.\"</p><p>\"Is that Alice outside?\" Debbie asked - the gunfire was deafening now.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said. \"The vampirites seem to be enjoying their first taste of action.\"</p><p>Vancha lurched over to us, streaming blood. The vampaneze had given up on him and retreated, teaming up with the vampets and picking fights with the circus folk. \"Where's Leonard?\" Vancha bellowed.</p><p>I peered around the stadium but it was almost impossible to pick out any individuals in the press of bodies. \"I had him in my sights a minute ago,\" I said. \"He must be here somewhere.\"</p><p>\"Not if Gannen flitted with him!\" Vancha roared. He wiped blood clear of his eyes and looked for Steve and Gannen again.</p><p>\"Are you badly wounded?\" Debbie asked him.</p><p>\"Scratches!\" Vancha grunted. Then he shouted, \"There.' Behind the fat man!\"</p><p>He rushed forward, bellowing madly. Squinting, I caught a glimpse of Steve. He was close to the enormous Rhamus Twobellies, warily backing away from him. Rhamus was literally falling on his opponents, squashing them lifeless.</p><p>Debbie darted away from me, picked the bodies of the dead vampaneze clean of their weapons, and returned with an array of knives and two swords. She gave one of the swords to me and hefted the other herself. It was too large for her, but she held it steady, face set. \"You go get Steve,\" she said. \"I'll help the others.\"</p><p>\"Be-\" I began, but she'd already raced out of earshot, \"-careful,\" I finished softly. I shook my head, smiled briefly, then set off after Steve.</p><p>Around me the battle was raging. The circus folk were locked in bloody combat with the vampets and vampaneze, fighting clumsily but effectively, blind fury compensating for lack of military training. The gifted freaks were a huge help. Truska was causing havoc with her beard. Rhamus was an immovable foe. Gertha Teeth was biting off fingers, noses, sword tips. Hans Hands had tucked his legs behind his neck and was dodging between the enemy forces on his hands, too low for them to easily strike, tripping them up and dividing them.</p>","<p>Vancha had come to a halt, held up by the fighting. He started firing shurikens at those enemies ahead of him, to clear a path. Jekkus Flang stepped up beside him and added his throwing knives to Vancha's stars. A deadly, efficient combination. I couldn't help thinking what a great show they could have put on if we'd been playing to an audience tonight instead of fighting for our lives.</p><p>Mr Tiny was picking his way through the mass of warring bodies, beaming merrily, admiring the corpses of the dead, studying the dying with polite interest, applauding those locked in especially vicious duels. Evanna was edging towards her father, disinterested in the carnage, bare feet and lower ropes stained with blood.</p><p>Gannen and Steve were still backing away from the massive Rhamus Twobellies, using him as a shield - it was hard for anybody else to get at them with Rhamus in the way. I tracked them like a hound, closing in. I was almost at the mouth of the tunnel through which we'd entered the stadium when fresh bodies burst through it. My insides tightened - I thought the police had come to the aid of their companions, meaning almost certain defeat for us. But then, to my astonished delight, I realized it was Alice Burgess and a dozen or so vampirites. Declan and Little Kenny - the pair who'd rescued me from the street when Darius shot me - were among them.</p><p>\"Still alive?\" Alice shouted as her troops laid into the vampaneze and vampets, faces twisted with excitement and battle lust.</p><p>\"How'd you get in?\" I yelled in reply. The plan had been for her to cause a diversion outside the stadium, to hold up the police - not invade with a force of her own.</p><p>\"We attacked at the front, as planned,\" she said. \"The police rushed to that point, to battle en masse - they lack discipline. Most of my troops fled with the crowd after a few minutes - you should have seen the chaos! - but I slipped around the back with a few volunteers. The entrance to the tunnel is completely unguarded now. We-\"</p><p>A vampet attacked her and she had to wheel aside to deal with him. I did a very quick head count. With the addition of the vampirites, we seriously outnumbered the vampaneze and vampets. Although the fighting was brutal and disorganized, we had the upper hand. Unless the police outside recovered swiftly and rushed in, we'd win this battle! But that would mean nothing if Steve escaped, so I put all thoughts of victory on hold and went in pursuit of him again.</p><p>I didn't get very far. R.V. had backed away from the fighting. He was heading for the tunnel, but I was standing almost directly in his path. When he saw me, he stopped. I wasn't sure what to do - fight or let him escape so that I could go after Steve? While I was making up my mind, Cormac Limbs stepped in between us.</p><p>\"Come on, hairy!\" he roared at R.V., slapping his face with his left hand, jabbing at him with a knife held in his right. \"Let's be having you!\"</p><p>\"No!\" R.V. moaned. \"I don't want to fight.\"</p><p>\"The devil you don't, you big, bearded, bug-eyed baboon!\" Cormac shouted, slapping R.V. again. This time R.V. lashed out at Cormac's hand with his hooks. He cut two of the fingers off, but they immediately grew back. \"You'll have to do better than that, stink-breath!\" Cormac taunted him.</p><p>\"Then I will!\" R.V. shouted, losing his cool. Jumping forwards, he knocked Cormac over, knelt on his chest, and before I could do anything, he struck at Cormac's neck with his hooks. He didn't cut it clean off, but sliced about halfway through. Then, with a grunt, he hacked through the rest of it, and tossed Cormac's head aside like a ball.</p><p>\"You shouldn't have messed with me, man!\" R.V. groaned, rising shakily. I was about to attack him, to avenge Cormac's death, but then I saw that he was sobbing. \"I didn't want to kill you!\" R.V. howled. \"I didn't want to kill anybody! I wanted to help people. I wanted to save the world. I...\"</p><p>He ground to a halt, eyes widening with disbelief. Glancing down, I also came to a stunned stop. Where Cormac's head had been, two new heads were growing, shooting out on a pair of thin necks. They were slightly smaller than his old head, but otherwise identical. When they stopped growing, there was a short pause. Then Cormac's eyes fluttered open and he spat blood out of both mouths. His eyes came into focus. He looked at R.V. with one set and at me with the other. Then his heads turned and he stared at himself.</p><p>\"So that's what happens when I cut my head off!\" he exclaimed through both mouths at the same time. \"I always wondered about that!\"</p><p>\"Madness!\" R.V. screamed. \"The world's gone mad! Mad !\"</p><p>Spinning crazily, he rushed past Cormac, then past me, gibbering insanely, drooling and falling over. I could have killed him easily - but I chose not to. Standing aside, I let the wretch pass, and watched sadly as he staggered down the tunnel, out of sight. R.V. had never been right in the head since losing his hands, and now he'd lost his senses completely. I couldn't bring myself to punish this pathetic shadow of a man.</p><p>And now, at last - Steve. He and Gannen were part of a small band of vampaneze and vampets. They'd been forced towards the centre of the stadium by the freaks, circus helpers and vampirites. Lots of smaller fights were still being waged around the stadium, but this was their last big stand. If this unit fell, they were all doomed.</p><p>Vancha was closing in on the group. I joined him. There was no sign of Jekkus Flang - I didn't know whether he'd fallen to the enemy or run out of knives, and this wasn't the time to make enquiries. Vancha paused when he saw me. \"Ready?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Ready,\" I said.</p><p>\"I don't care which of us kills him,\" Vancha said, \"but let me go first. If-\" He stopped, face twisting with fear. \"No!\" he roared.</p><p>Following the direction of his eyes, I saw that Steve had tripped. Evra stood over him, a long knife held in both hands, determined to take the life of the man who'd killed his son. If he struck, the Lord of the Vampaneze would die by the hand of one who wasn't destined to kill him. If Mr Tiny's prophecy was true, that would have dire results for the vampire clan.</p><p>As we watched, unable to prevent it, Evra stopped abruptly. He shook his head, blinked dumbly - then stepped over Steve and left him lying on the ground, unharmed. Steve sat up, bleary-eyed, not sure what had happened. Gannen Harst stooped and helped him to his feet. The two men stood, alone in the crush, totally ignored by everyone around them.</p><p>\"Over there,\" I whispered, touching Vancha's shoulder. Far off to our right, Mr Tiny stood, eyes on Steve and Gannen. He was holding his heart-shaped watch in his right hand. It was glowing redly. Evanna was standing beside him, her face illuminated by the glow of her father's watch.</p>","<p>I don't know if Steve and Gannen saw Mr Tiny and realized that he was protecting them. But they were alert enough to seize their chance and run for the freedom of the tunnel.</p><p>Mr Tiny watched the pair race free of danger. Then he looked at Vancha and me, and smiled. The glow of his watch faded and his lips moved softly. Even though we were a long way off, we heard him clearly, as if he was standing next to us. \"It's time, boys!\"</p><p>\"Harkat!\" I shouted, wanting him to come with us, to be there at the end, as he'd been by my side for so much of the hunt. But he didn't hear me. Nobody did. I glanced around the stadium at Harkat, Alice, Evra, Debbie. All of my friends were locked in battle with the vampaneze and vampets. None of them knew what was happening with Steve and Gannen Harst. They weren't part of this. It was just me and Vancha now.</p><p>\"To the death, Sire?\" Vancha murmured.</p><p>\"To the death,\" I agreed miserably. I ran my eyes over the faces of my friends for what might be the final time, bidding silent farewells to the scaly Evra Von, the grey-skinned Harkat Mulds, the steely Alice Burgess and my beloved Debbie Hemlock, more beautiful than ever as she tore into her foes like an Amazonian warrior of old. Perhaps it was for the best that I couldn't bid them a proper farewell. There was so much to say, I don't know where I would have begun.</p><p>Then Vancha and I jogged after Steve and Gannen Harst, not rushing, sure that they wouldn't flit, not this time, not until we'd satisfied the terms of Mr Tiny's prophecy and Steve or one of us lay dead. Behind us, Mr Tiny and Evanna followed like ghosts. They alone would bear witness to the final battle, the death of one of the hunters or Steve - and the birth of the Lord of the Shadows, destroyer of the present and all-ruling monster of the future.</p><p>Chapter TEN</p><p>We followed Steve and Gannen down the hill at the rear of the stadium. They were fleeing towards the river, but they weren't racing at top speed. Either one of them was injured or, like ourselves, they'd simply accepted the fact that we had to fight, an evenly matched contest, to the bitter, bloody end.</p><p>As we jogged down the hill, leaving the stadium, lights and noises behind, my headache lessened. I would have been glad of that, except now that I was able to focus, I realized how physically drained I was. I'd been operating on reserve energy for a long time and had just about run dry. Even the simplest movement was a huge chore. All I could do was carry on as long as possible and hope I got an adrenaline burst when we caught up with our prey.</p><p>As we reached level ground at the bottom of the hill, I stumbled and almost fell. Luckily Vancha had been keeping an eye on me. He caught and steadied me. \"Feel bad?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Awful,\" I groaned.</p><p>\"Maybe you're not meant to go any further,\" he said. \"Perhaps you should rest here and-\"</p><p>\"Save your breath,\" I stopped him. \"I'm going on, even if I have to crawl.\"</p><p>Vancha laughed, then tilted my head back and examined my face, his small eyes unusually dark. \"You'll make a fine vampire,\" he said. \"I hope I'm around to celebrate your coming of age.\"</p><p>\"You're not getting defeatist on me, are you?\" I grunted.</p><p>\"No.\" He smiled weakly. \"We'll win. Of course we will. I just...\"</p><p>He stopped, slapped my back and urged me on. Wearily, every step an effort, I threw myself after Steve and Gannen Harst again. I did my best to match Vancha's pace, swinging my legs as evenly as I could, keeping the rest of my body limp, relaxed, saving energy.</p><p>Steve and Gannen reached the river and turned right, jogging along the bank. As they came to the arch of a bridge spanning the river, they stopped. It looked like they were having an argument. Gannen was trying to pick Steve up - I assumed he meant to flit, with Steve on his back, as they'd escaped from us once before. Steve was having none of it. He slapped his protector's hands away, gesturing furiously. Then, as we closed upon them, Gannen's shoulders sagged and he nodded wearily. The pair turned away from the pass beneath the bridge, drew their weapons and stood waiting for us.</p><p>We slowed and walked the rest of the way. I could hear Mr Tiny and Evanna close behind - they'd caught up to us within the last few seconds - but I didn't turn to look back.</p><p>\"You could use your shurikens,\" I whispered to Vancha as we came within range of Steve and Gannen Harst.</p><p>\"That would be dishonourable,\" Vancha replied. \"They've faced us openly, in expectation of a fair fight. We must confront them.\"</p><p>He was right. Killing mercilessly wasn't the vampire way. But I half wished he'd put his principles aside, for once, and fire his throwing stars at them until they dropped. It would be much simpler and surer that way.</p><p>We drew to a halt a couple of metres short of Steve and Gannen. Steve's eyes were alight with excitement and a slight shade of fear - he knew there were no guarantees now, no more opportunities for dirty tricks or games. It was a plain, fair fight to the death, and that was something he couldn't control.</p><p>\"Greetings, brother,\" Gannen Harst said, bowing his head.</p><p>\"Greetings,\" Vancha replied stiffly. \"I'm glad you face us like true creatures of the night at last. Perhaps in death you can find again the honour which you abandoned during life.\"</p><p>\"Honour will be shared by all here tonight,\" Gannen said, \"both the living and the dead.\"</p><p>\"They don't half go on a lot,\" Steve sighed. He squared up to me. \"Ready to die, Shan?\"</p><p>I stepped forward. \"If that's what fate has in store for me - yes,\" I answered. \"But I'm also ready to kill.\" With that I raised my sword and struck the first blow of the fight which would decide the outcome of the War of the Scars.</p><p>Steve stood his ground, brought his own sword up - it was shorter and easier to handle than mine - and turned my blow aside. Gannen Harst stabbed at me with his long, straight sword. Vancha slapped the blade wide of its target and pulled me out of immediate range of his brother.</p><p>Vancha only gave me a relatively gentle tug, but in my weakened state I staggered backwards and wound up in an untidy mess on the ground, close to Mr Tiny and Evanna. By the time I struggled to my feet, Vancha was locked in combat with Steve and Gannen Harst, hands a blur as he defended himself against their swords with his bare palms.</p><p>\"He's a fierce creature, isn't he?\" Mr Tiny remarked to his daughter. \"Quite the beast of nature. I like him.\"</p>","<p>Evanna didn't reply. All her senses were focused on the battle, and there was worry and uncertainty in her eyes . I knew in that moment that she'd told the truth and really didn't know which way this would go.</p><p>I turned away from the onlookers and caught quick flashes of the fight which was unfolding at superhuman speed. Steve nicked Vancha's left arm near the top - Vancha kicked him in the chest in return. Gannen's sword scraped down Vancha's left side, slicing a thin gouge from breast to waist - Vancha replied by grabbing his brother's sword hand and wrenching it back, snapping the bones of his wrist. Gannen gasped with pain as he dropped the sword, then ducked for it and grabbed it with his left hand. As he came to his feet again, Vancha struck his head with his right knee. Gannen fell away with a heavy grunt.</p><p>Vancha spun round to deal with Steve, but Steve was already upon him, making short sweeps with his sword, keeping Vancha at bay. Vancha tried to grab the sword, but only succeeded in having the flesh of his palms cut open. I staggered up beside him. I wasn't of much use right then - I could barely raise my sword, and my legs dragged like dead weights - but at least it provided Steve with a double threat. If I could distract him, Vancha might be able to penetrate his defences and strike.</p><p>As I drew level with Vancha, panting and sweating, Gannen swung back into battle, dazed but determined, chopping angrily at Vancha, forcing him to retreat. I stabbed at Gannen, but Steve diverted my sword with his, then let go of the handle with one hand and punched me between the eyes. I dropped back, startled, and Steve drove the tip of his sword at my face.</p><p>If he'd had both hands on the sword, he'd have thrust it through me. But one-handed, he wasn't able to direct it as powerfully as he wished. I managed to knock it aside with my left arm. A deep cut opened up just below my elbow and I felt all the strength leave the fingers of that hand.</p><p>Steve stabbed at me again. I raised my sword to protect myself. Too late I realized he'd only feinted. Wheeling around, he threw himself into me, right shoulder first. He struck me heavily in the chest and I fell back, winded losing hold of my sword. There was a yell behind me and I crashed into Vancha. Both of us went down, Vancha taken by surprise, arms and legs entangled with mine.</p><p>It took Vancha no more than a second to free himself - but that second was all Gannen Harst required. Darting forward, almost too fast for me to see, he stuck the tip of his sword into the small of Vancha's back - then shoved it all the way through and out the front of Vancha's stomach!</p><p>Vancha's eyes and mouth shot wide open. Gannen stood behind him a moment. Then he stepped away and pulled his sword free. Blood gushed out of Vancha, both in front and behind, and he collapsed in agony, face twisted, limbs thrashing.</p><p>\"May your gods forgive me, brother,\" Gannen whispered, his face haggard, eyes haunted. \"Though I fear I'll never forgive myself.\"</p><p>I scrabbled away from the downed Prince, chasing my sword. Steve stood close by, laughing. With an effort, Gannen regained control and set about securing victory. Hurrying over to me, he stood on my sword so that I couldn't lift it, sheathed his own blade and grabbed my head with his good left hand. \"Hurry!\" he barked at Steve. \"Kill him quick!\"</p><p>\"What's the rush?\" Steve muttered.</p><p>\"If Vancha dies of the wound I gave him, we'll have broken the rules of Mr Tiny's prophecy!\" Gannen shouted.</p><p>Steve pulled a face. \"Bloody prophecies,\" he grumbled. \"Maybe I'll let him die and see what happens. Maybe I don't care about Tiny or...\" He stopped and rolled his eyes. \"Oh, how silly we are! The answer's obvious - I'll kill Vancha before he dies of your wound. That way we'll fulfil the requirements of the stupid prophecy and I'll get to hang on to Darren, so I can torture him later.\"</p><p>\"Clever boy,\" I heard Mr Tiny murmur.</p><p>\"Have it any way you wish!\" Gannen roared. \"But if you're going to kill him, kill him now, so that-\"</p><p>\"No !\" someone screamed. Before anyone could react, a large shape shot out of the underpass beneath the bridge and hurled itself at Gannen, knocking him off me, almost toppling him into the river. Sitting up, I got a shocked fix on my most unlikely of rescuers - R. V. !</p><p>\"Not gonna let you do it, man!\" R.V. screamed, pounding Gannen Harst with his hooks. \"You're evil!\"</p><p>Gannen had been taken completely unawares, but he swiftly recovered, fumbled his sword free of its scabbard, and dug at R.V. with it. R.V. caught the sword with his gold right-handed hooks and smashed it against the ground, snapping it in two. With a roar of triumph, he slammed his silver left-handed hook into the side of Gannen's head. There was a crack and Gannen's eyes went blank. He slumped beneath R.V., unconscious. R.V. howled with joy, then drew both arms back to bring them down sharply and finish Gannen off.</p><p>Before R.V. could strike, Steve stepped up behind him and forced a knife up beneath his bushy beard, deep into his throat. R.V. shuddered and bowled Steve over. R.V. stood, spinning crazily, grabbing for the handle of the knife with his hooks. After missing it several times, he fell down, landing on his knees, head thrown back.</p><p>R.V. knelt there a moment, swaying sickeningly. Then his arms slowly rose. He gazed at the gold and silver hooks, his face glowing with wonder. \"My hands,\" he said softly, and although his voice was gurgly with blood, his words were clear. \"I can see them. My hands. They're back. Everything's OK now. I'm normal again, man.\" Then his arms dropped, his smile and pale red eyes froze in place, and his soul passed quietly on to the next world.</p><p>Chapter ELEVEN</p><p>I gazed at R.V.'s peaceful expression as he knelt in his death pose. He'd left his pain behind at last, for ever. I was glad for him. If he'd lived, he'd have had to carry around the memory of the evil he'd committed while in league with the vampaneze. Maybe he was better off this way.</p><p>\"And now there's two - just me and you,\" Steve trilled, breaking my train of thought. I glanced up and saw him standing a few metres away from R.V., smiling. Gannen Harst was still out for the count, and although Vancha was alive, he was lying motionless, wheezing fitfully, unable to defend himself or attack.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I agreed, standing and picking up my sword. My left hand wouldn't work and my system was maybe a minute or two away from complete shutdown. But I'd enough strength left for one last fight. First though - Vancha. I paused over him and studied at his wound. It was seeping blood and his face was creased with pain. He tried to speak but words wouldn't form.</p>","<p>As I hovered uncertainly by the side of my fellow Prince, unwilling to leave him like this, Evanna crossed to his side, knelt and examined him. Her eyes were grave when she looked up. \"It is not fatal,\" she said softly. \"He will live.\"</p><p>\"Thank you,\" I muttered.</p><p>\"Save your thanks,\" Mr Tiny said. He was standing directly behind me. \"She didn't tell you to cheer you up, silly boy. It was a warning. Vancha won't die for the time being, but he's out of the fight. You're alone. The final hunter. Unless you turn tail and run, it's down to you and Steve now. If Steve doesn't die, death will come within the next few minutes for you !\"</p><p>I looked over my shoulder at the small man in the yellow suit and green Wellington boots. His face was bright with bloodthirsty glee. \"If death comes,\" I said shortly, \"it will be a far more welcome companion than you.\"</p><p>Mr Tiny chuckled, then stepped away to my left. Rising, Evanna took up position on my right. Both waited for me to move, so that they could follow. I spared Vancha one final glance - he grinned painfully at me and winked - then faced Steve.</p><p>He backed away from me casually, entering the shadows beneath the bridge. I trailed after him, sword by my side, taking deep breaths, clearing my mind, focusing on the death-struggle to come. Although this could have been Vancha's battle, a part of me had known all along that it would come down to this. Steve and I were opposite sides of a coin, linked since childhood, first by friendship, then hatred. It was only fitting that the final confrontation should fall to the two of us.</p><p>I entered the cool darkness of the underpass. It took my eyes a few seconds to adjust. When they did, I saw Steve waiting, right eye twitching nervously. The river gurgled softly beside us, the only noise except for our panting and chattering teeth.</p><p>\"There is where we settle matters, once and for all, in the dark,\" Steve said.</p><p>\"As good a place as any,\" I replied.</p><p>Steve raised his left palm. I could vaguely make out the shape of the pink cross he'd carved into his flesh eighteen years before. \"Remember when I did this?\" he asked. \"That night, I swore I'd kill you and Creepy Crepsley.\"</p><p>\"You're halfway there,\" I noted dryly. \"You must be delighted.\"</p><p>\"Not really,\" he said. \"To be honest, I miss old Creepy. The world's not the same without him. I'll miss you even more. You've been the driving force behind everything I've done since I was a child. Without you, I'm not sure I'll have much of an interest in life. If possible, I'd let you go. I enjoy our games - the hunt, the traps, the fights. I'd happily keep doing it, over and over, a new twist here, a fresh shock there.\"</p><p>\"But life doesn't work like that,\" I said. \"Everything has to end.\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Steve said sadly. \"That's one thing I can't change.\" His mood passed and he regarded me with a sneer. \"Here's where you end, Darren Shan. This is your grand finale. Have you made your peace with the vampire gods?\"</p><p>\"I'll do that later,\" I snarled, and swung my sword wide, moving forward so that on its return arc he'd be within range. But before it had completed its first arc, the tip of the sword smashed into the wall. It bounced off in a shower of sparks and a shock ran down my arm.</p><p>\"Silly boy,\" Steve purred, mimicking Mr Tiny. He raised a knife. \"No room here for swords.\"</p><p>Steve leapt forward and jabbed the knife at me. I pulled back and lobbed my sword at him, momentarily halting him. In that second, I drew one of the knives I'd brought from Annie's kitchen. When Steve advanced, I was ready. I caught his thrust with the hilt of my knife and turned his blade aside.</p><p>There was no room in the underpass to circle one another, so we had to jab and stab, ducking and weaving to avoid each other's blows. The conditions actually played into my favour - in the open I'd have had to be nimbler on my feet, spinning to keep up with Steve. That would have exhausted me. Here, since we were so cramped, I could stand still and direct my rapidly dwindling strength into my knife hand.</p><p>We fought silently, fast, sharp, impulsive. Steve nicked the flesh of my forearm - I nicked his. He opened shallow wounds on my stomach and chest - I repaid the compliment. He almost cut my nose off - I nearly severed his left ear.</p><p>Then Steve came at me from the left, taking advantage of my dead arm. He grabbed the material of my shirt and pulled me towards him, driving his knife hard at my belly with his other hand. I rolled with the force of his pull, throwing myself into him. His knife cut the wall of my stomach, a deep wound, but my momentum carried me forward despite the pain. I drove him down, landing awkwardly on him as he hit the path. His right hand flew out by his side, fingers snapping open. His knife shot free and struck the river with a splash, vanishing from sight in an instant.</p><p>Steve brought his empty right hand up, to push me off. I stabbed at it with my knife and hit home, spearing him through his forearm. He screamed. I freed my knife before he could knock it from my grip, raised it to shoulder height and redirected it, so the tip was pointing at Steve's throat. His eyes shot to the gleam of the blade and his breath caught. This was it. I had him. He'd been out-fought and he knew it. One quick thrust of the knife and-</p><p>Searing pain. A white flash inside my head. I thought Gannen had recovered and struck me from behind, but he hadn't. It was an aftershock from when I blooded Darius. Vancha had warned me about this. My limbs trembled. A roaring in my ears, drowning out all other sounds. I dry-heaved and fell off Steve, almost tumbling into the river. \"No!\" I tried to scream. \"Not now!\" But I couldn't form the words. I was in the grip of immense pain, and could do nothing against it.</p><p>Time seemed to collapse. Gripped by panic, I was dimly aware of Steve crawling on top of me. He wrestled my knife from my hand. There was a sharp stabbing sensation in my stomach, followed by another. Steve crowed, \"Now I have you! Now you're gonna die.\" Something blurry passed in front of my eyes, then back again. Fighting the white light inside my head, I got my eyes to focus. It was the knife. Steve had pulled it out and was waving it in my face, teasing me, sure he'd won, prolonging the moment of triumph.</p><p>But Steve had miscalculated. The pain of the stabbing brought me back from the brink of all-out confusion. The agony in my gut worked against the pain in my head, and the world began to swim back into place around me. Steve was perched on top of me, laughing. But I wasn't afraid. Unknown to himself, he was helping me. I was able to think halfway straight now, able to plan, able to act.</p>","<p>My right hand stole to waist of my trousers as Steve continued to mock me. I gripped the handle of a second knife. I caught a glimpse of Mr Tiny peering over Steve's shoulder. He'd seen my hand moving and knew what was coming. He was nodding, though I'm not sure if he was encouraging me or merely bobbing his head up and down with excitement.</p><p>I lay still, gathering my very last dredges of energy together, letting Steve torment me with wild promises of what was to come. I was bleeding freely from the stab wounds in my stomach. I wasn't sure if I'd be alive come the dawn, but of one thing I was certain - Steve would die before me.</p><p>\"-and when I finish with your toes and fingers, I'll move on to your nose and ears!\" Steve yelled. \"But first I'll cut your eyelids off, so you can see everything that I'm gonna do. After that I'll-\"</p><p>\"Steve,\" I wheezed, stopping him midflow. \"Want to know the secret of winning a fight like this? Less talking - more stabbing.\"</p><p>I lunged at him, using the muscles of my stomach to force my body up. Steve wasn't prepared for it. I knocked him backwards. As he fell, I swung my legs around, then pushed with my knees and feet, so I drove him all the way back with the full weight of my body. He hit the pavement with a grunt, for the second time within the space of a few minutes. This time he managed to hold on to his knife, but that was no use to him. I wasn't going to make the same mistake twice.</p><p>No hesitation. No pausing to pick my point. No cynical, memorable last words. I put my trust in the gods of the vampires and blindly thrust my knife forward. I brought it around and down in a savage arc, and by luck or fate drove it into the centre of Steve's left breast - clean through his shrivelled forgery of a heart!</p><p>Chapter TWELVE</p><p>Steve's eyes and mouth popped wide with shock. His expression was comical, but I was in no mood to laugh. There was no recovery from a strike like that. Steve was finished. But he could take me with him if I wasn't careful. So instead of celebrating, I grabbed his left hand, holding it down tight by his side so he couldn't use his knife on me.</p><p>Steve's gaze slid to the handle of the knife sticking out of his chest. \"Oh,\" he said tonelessly. Then blood trickled from the sides of his mouth. His chest heaved up and down, the handle rising and falling with it. I wanted to pull the knife out, to end matters - he could maybe go on like this for a minute or two, the knife stopping the gush of blood from his heart - but my left hand was useless and I didn't dare free my right.</p><p>Then - applause. My head lifted, and Steve's eyes rolled back in their sockets so that he could look behind him. Mr Tiny was clapping, bright red tears of joy dripping down his cheeks. \"What passion!\" he exclaimed. \"What valour! What a never-say-die spirit! My money was always on you, Darren. It could have gone either way, but if I was a betting man, I'd have bet big on you. I said as much beforehand, didn't I, Evanna?\"</p><p>\"Yes, father,\" Evanna answered quietly. She was studying me sadly. Her lips moved silently, but even though she uttered no sounds, I was able to make out what she said. \"To the victor, the spoils.\"</p><p>\"Come, Darren,\" Mr Tiny said. \"Pull out the knife and tend to your wounds. They're not immediately life-threatening, but you should have a doctor see to them. Your friends in the stadium are almost done with their foes. They'll be coming soon. They can take you to a hospital.\"</p><p>I shook my head. I only meant that I couldn't pull the knife out, but Mr Tiny must have thought I didn't want to kill Steve. \"Don't be foolish,\" he snapped. \"Steve is the enemy. He deserves no mercy. Finish him, then take your place as the rightful ruler of the night.\"</p><p>\"You are the Lord of the Shadows now,\" Evanna said. \"There is no room in your life for mercy. Do as my father bids. The sooner you accept your destiny, the easier it will be for you.\"</p><p>\"And do you... want me to... kill Vancha now too?\" I panted angrily.</p><p>\"Not yet,\" Mr Tiny laughed. \"That will come in its own time.\" His laughter faded and his expression hardened.</p><p>\"Much will come in time. The vampaneze will fall, and so shall the humans. This world will be yours, Darren - rather, ours . Together we'll rule. Your hand at the tiller, my voice in your ear. I'll guide and advise you. Not openly - I haven't the power to directly steer you - but on the sly. I'll make suggestions, you'll heed them, and together we'll build a world of chaos and twisted beauty.\"</p><p>\"What makes you... think I'd have anything to do... with a monster like you?\" I snarled.</p><p>\"He has a point, father,\" Evanna murmured. \"We both know what lies in store for Darren. He will become a ruler of savage, unrelenting power. But he hates you. That hatred will increase over the centuries, not diminish. What makes you think you can rule with him?\"</p><p>\"I know more about the boy than you do,\" Mr Tiny said smugly. \"He will accept me. He was born to.\" Mr Tiny squatted and looked straight down into Steve's eyes. Then he looked up into mine, his face no more than five or six centimetres away. \"I have always been there for you. For both of you,\" he whispered. \"When you competed with your friends for a ticket to the Cirque Du Freak,\" he said to me, \"I whispered in your ear and told you when to grab for it.\"</p><p>My jaw dropped. I had heard a voice that day, but I'd thought it was only an inner voice, the voice of instinct.</p><p>\"And when you,\" he said to Steve, \"noticed something strange about Darren after your meeting with Larten Crepsley, who do you think kept you awake at night, filling your thoughts with doubt and suspicion?\"</p><p>Mr Tiny pulled back half a metre. His smile had returned, and it now threatened to spread from his face and fill the tunnel. \"I influenced Crepsley and inspired him to blood Darren. I urged Gannen Harst to suggest Steve try the Coffin of Fire. Both of you have enjoyed enormous slices of good fortune in life. You put it down to the luck of the vampires, or the survival instinct of the vampaneze. But it was neither. You owe your nine cat's lives - and quite a few more - to me.\"</p><p>\"I don't understand,\" I said, confused and alarmed. \"Why would you go to all that trouble? Why ruin our lives?\"</p><p>\"Ruin ?\" he barked. \"With my help you became a Prince and Steve became a Lord. With my backing the two of you have led the creatures of the night to war, and one of you - you, Darren! - now stands poised to become the most powerful tyrant in the history of the world. I have made your lives, not ruined them!\"</p>","<p>\"But why us?\" I pressed. \"We were ordinary kids. Why pick on Steve and me?\"</p><p>\"You were never ordinary,\" Mr Tiny disagreed. \"From birth - no, from conception you were both unique.\" He stood and looked at Evanna. She was staring at him uncertainly - this was news to her too. \"For a long time I wondered what it would be like to father children,\" Mr Tiny said softly. \"When, spurred on by a stubborn vampire, I finally decided to give parenthood a try, I created two offspring in my own mould, beings of magic and great power.</p><p>\"Evanna and Hibernius fascinated me at first, but in time I grew tired of their limitations. Because they can see into the future, they - like me - are limited in what they can do in the present. All of us have to abide by laws not of our making. I can interfere in the affairs of mankind more than my children can, but not as much as I'd wish. In many ways my hands are tied. I can influence mortals, and I do, but they're contrary creatures and short-lived. It's difficult to manipulate large groups of humans over a long period of time - especially now that there are billions of them!</p><p>\"What I longed for was a mortal I could channel my will through, a being not bound by the laws of the universe, nor shackled by the confines of humanity. My ally would have to start as a human, then become a vampire or vampaneze. With my help he would lead his clan to rule over all. Together we could govern the course of the world for hundreds of years to come, and through his children I could control it for thousands of years - maybe even the rest of time itself.\"</p><p>\"You're mad,\" I growled. \"I don't care if you did help me. I won't work with you or do what you want. I'm not going to link myself to your warped cause. I doubt that Steve would have either, if he'd won.\"</p><p>\"But you will join me,\" Mr Tiny insisted, \"just as Steve would have. You must. It's in your nature. Like sides with like.\" He paused, then said proudly and provocatively, \"Son sides with sire.\"</p><p>\"What ?\" Evanna exploded, leaping to an understanding sooner than I did.</p><p>\"I required a less powerful heir,\" Mr Tiny said, his gaze fixed on me. \"One who'd carry my genes and mirror my desires, but who could act freely as a mortal. To weed out any weaknesses, I created a pair, then set them against each other. The weaker would perish and be forgotten. The stronger would go on to claim the world.\" He stuck his arms out, the gesture both mocking and strangely heartfelt. \"Come and give your father a hug, Darren - my son !\"</p><p>Chapter THIRTEEN</p><p>\"You're mad!\" I croaked. \"I have a father, a real dad. It isn't you!\"</p><p>\"Dermot Shan was not your father,\" Mr Tiny replied. \"You were a cuckoo's child. Steve too. I did my work quietly, unknown to your mothers. But trust me - you're both mine.\"</p><p>\"This is outrageous!\" Evanna screeched, her body expanding, becoming more that of a wolf than human, until she filled most of the tunnel. \"It is forbidden! How dare you!\"</p><p>\"I acted within the confines of the universe's laws!\" Mr Tiny snapped. \"You'd know if I had not - all would be chaos. I stretched them a bit, but I didn't break them. I am allowed to breed, and my children - if they lack my magical powers - can act the same way as any normal mortal.\"</p><p>\"But if Darren and Steve are your sons, then you have created the future where one of them becomes the Lord of the Shadows!\" Evanna roared. \"You have cast mankind into the abyss, and twisted the strands of the future to suit your own foul needs!\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Mr Tiny chuckled, then pointed a finger at Evanna. \"Do not cross me on this, daughter. I would not harm my own flesh and blood, but I could make life very unpleasant if you got on the wrong side of me.\"</p><p>Evanna glared at her father hatefully, then gradually resumed her regular shape and size. \"This is unjust,\" she muttered. \"The universe will punish you, perhaps not immediately, but eventually you'll pay a price for your arrogance.\"</p><p>\"I doubt it,\" Mr Tiny smirked. \"Mankind was heading towards an all-time boring low. Peace, prosperity, global communication, brotherly love - where's the fun in that ! Yes, there were still plenty of wars and conflicts to enjoy, but I could see the people of the world moving ever closer together. I did my best, nudged nations along the path to battle, sowed seeds of discontent everywhere I could, even helped get a few tyrants wrongfully elected to some of the most powerful positions on Earth - I was sure those fine specimens would push the world to the brink!</p><p>\"But no! No matter how tense things got, no matter how much meddling my minions did, I could see peace and understanding gradually winning through. It was time for drastic action, to take the world back to the good old days, when everyone was at everybody else's throat. I've simply restored the natural order of beautiful chaos. The universe won't punish me for that. If anything, I expect-\"</p><p>\"Shut up!\" I screamed, surprising both Mr Tiny and Evanna. \"It's bull, all of it! You're not my father! You're a monster!\"</p><p>\"And so are you,\" Mr Tiny beamed. \"Or soon will be. But don't worry, son - monsters have all the fun!\"</p><p>I stared at him, sickened, senses reeling, unable to take it all in. If this was true, everything in my life had been false. I was never the person I thought I was, only a pawn of Mr Tiny's, a time bomb waiting to explode. I'd been blooded simply to extend my life, so I could live longer and do more of Mr Tiny's work. My war with Steve had served only to get rid of the weaker of us, so that the stronger could emerge as a more powerful beast. I'd done nothing for the sake of the vampires or my family and friends - everything had been for Mr Tiny. And now that I'd proved myself worthy, I'd become a dictator and lay low anyone who opposed him. My wishes would count for nothing. It was my destiny.</p><p>\"Fa-fa-fa...\" Steve stammered, spitting blood from his mouth. With his free hand he reached out to Mr Tiny. \"Father,\" he managed to croak. \"Help... me.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" Mr Tiny sniffed.</p><p>\"I... never... had... a... Dad.\" Each word was a heart-churning effort, but Steve forced them out. \"I... want... to... know... you. I'll... serve... you... and... love... you.\"</p><p>\"What on earth would I want with love ?\" Mr Tiny laughed. \"Love is one of the most basic human emotions. I'm so pleased I was never cursed with it. Servitude, gratitude, fear, hatred, anger - these I like. Love... you can take your love to the Lake of Souls when you die. Perhaps it will provide you with some comfort there.\"</p>","<p>\"But... I'm... your... son,\" Steve cried weakly.</p><p>\"You were,\" Mr Tiny sneered. \"Now you're just a loser, and soon you'll be dead meat. I'll toss your carcass to my Little People to eat - that's how little I feel for you. This is a winner's world. Second place equals second rate. You're nothing to me. Darren's my only son now.\"</p><p>The pain in Steve's eyes was awful to behold. As a child, he'd been crushed when he thought I'd betrayed him. Now he'd been openly mocked and disowned by his father. It destroyed him. His heart had been full of hatred before this, but now that it was down to its last few beats, there was room only for despair.</p><p>But in Steve's anguish I found hope. Consumed by smugness, Mr Tiny had revealed too much, too soon. At the back of my brain an idea sparked into life. In a whirl I began to put various pieces together - Mr Tiny's revelation and Evanna's reaction. Evanna said Mr Tiny had created the future in which Steve or I was the Lord of the Shadows. He'd bent the laws he and she lived by, to twist things round and build a chaotic world which he and I could rule over. Evanna and Mr Tall had told me there was no escaping the Lord of the Shadows, that he was part of the world's future. But they were wrong. He was part of Mr Tiny's future. Des Tiny might be the most powerful individual in the universe, but he was still only an individual. What one individual could build, another could destroy.</p><p>Mr Tiny's eyes were on Steve. He was laughing at him, enjoying Steve's dying misery. Evanna's head was bowed - she'd given in and accepted this. Not me. If I'd inherited Mr Tiny's evil, destructive streak, I'd also inherited his cunning. I'd stop at nothing to deny him his vision of a ruined future.</p><p>Slowly, everso slowly, I released Steve's left hand and moved my arm away. He had a free shot at my stomach now, in the perfect position to finish the job he'd started when he stabbed me earlier. But Steve didn't notice. He was wrapped up in his sorrow. I faked a cough and plucked at his left sleeve. If Mr Tiny had seen it, he could have stopped my plan there. But he thought he'd won, that it was all over. He couldn't even imagine the vaguest possibility of a threat.</p><p>Steve's gaze flickered down. He realized his hand was free. He saw his chance to kill me. His fingers stiffened on the handle of his knife... then relaxed. For a terrible moment I thought he'd died, but then I saw that he was still alive. What made him pause was doubt. He'd spent most of his life hating me, but now he'd been told I was his brother. I could see his brain churning. I was a victim of Des Tiny, just as he was. He'd been wrong to hate me - I'd had no choice in what I'd done. In all the world, I was the person he should be closest to, and instead I was the person he'd hurt the most.</p><p>What Steve found in those last few moments was what I thought he'd lost for ever - his humanity. He saw the error of his ways, the evil he'd committed, the mistakes he'd made. There was possible salvation in that recognition. Now that he could see himself for what he truly was, perhaps, even at this late stage, he could repent.</p><p>But I couldn't afford humanity. Steve's salvation would be my undoing - and the world's. I needed him mad as hell, fire in his gut, filled with fury and hate. Only in that state could he find the power to maybe help me break Des Tiny's hold over the future.</p><p>\"Steve,\" I said, forcing a wicked smile. \"You were right. I did plot with Mr Crepsley to take your place as his assistant. We made a mug of you, and I'm glad. You're a nobody. A nothing. This is what you deserve. If Mr Crepsley was alive, he'd be laughing at you now, just like the rest of us are.\"</p><p>Mr Tiny howled with delight. \"That's my boy!\" he hooted. He thought I was getting one last dig in before Steve died. But he was wrong.</p><p>Steve's eyes refilled with hatred. The human within him vanished in an instant and he was Steve Leopard, vampire killer, again. In one fast, crazed movement he brought his left hand up and drove his knife deep into my stomach. Less than a second later he did it again, then again.</p><p>\"Stop!\" Mr Tiny yelled, seeing the danger too late. He lurched at us, to pull me off, but Evanna slid in front of him and blocked his way.</p><p>\"No, father!\" she snapped. \"You cannot interfere in this!\"</p><p>\"Get out of my way!\" he bellowed, struggling with her. \"The fool's going to let Leonard kill him! We have to stop it!\"</p><p>\"Too late,\" I giggled, as Steve's blade slid in and sliced through my guts for a fifth time. Mr Tiny stopped and blinked dumbly, at a complete loss for what may well have been the first time in his long, ungodly life. \"Destiny... rejected,\" I said with my final whole breath. Then I grabbed Steve tight as he lunged at me with his knife again, and rolled to my right, off the edge of the path, into the river.</p><p>We went into the water together, wrapped in each other's arms, and sank quickly. Steve tried stabbing me again, but it was too much for him. He went limp and fell away from me, his dead body dropping into the dark depths of the river, disappearing from sight within seconds.</p><p>I was barely conscious, hanging sluggishly, limbs being picked at and made to sway by the current of the river. Water rushed down my throat and flooded my lungs. Part of me wanted to strike for the surface, but I fought against it, not wanting to give Mr Tiny even the slightest opportunity to revive me.</p><p>I saw faces in the water, or in my thoughts - impossible to tell the difference. Sam Grest, Gavner Purl, Arra Sails, Mr Tall, Shancus, R.V., Mr Crepsley. The dead, come to welcome me.</p><p>I stretched my arms out to them, but our fingers didn't touch. I imagined Mr Crepsley waving, and a sad expression crossed his face. Then everything faded. I stopped struggling. The world, the water, the faces faded from sight, then from memory. A roaring which was silence. A darkness which was light. A chill which burnt. One final flutter of my eyelids, barely a movement, impossibly tiring. And then, in the lonely, watery darkness of the river, as all must do when the Grim Reaper calls - I died.</p><p>INTERLUDE</p><p>Timelessness. Eternal gloom. Drifting in slow, never-ending circles. Surrounded but alone. Aware of other souls, trapped like me, but unable to contact them. No sense of sight, hearing, taste, smell, touch. Only the crushing boredom of the present and painful memories of the past.</p><p>I know this place. It's the Lake of Souls, a zone where spirits go when they can't leave Earth's pull. Some people's souls don't move on when they die. They remain trapped in the waters of this putrid lake, condemned to swirl silently in the depths for all eternity.</p>","<p>I'm sad I ended up here, but not surprised. I tried to live a good life, and I sacrificed myself at the end in an effort to save others, so in those respects I was maybe deserving of Paradise. But I was also a killer. Whatever my reasons, I took lives and created unhappiness. I don't know if some higher power has passed judgement on me, or if I'm imprisoned by my own guilt. It doesn't really matter, I guess. I'm here and there's no getting out. This is my lot. For ever.</p><p>No sense of time. No days, nights, hours, minutes - not even seconds. Have I been here a week, a year, a century? Can't tell. Does the War of the Scars still rage? Have the vampires or vampaneze fallen? Has another taken my place as the Lord of the Shadows? Did I die for no reason? I don't know. I probably never will. That's part of my sentence. Part of my curse.</p><p>If the souls of the dead could speak, they'd scream for release. Not just release from the Lake, but from their memories. Memories gnaw away at me relentlessly. I remember so much of my past, all the times where I failed or could have done better. With nothing else to do, I'm forced to review my life, over and over. Even my most minor errors become supreme lapses of judgement. They torment me worse than Steve ever did.</p><p>I try to hide from the pain of the memories by retreating further into my past. I remember the young Darren Shan, human, happy, normal, innocent. I spend years, decades - or is it just minutes? - reliving the simple, carefree times. I piece together my entire early life. I recall even the smallest details - the colours of toy cars, homework assignments, throwaway conversations. I go through everyday chat a hundred times, until every word is correct. The longer I think about it, the deeper into those years I sink, losing myself, human again, almost able to believe that the memories are reality, and my death and the Lake of Souls nothing but an unpleasant dream.</p><p>But eternity can't be dodged for ever. My later memories are always hovering, picking away at the boundaries of the limited reality which I've built. Every so often I flash ahead to a face or event. Then I lose control and find myself thrust into the darker, nightmarish world of my life as a half-vampire. I relive the mistakes, the wrong choices, the bloodshed.</p><p>So many friends lost, so many enemies killed. I feel responsible for all of them. I believed in peace when I first went to Vampire Mountain. Even though Kurda Smahlt betrayed his people, I felt sorry for him. I knew he did it in an effort to avoid war. I couldn't understand why it had come to this. If only the vampires and vampaneze had sat down and talked through their differences, war could have been avoided.</p><p>When I first became a Prince, I dreamt of being a peace-monger, taking up where Kurda left off, bringing the vampaneze back into the clan. I lost those dreams somewhere during the six years I spent living within Vampire Mountain. Surviving as a vampire, learning their ways, training with weapons, sending friends out to fight and die... It all rubbed off on me, and when I finally returned to the world beyond the mountain, I'd changed. I was a warrior, fierce, unmoved by death, intent on killing rather than talking.</p><p>I wasn't evil. Sometimes it's necessary to fight. There are occasions when you have to cast aside your nobler ideals and get your hands dirty. But you should always strive for peace, and search to find the peaceful solution to even the most bloody of conflicts. I didn't do that. I embraced the war and went along with the general opinion - that if we killed the Vampaneze Lord, all our problems would be solved and life would be hunky-dory.</p><p>We were wrong. The death of one man never solved anything. Steve was just the start. Once you set off down the road of murder, it's hard to take a detour. We couldn't have stopped. The death of one foe wouldn't have been enough. We'd have set about annihilating the vampaneze after Steve, then humanity. We'd have established ourselves as the rulers of the world, crushing all in our path, and I'd have gone along with it. No, more than that - I'd have led, not just followed.</p><p>That guilt, not just of what I've done but of what I would have done, eats away at me like a million ravenous rats. It doesn't matter that I'm the son of Desmond Tiny, that wickedness was in my genes. I had the power to break away from the dark designs of my father. I proved that at the end, by letting myself die. But why didn't I do it sooner, before so many people were killed?</p><p>I don't know if I could have stopped the war, but I could have said, \"No, I don't want any part of this.\" I could have argued for peace, not fought for it. If I'd failed, at least I maybe wouldn't have wound up here, weighed down by the chains of so many grisly deaths.</p><p>Time passes. Faces swim in and out of my thoughts. Memories form, are forgotten, form again. I blank out large parts of my life, recover them, blank them out again. I succumb to madness and forget who I was. But the madness doesn't last. I reluctantly return to my senses.</p><p>I think about my friends a lot, especially those who were alive when I died. Did any of them perish in the stadium? If they survived that, what came next? Since Steve and I both died, what happened with the War of the Scars? Could Mr Tiny replace us with new leaders, men with the same powers as Steve and me? Hard to see how, unless he fathered another couple of children.</p><p>Was Harkat alive now, pushing for peace between the vampires and vampaneze, like he had when he was Kurda Smahlt? Had Alice Burgess led her vampirites against the vampets and crushed them? Did Debbie mourn for me? Not knowing was an agony. I'd have sold my soul to the Devil for a few minutes in the world of the living, where I could find answers to my questions. But not even the Devil disturbed the waters of the Lake of Souls. This was the exclusive resting place of the dead and the damned.</p><p>Drifting, ghostly, resigned. I fixate on my death, remembering Steve's face as he stabbed me, his hatred, his fear. I count the number of seconds it took me to die, the drops of blood I spilt on the riverbank where he killed me. I feel myself topple into the water of the river a dozen times... a hundred... a thousand.</p><p>That water was so much more alive than the water of the Lake of Souls. Currents. Fish swam in it. Air bubbles. Cold. The water here is dead, as lifeless as the souls it contains. No fish explore its depths, no insects skim its surface. I'm not sure how I'm aware of these facts, but I am. I sense the awful emptiness of the Lake. It exists solely to hold the spirits of the miserable dead.</p><p>I long for the river. I'd meet any asking price if I could go back and experience the rush of flowing water again, the chill as I fell in, the pain as I bled to death. Anything's better than this limbo world. Even a minute of dying is preferable to an eternity of nothingness.</p>","<p>One small measure of comfort - as bad as this is for me, it must be much worse for Steve. My guilt is nothing compared to his. I was sucked into Mr Tiny's evil games, but Steve threw himself heart and soul into them. His crimes far outweigh mine, so his suffering must be that much more.</p><p>Unless he doesn't accept his guilt. Perhaps eternity means nothing to him. Maybe he's just sore that I beat him. It could be that he doesn't worry about what he did, or realize just how much of a monster he was. He might be content here, reflecting with fondness on all that he achieved.</p><p>But I doubt it. I suspect Mr Tiny's admission destroyed a large part of Steve's mad defences. Knowing that he was my brother, and that we were both puppets in our father's hands, must have shaken him up. I think, given the time to reflect - and that's all one can do here - he'll weep for what he did. He'll see himself for what he truly was, and hate himself for it.</p><p>I shouldn't take pleasure in that. There, but for the grace of the gods... But I still despise Steve. I can understand why he acted that way, and I'm sorry for him. But I can't forgive him. I can't stretch that far. Perhaps that's another reason why I'm here.</p><p>I'm retreating from the painful memories again. Withdrawing from the vampire world, pretending it never happened. I imagine myself as a child, living the same days over and over, refusing to go beyond the afternoon when I won a ticket to the Cirque Du Freak. I build a perfect, sealed-off, comfortable reality. I'm Darren Shan, loving son and brother, not the best behaved boy in the world, but far from the worst. I do chores for Mum and Dad, struggle with homework, watch TV, hang out with my friends. One moment I'm six or seven years old, the next ten or eleven. Continually twisting back upon myself, living the past, ignoring all that I don't want to think about. Steve's my best friend. We read comics, watch horror movies, tell jokes to each other. Annie's a child, always a child - I never think of her as a woman with a son of her own. Vampires are monsters of myth, like werewolves, zombies, mummies, not to be taken seriously.</p><p>It's my aim to become the Darren of my memories, to lose myself completely in the past. I don't want to deal with the guilt any more. I've gone mad before and recovered. I want to go mad again, but this time let madness swallow me whole.</p><p>I struggle to vanish into the past. Remembering everything, painting the details more precisely every time I revisit a moment. I start to forget about the souls, the Lake, the vampires and vampaneze. I still get occasional flashes of reality, but I clamp down on them quickly. Thinking as a child, remembering as a child, becoming a child.</p><p>I'm almost there. The madness waits, arms spread wide, welcoming me. I'll be living a lie, but it will be a peaceful, soothing lie. I long for it. I work hard to make it real. And I'm getting there. I feel myself sliding closer towards it. I reach for the lie with the tendrils of my mind. I feel around it, explore it, start to slip inside it, when all of a sudden - a new sensation...</p><p>Pain! Heaviness. Rising. The madness is left behind. The water of the Lake closes around me. Searing pain! Thrashing, coughing, gasping. But with what ? I have no arms to thrash, no mouth to cough, no lungs to gasp. Is this part of the madness? Am I...</p><p>And suddenly my head - an actual, real head ! - breaks the surface. I'm breathing air. Sunlight blinds me. I spit water out. My arms come clear of the Lake. I'm surrounded, but not by the souls of the dead - by nets! People pulling on them. Coming out of the Lake. Screaming with pain and confusion - but no sounds. Body forming, incredibly heavy after all this weightless time. I land on hard, warm earth. My feet drag out of the water. Amazed, I try to stand. I make it to my knees, then fall. I hit the ground hard. Pain again, fresh and frightening. I curl up into a ball, shivering like a baby. I shut my eyes against the light and dig my fingers into the earth to reassure myself that it's real. And then I sob feebly as the incredible, bewildering, impossible realization sinks in - I'm alive !</p><p>PART TWO</p><p>Chapter FOURTEEN</p><p>The sun hammered down fiercely upon me but I couldn't stop shivering. Someone threw a blanket around me, hairy and thick. It itched like mad, but the sensation was delicious. Any sensation would have been welcome after the numbness of the Lake of Souls.</p><p>The person who'd draped the blanket over me knelt by my side and tilted my head back. I blinked water from my eyes and focused. It took a few seconds, but finally I fixed on my rescuer. It was a Little Person. At first I thought it was Harkat. I opened my mouth to shout his name happily. Then I did a double take and realized this wasn't my old friend, just one of his grey, scarred, green-eyed kind.</p><p>The Little Person examined me silently, prodding and poking. Then he stood and stepped aside, leaving me. I wrapped the blanket tighter around myself, trying to stop the shivers. After a while I worked up the strength to look around. I was lying by the rim of the Lake of Souls. The earth around me was hard and dry, like desert. Several Little People stood nearby. A couple were hanging up nets to dry - the nets they'd fished me out with. The others simply stared off into space or at the Lake.</p><p>There was a screeching sound high overhead. Looking up, I saw a huge winged beast circling the Lake. From my previous trip here, I knew it was a dragon. My insides clenched with fear. Then I noticed a second dragon. A third. A fourth. Jaw dropping, I realized the sky was full of them, dozens, maybe hundreds. If they caught sight of me...</p><p>I started to scrabble weakly for safety, then paused and glanced at the Little People. They knew the dragons were there, but they weren't bothered by the giant flying reptiles. They might have dragged me out of the Lake to feed me to the dragons, but I didn't think so. And even if they had, in my feeble state I could do nothing about it. I couldn't flee or fight, and there was nowhere to hide. So I just lay where I was and waited for events to run their course.</p><p>For several minutes the dragons circled and the Little People stood motionless. I was still filled with a great chill, but I wasn't shivering quite as much as when I first came out of the Lake. I was gathering what small amounts of energy I could call on, to try and walk over to the Little People and quiz them about what was going on, when somebody spoke behind me.</p><p>\"Sorry I'm late.\"</p><p>I looked over my shoulder, expecting Mr Tiny, but it was his daughter, (my half-sister!) Evanna, striding towards me.</p><p>She looked no different from how I remembered her, though there was a sparkle in her green and brown eyes which had been absent when last we met.</p>","<p>\"Whuh!\" I croaked, the only sound I was able to make.</p><p>\"Easy,\" Evanna said, reaching me and bending to squeeze my shoulder warmly. \"Don't try to speak. It will take a few hours for the effects of the Lake to wear off. I'll build a fire and cook some broth for you. That's why I wasn't here when you were fished out - I was looking for firewood.\" She pointed to a mound of logs and branches.</p><p>I wanted to besiege her with questions, but there was no point taxing my throat when it wasn't ready to work. So I said nothing as she picked me up and carried me to the pile of wood like a baby, then set me down and turned her attention to the kindling.</p><p>When the fire was burning nicely, Evanna took a flat circular object out from beneath the ropes she was wearing. I recognized it immediately - a collapsible pot, the same sort that Mr Crepsley had once used. She pressed it in the middle, causing it to pop outwards and assume its natural shape, then filled it with water (not from the Lake, but from a bucket) and some grass and herbs, and hung it from a stick over the flames.</p><p>The broth was weak and tasteless, but its warmth was like the fire of the gods to me. I drank deeply, one bowl, another, a third. Evanna smiled as I slurped, then sipped slowly from a bowl of her own. The dragons screeched at regular intervals overhead, the sun burnt brightly, and the scent of the smoke was magical. I felt strangely relaxed, as if this was a lazy summer Sunday afternoon.</p><p>I was halfway through my fourth bowl before my stomach growled at me to say, \"Enough!\" Sighing happily, I laid the bowl down and sat, smiling lightly, thinking only of the good feelings inside. But I couldn't sit silently for ever, so eventually I raised my gaze, looked at Evanna and tested my vocal chords. \"Urch,\" I creaked - I'd meant to say \"Thanks.\"</p><p>\"It's been a long time since you spoke,\" Evanna said. \"Start simply. Try the alphabet. I will hunt for more wood, to sustain the fire. We won't be staying here much longer, but we may as well have warmth while we are. Practise while I am gone, and we can maybe talk when I return.\"</p><p>I did as the witch advised. At first I struggled to produce sounds anything like they should be, but I stuck with it and gradually my As started to sound like As, my Bs like Bs, and so on. When I'd run through the alphabet several times without making a mistake, I moved on to words, simple stuff to begin with - cat, dog, Mum, Dad, sky, me. I tried names after that, longer words, and finally sentences. It hurt to speak, and I slurred some words, but when Evanna eventually came back, clutching an armful of pitiful twigs, I was able to greet her in a gravelly but semi-normal voice. \"Thanks for the broth.\"</p><p>\"You're welcome.\" She threw some of the twigs on to the fire, then sat beside me. \"How do you feel?\"</p><p>\"Rough as rust.\"</p><p>\"Do you remember your name?\"</p><p>I squinted at her oddly. \"Why shouldn't I?\"</p><p>\"The Lake twists the minds of people,\" she said. \"It can destroy memories. Many of the souls forget who they are. They go mad and lose track of their pasts. You were in there a long time. I feared the worst.\"</p><p>\"I came close,\" I admitted, hunching up closer to the fire, recalling my attempts to go mad and escape the weight of my memories. \"It was horrible. Easier to be crazy in there than sane.\"</p><p>\"So what is it?\" Evanna asked. When I blinked dumbly, she laughed. \"Your name?\"</p><p>\"Oh.\" I smiled. \"Darren. Darren Shan. I'm a half-vampire. I remember it all, the War of the Scars, Mr Crepsley, Steve.\" My features darkened. \"I remember my death, and what Mr Tiny said just before it.\"</p><p>\"Quite the one for surprises, isn't he - our father?\"</p><p>She looked at me sideways to see what I'd say about that, but I couldn't think of anything - how do you respond to the news that Des Tiny is your dad, and a centuries-old witch is your half-sister? To avoid the subject, I studied the land around me. \"This place looks different,\" I said. \"It was green when I came with Harkat, lots of grass and fresh earth.\"</p><p>\"This is further into the future,\" Evanna explained. \"Before, you travelled a mere two hundred or so years ahead of the present. This time you have come hundreds of thousands of years, maybe more. I'm not entirely certain. This is the first time our father has ever allowed me to come here.\"</p><p>\"Hundreds of...\" My head spun.</p><p>\"This is the age of dragons,\" Evanna said. \"The age after mankind.\"</p><p>My breath caught in my throat, and I had to clear it twice before I could respond. \"You mean humanity has died out?\"</p><p>\"Died out or moved on to other worlds or spheres.\" Evanna shrugged. \"I cannot say for sure. I know only that the world belongs to dragons now. They control it as humans once did, and dinosaurs before them.\"</p><p>\"And the War of the Scars?\" I asked nervously. \"Who won that?\"</p><p>Evanna was silent a moment. Then she said, \"We have much to speak about. Let's not rush.\" She pointed at the dragons high above us. \"Call one of them down.\"</p><p>\"What?\" I frowned.</p><p>\"Call them, the way you used to call Madam Octa. You can control dragons like you controlled your pet spider.\"</p><p>\"How?\" I asked, bewildered.</p><p>\"I will show you. But first - call.\" She smiled. \"They will not harm us. You have my word.\"</p><p>I wasn't too sure about that, but how cool would it be to control a dragon! Looking up, I studied the creatures in the sky, then fixed on one slightly smaller than the others. (I didn't want to bring a large one down, in case Evanna was wrong and it attacked.) I tracked it with my eyes for a few seconds, then stretched out a hand towards it and whispered, \"Come to me. Come down. Come, my beauty.\"</p><p>The dragon executed a backwards somersault, then dropped swiftly. I thought it was going to blast us into a thousand pieces. I panicked and tried to run. Evanna hauled me back into place. \"Calmly,\" she said. \"You cannot control it if you break contact, and now that it knows we are here, it would be dangerous to let it have its own way.\"</p><p>I didn't want to play this game, but it was too late to back out now. With my heart beating fiercely, I fixed on the swooping dragon and spoke to it again. \"Easy. Pull up. I don't want to hurt you - and I don't want you to hurt us! Just hover above us a bit and...\"</p><p>The dragon pulled out of its fall and came to a halt several metres overhead. It flapped its leathery wings powerfully. I could hear nothing over the sound, and the force of the air knocked me backwards. As I struggled to right myself, the dragon came to land close beside me. It tucked its wings in, thrust its head down as though it meant to gobble me up, then stopped and just stared.</p>","<p>The beast was much like those I'd seen before. Its wings were a light green colour, it was about six metres long, scaled like a snake, with a bulging chest and thin tail. The scales on its stomach were a dull red and gold colour, while those on top were green with red flecks. It had two long forelegs near the front of its body, and two small hindlegs about a quarter of the way from the rear. Lots of sharp claws. A head like an alligator, long and flat, with bulging yellow eyes and small pointed ears. Its face was dark purple. It also had a long forked tongue and, if it was like the other dragons, it could blow fire.</p><p>\"It's incredible,\" Evanna said. \"This is the first time I have seen one up so close. Our father excelled himself with this creation.\"</p><p>\"Mr Tiny made the dragons?\"</p><p>Evanna nodded. \"He helped human scientists create them. Actually, one of your friends was a key member of the team - Alan Morris. With our father's aid he made a breakthrough which allowed them to be cloned from a combination of dinosaur cells.\"</p><p>\"Alan ?\" I snorted. \"You're telling me Alan Morris made dragons? That's total and utter...\" I stopped short. Tommy had told me Alan was a scientist, and that he'd specialized in cloning. It was hard to believe the foolish boy I'd known had grown up to become a creator of dinosaurs - but then again, it was hard to believe Steve had become the Vampaneze Lord, or myself a Vampire Prince. I suppose all influential men and women must start out as normal, unremarkable children.</p><p>\"For many centuries, the rulers of this world will keep the dragons in check,\" Evanna said. \"They'll control them. Later, when they lose their hold on power - as all rulers must - the dragons will fly free and multiply, becoming a real menace. In the end they'll outlive or outlast all the humans, vampires and vampaneze, and rule the world in their turn. I'm not sure what comes after them. I've never looked that far ahead.\"</p><p>\"Why doesn't it kill us?\" I asked, eyeing the dragon uneasily. \"Is it tame?\"</p><p>\"Hardly!\" Evanna laughed. \"Normally the dragons would tear us apart. Our father masks this area from them - they can't see the Lake of Souls or anyone around it.\"</p><p>\"This one sees us,\" I noted.</p><p>\"Yes, but you're controlling it, so we are safe.\"</p><p>\"The last time I was here, I was almost roasted alive by dragons,\" I said. \"How can I control them now when I couldn't before?\"</p><p>\"But you could,\" Evanna replied. \"You had the power - you just didn't know it. The dragons would have obeyed you then, as they do now.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" I frowned. \"What's so special about me?\"</p><p>\"You're Desmond Tiny's son,\" Evanna reminded me. \"Even though he did not pass on his magical powers to you, traces of his influence remain. That is why you were skilled at controlling animals such as spiders and wolves. But there is more to it than that.\"</p><p>Evanna reached out, her hand extending far beyond its natural length, and touched the dragon's head. Its skull glowed beneath the witch's touch. Its purple skin faded, then became translucent, so I could see inside to its brain. The oval, stone-like shape was instantly familiar, though it took me a few seconds to recall what it reminded me of. Then it clicked.</p><p>\"The Stone of Blood!\" I exclaimed. While this was much smaller than the one in the Hall of Princes, it was unmistakably the same type. The Stone of Blood had been a gift to the vampires from Mr Tiny. For seven hundred years the members of the clan had fed their blood to it, and used it to keep track of and communicate with each other. It was an invaluable tool, but dangerous - if it had fallen into the hands of the vampaneze, they could have tracked down and killed almost every living vampire.</p><p>\"Our father took the brain of a dragon into the past and gave it to the vampires,\" Evanna said. \"He often does that - travels into the past and makes small changes which influence the present and future. Through the Stone of Blood he bound the vampires more tightly to his will. If the vampires win the War of the Scars, they will use the Stone to control the dragons, and through them the skies. I don't think the vampaneze will use it if they win... They never trusted this gift of Desmond Tiny's - it was one of the reasons they broke away from the rest of the vampire clan. I'm not sure what their relationship with the dragons would be like. Perhaps our father will provide them with some other way of controlling the beasts - or maybe it will please him to let them be enemies.\"</p><p>\"The Stone of Blood was supposed to be the clan's last hope,\" I muttered, unable to take my eyes off the dragon's glowing brain. \"There was a legend - if we lost the war with the vampaneze, the Stone of Blood might some night help us rise again.\"</p><p>Evanna nodded and removed her hand from the dragon's head. It stopped glowing and resumed its normal appearance. The dragon didn't seem to have noticed any change. It continued staring at me, awaiting my command.</p><p>\"Above all else, our father craves chaos,\" Evanna said. \"Stability bores him. He has no interest in seeing any race rule for ever. For a time it pleased him to let humans rule this planet, since they were violent, always at war with one another. But when he saw them heading the way of peace during the latter half of the twentieth century - or thought he did; to be honest, I don't agree with his assessment - he set about overthrowing them. He will do the same with their successors.</p><p>\"If the vampaneze win the War of the Scars and wipe out the vampires, he'll use the Stone in the future. He will lead humans to it and teach them to extract the blood cells and build a new army of cloned vampires. But they won't be vampires as you know them. Desmond will control the cloning process and meddle with the cells, twisting and re-shaping them. The new creatures will be more savage than the original vampires, with less developed brains, slaves to the whim of our father.\" Evanna smiled twistedly. \"So yes, our father told the truth when he said the Stone of Blood could help the vampires rise again - but he kept a few of the less savoury facts to himself.\"</p><p>\"Then neither side can truly win,\" I said. \"He's just setting the victors up for a later fall.\"</p><p>\"That has always been Desmond's way,\" Evanna said. \"What he helps create, he later destroys. Many empires - Egyptian, Persian, British - have already learnt that to their cost.\"</p><p>\"Egyptian?\" I blinked.</p><p>\"Our father is a great fan of empires,\" Evanna said. \"Cavemen hitting each other with sticks and bones were of very limited interest to him. He prefers to see people killing each other with more effective weapons, and in greater numbers. But for mankind to advance barbarically, it also had to advance in other ways. It had to grow socially, culturally, spiritually, technologically, medically. Only a nation which was great in all aspects could wage war greatly.</p>","<p>\"Our father has had his hand in most of the notable architectural, technical or medical breakthroughs of mankind. He could never openly lead, but he influenced slyly. The only area where he had no real power was that of literature. Desmond is not a fictional dreamer. Reality is everything to him. He has no interest in the wonderful stories of mankind. Writers have always been alien to him - he does not read works of fiction, or take any notice of them.\"</p><p>\"Never mind that,\" I grunted, not giving a hoot about Mr Tiny's choice of reading material. \"Tell me more about his meddling with mankind, and time-travelling. You say Mr Tiny goes into the past to change the present and future. But what about the time paradox?\" I'd seen lots of science fiction movies and TV shows. I knew all about the problems associated with the theory of time travel.</p><p>\"There is no paradox,\" Evanna said. \"The universe keeps natural order. The key events of the past cannot be changed - only the people involved.\"</p><p>\"Huh?\" I said.</p><p>\"Once something important happens in the present - the universe, to give the higher force a name, decides what is important or not - it can never be changed,\" Evanna explained. \"But you can alter the people involved. For instance, now that it has happened, you cannot travel to the past and prevent World War Two - but you could go back and kill Adolf Hitler. The universe would immediately create another person to fill his shoes. That person would be born like any normal person, grow up, then do what Hitler did, with precisely the same results. The name would change, but nothing else.\"</p><p>\"But Hitler was a monster,\" I said. \"He murdered millions of people. Do you mean, if Mr Tiny went back and killed him, some innocent guy would take his place? All those people would still die?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Evanna said.</p><p>\"But then that person wouldn't have chosen their fate,\" I frowned. \"They wouldn't be responsible for their actions.\"</p><p>Evanna sniffed. \"The universe would have to create a child with the potential for wickedness - a good man cannot be forced to do evil - but once it did, yes, that person would become a victim of destiny. It does not happen often. Our father only occasionally replaces important figures of the past. Most people have free will. But there are a few who don't.\"</p><p>\"Am I one of them?\" I asked quietly, fearing the answer.</p><p>\"Most definitely not,\" Evanna smiled. \"Your time is the present time, and you are an original creation. Though you were manipulated by our father since birth, the path you trod had not been laid down by anyone before you.\"</p><p>Evanna thought for a few seconds, then tried to explain the situation in a way which I could more easily understand.</p><p>\"Although our father cannot change the events of the past, he can make minor alterations,\" she said. \"If something happens in the present which is not to his liking, he can return to the past and create a train of events designed to lead to a solution to whatever is troubling him. That's how vampires came to be so numerous and powerful.\"</p><p>\"Mr Tiny created vampires?\" I shouted - there was a myth that he'd made us, but I'd never believed it.</p><p>\"No,\" Evanna said. \"Vampires came into being by themselves. But there were never many of them. They were weak and disorganized. Then, in the middle of the twentieth century, our father decided mankind was taking a path towards peace and unity. Disliking it, he travelled to the past and spent a couple of decades trying different approaches to undermine humanity. In the end he settled on vampires. He gave them extra strength and speed, the power to flit and share their thoughts - all the supernatural abilities which you know about. He also provided them with leaders who would knock them into shape and turn them into an army.</p><p>\"As powerful as the clan became, our father ensured they couldn't be a threat to humans. Originally vampires were able to come out by day - Desmond Tiny made them prisoners of the night, and robbed them of the gift of childbirth. Carefully shackled and maintained this way, the vampires had to live separately to the world of man and remain in the shadows. Since they didn't change anything important in the human history, the universe let them exist, and they eventually become part of the present - which is when our father was free to use them however he wished.\"</p><p>\"And the present was my time?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Evanna said. \"Time passes at the same rate, whether our father is in the past, present or future. So, since he spent almost twenty years stuck in the past, trying to find a way to topple humanity, it was late in the twentieth century when he returned to the present.\"</p><p>\"And because vampires were now part of that present,\" I said, my brain hurting as I tried to keep up with all this mind-boggling information, \"they were free to influence the future?\"</p><p>\"Correct,\" Evanna said. \"But our father then saw that the clan wouldn't launch an attack on humanity if left to their own devices - they were content to stay out of the affairs of men. So he went back again - just for a few months this time - and engineered the vampaneze breakaway. By then planting the legend of the Lord of the Vampaneze, he edged them towards conflict with the vampires.\"</p><p>\"And that led to the War of the Scars, and eventually the downfall of humanity,\" I growled, sick at the thought of the little man's terrible slyness.</p><p>\"Well,\" Evanna smiled, \"that was the plan.\"</p><p>\"Do you mean-\" I began to say excitedly, sensing hope in her smile.</p><p>\"Hush,\" Evanna stopped me. \"I will reveal all shortly. But now it is time for us to move on.\" She pointed to where the sun was setting on the horizon. \"The nights are colder in this time than in yours. We will be safer underground. Besides,\" she said, rising, \"we have an appointment to keep.\"</p><p>\"With who?\" I asked.</p><p>She looked at me steadily. \"Our father.\"</p><p>Chapter FIFTEEN</p><p>Mr Tiny was the last person in the world - in all of time! - that I wanted to see. I argued with Evanna hotly, wanting to know why I should present myself to him, or what it could achieve. I hated and feared the meddler more than ever now that I knew so much about him.</p><p>\"I want to be on the opposite side of the world to wherever he is!\" I cried. \"Or in another universe, if possible!\"</p><p>\"I understand,\" Evanna said, \"but we must go to him regardless.\"</p><p>\"Is he forcing you to do this?\" I asked. \"Is he the one who ordered me fished out of the Lake? Is he making you take me to him, so that he can mess my life up all over again?\"</p>","<p>\"You will find out when you meet him,\" Evanna said coolly, and since I didn't really have any option but to follow her lead - she could have had me tossed back into the Lake if I disobeyed - eventually, and with much angry muttering, I reluctantly followed after her as she set off into the arid wilderness.</p><p>As we left the warmth of the fire, the dragon flapped its wings and took to the skies. I watched it join the throng of dragons far above me, then lost track of it. When I looked back at Evanna, I saw that she was still staring up at the sky. \"I wish we could have gone for a flight,\" she said, sounding curiously sad.</p><p>\"On the dragon?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Yes. It has always been a wish of mine to fly on a dragon.\"</p><p>\"I could call it back,\" I suggested.</p><p>She shook her head quickly. \"This isn't the time for it,\" she said. \"And there are too many of them. The others would see us on its back and attack. I don't think you would be able to control so many, not without more practice. And while I can mask us from them down here, I couldn't up there.\"</p><p>As we continued to walk, I looked around and backwards, and my gaze settled on the Little People standing motionless by the Lake. \"Why are that lot here?\" I asked.</p><p>\"This is the age in which our father fishes for the souls of the dead to create his Little People,\" Evanna said, without looking back or slowing. \"He could take them from any time, but it's easier this way, when there is nobody to interfere. He leaves a small band of his helpers here, to fish when he gives the order.\" She glanced at me. \"He could have rescued you much earlier. In the present, only two years have passed. He had the power to remove you from the Lake then, but he wanted to punish you. Your sacrifice threw his plans into disarray. He hates you for that, even though you are his son. That's why he sent me forward to this point in time to help you. In this future, your soul has suffered for countless generations. He wanted you to feel the pain of near-eternal imprisonment, and perhaps even go mad from it, so that you couldn't be saved.\"</p><p>\"Nice,\" I grunted sarcastically. Then my eyes narrowed. \"If that's the way he feels, why rescue me at all?\"</p><p>\"That will soon become clear,\" Evanna said.</p><p>We walked a long way from the Lake. The air was turning cold around us as the sun dipped. Evanna was looking for a specific spot, pausing every few seconds to examine the ground, then moving on. Finally she found what she was searching for. She came to a halt, knelt and breathed softly on the dusty earth. There was a rumbling sound, then the ground split at our feet and the mouth of a tunnel opened up. I could only see a few metres down it, but I sensed danger.</p><p>\"Don't tell me we have to go down there,\" I muttered.</p><p>\"This is the way to our father's stronghold,\" she said.</p><p>\"It's dark,\" I stalled.</p><p>\"I will provide light,\" she promised, and I saw that both her hands were glowing softly, casting a dim white light a few metres ahead of her. She looked at me seriously. \"Stay by my side down there. Don't stray.\"</p><p>\"Will Mr Tiny get me if I do?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Believe it or not, there are worse monsters than our father,\" she said. \"We will be passing some of them. If they get their hands on you, your millennia of torment in the Lake of Souls will seem like a pleasant hour spent on a beach.\"</p><p>I doubted that, but the threat was strong enough to ensure I kept within a hair's breadth of the witch as she started down the tunnel. It sloped at a fairly constant thirty-degree angle. The floor and walls were smooth and made of what looked like solid rock. But there were shapes moving within the rock, twisted, inhuman, elongated shapes, all shadows, claws, teeth and tendrils. The walls bulged outwards as we passed - the things trapped within were reaching for us. But none could break through.</p><p>\"What are they?\" I croaked, sweating from fear as much as the dry heat of the tunnel.</p><p>\"Creatures of universal chaos,\" Evanna answered. \"I told you about them before - they're the monsters I spoke of. They are kin to our father, though he is not as powerful as them. They are imprisoned by a series of temporal and spatial laws - the laws of the universe which our father and I live by. If we ever break the laws, these creatures will be freed. They will turn the universe into a hell of their own making. All will fall beneath them. They'll invade every time zone and torture every mortal being ever born - for ever.\"</p><p>\"That's why you were angry when you found out I was Mr Tiny's son,\" I said. \"You thought he'd broken the laws.\"</p><p>\"Yes. I was wrong, but it was a close-run thing. I doubt if even he was sure of his plan's success. When he gave birth to Hibernius and me, we knew of the laws, and we obeyed them. If he was wrong about you - if he'd given you more power than he meant to - you could have unknowingly broken the laws and brought about the ruin of everything we know and love.\" She looked back at me and grinned. \"I bet you never guessed you were that important to the world!\"</p><p>\"No,\" I said sickly. \"And I never wanted to be.\"</p><p>\"Don't worry,\" she said, her smile softening. \"You took yourself out of the firing line when you let Steve kill you. You did what Hibernius and I never thought possible - you changed what seemed an inevitable future.\"</p><p>\"You mean I prevented the coming of the Lord of the Shadows?\" I asked eagerly. \"That's why I let him kill me. It was the only way I could see to stop it. I didn't want to be a monster. I couldn't bear the thought of destroying the world. Mr Tiny said one of us had to be the Lord of the Shadows. But I thought, if both of us were dead...\"</p><p>\"You thought right,\" Evanna said. \"Our father had edged the world to a point where there were only two futures. When you killed Steve and sacrificed yourself, it opened up dozens of possible futures again. I could not have done it - I would have broken the laws if I'd interfered - but as a human, you were able to.\"</p><p>\"So what's happened since I died?\" I asked. \"You said two years have passed. Did the vampires defeat the vampaneze and win the War of the Scars?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Evanna said, pursing her lips. \"The war still rages. But an end is within sight - an end very much not to our father's liking. Persuasive leaders are pushing for peace, Vancha and Harkat Mulds on the side of the vampires, Gannen Harst for the vampaneze. They are debating a treaty, discussing the guidelines by which both sides can live as one. Others fight against them - there are many in both clans who do not wish for peace - but the voices of reason are winning out.\"</p>","<p>\"Then it worked!\" I gasped. \"If the vampires and vampaneze make peace, the world will be saved!\"</p><p>\"Perhaps,\" Evanna hummed. \"It's not as clear-cut as that. Under Steve, the vampaneze made contact with human political and military leaders. They promised them long lives and power in exchange for their help. They wanted to create nuclear and chemical warfare, with the aim of bringing the world and its survivors under their direct control. That could still happen.\"</p><p>\"Then we've got to stop it!\" I shouted. \"We can't let-\"</p><p>\"Easy,\" Evanna hushed me. \"We are trying to prevent it. That's why I am here. I cannot meddle too deeply in the affairs of mankind, but I can do more now than before, and your actions have convinced me that I should interfere. Hibernius and I always stayed neutral. We did not get involved in the affairs of mortals. Hibernius wished to, but I argued against it, afraid we might break the laws and free the monsters.\" She sighed. \"I was wrong. It's necessary to take risks every now and then. Our father took a risk in his attempt to wreak havoc - and I must now take one in an attempt to secure peace.\"</p><p>\"What are you talking about?\" I frowned.</p><p>\"Mankind has been evolving,\" she said. \"It has a destiny of its own, a growth towards something wonderful, which our father is intent on ruining. He used the vampires and vampaneze to throw mankind off course, to reduce the cities of the world to rubble, to drag humans back into the dark ages, so that he could control them again. But his plan failed. The clans of the night now seek to reunite and live separately from mankind, hidden, doing no harm, as they did in the past.</p><p>\"Because the vampires and vampaneze have become part of the present, our father cannot unmake them. He could return to the past and create another race to combat them, but that would be difficult and time-consuming. Time, for once, is against him. If he cannot divide the clans within the next year or so, it is unlikely that he will be able to bring about the downfall of mankind which he craved. He might - and no doubt will - plot afresh in the future, and seek some other way to break them, but for the time being the world will be safe.\"</p><p>Evanna paused. Her hands were directed towards her face, illuminating her features. I'd never seen her look so thoughtful. \"Do you remember the story of how I was created?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Of course,\" I said. \"A vampire - Corza Jarn - wanted vampires to be able to have children. He pursued Mr Tiny until he agreed to grant him his wish, and by mixing Corza Jarn's blood with a pregnant she-wolf, and using his magic on her, he fathered you and Mr Tall.\"</p><p>\"That was not his only reason for creating us,\" Evanna said, \"but it was an important one. I can bear a vampire or a vampaneze's children, and they in turn could have children of their own. But any children of mine will be different from their fathers. They will have some of my powers - not all - and they'll be able to live by day. Sunlight won't kill them.\"</p><p>She looked at me intently. \"A new breed of creature, an advanced race of vampire or vampaneze. If I gave birth to such children now, it would drive the clans apart. The warmongers of both sides would use the children to stir up new visions and violence. For instance, if I had a child by a vampire father, those vampires opposed to peace would hail the child as a saviour, and say he was sent to help them wipe out the vampaneze. Even if the wiser vampires prevailed, and talked down the troublemakers, the vampaneze would be afraid of the child and suspicious of the vampire clan's long-term plans. How could they discuss peace terms, knowing they were now inferior to vampires, for ever at risk?</p><p>\"The War of the Scars promises to end because both sides see that it might go on for ever. When the Lord of the Vampaneze and the vampire hunters were active, everybody knew the war would have a destined end. Now that Steve and you are dead, it might never finish, and neither vampires nor vampaneze want that. So they're willing to talk about peace.</p><p>\"But my children could change everything. With the renewed promise of victory - either for the vampires or vampaneze, depending on which I chose to be the fathers of my young - the war would continue. As my children grew - and they'd grow quickly, since they'd be creatures of a certain amount of magic - they'd be raised on hatred and fear. In time they'd become warriors and lead their clan to victory over the other - and our father's plan would fall back into place, a little later than anticipated, but otherwise intact.\"</p><p>\"Then you mustn't have them!\" I exclaimed. \"Mr Tiny can't make you, can he?\"</p><p>\"Not directly,\" she said. \"He has threatened and bribed me ever since the night you and Steve died. But he does not have the power to force me to give birth.\"</p><p>\"Then it's OK.\" I smiled weakly. \"You won't have any children, and that will be that.\"</p><p>\"Oh, but I will,\" Evanna said, and lowered her hands so that they shone on her stomach. \"In fact, I'm pregnant already.\"</p><p>\" What ?\" I exploded. \"But you just said-\"</p><p>\"I know.\"</p><p>\"But if you-\"</p><p>\"I know.\"</p><p>\"But-\"</p><p>\"Darren!\" she snapped. \"I. Know.\"</p><p>\"Then why do it?\" I cried.</p><p>Evanna stopped to explain. As soon as she paused, the shapes in the walls began to press closer towards us, hissing and snarling, claws and tendrils extending, stretching the fabric of the rock. Evanna spotted this and strode forward again, speaking as she walked.</p><p>\"I asked Desmond to free your spirit. Guilt drove you to the Lake of Souls, and would have kept you there eternally - there is no natural escape from that Lake of the damned. But rescue is possible. Souls can be fished out. Knowing that you were my half-brother, I felt honour-bound to free you.\"</p><p>\"What about Steve?\" I asked. \"He was your half-brother too.\"</p><p>\"Steve deserves his imprisonment.\" Her eyes were hard. \"I feel pity for him, since he was to some extent a victim of our father's meddling. But Steve's evil was primarily of his own making. He chose his path and now must suffer the consequences. But you tried to do good. It wasn't fair that you should rot in the Lake of Souls, so I pleaded with our father to help.\" She chuckled. \"Needless to say, he refused.</p><p>\"He came to me a few months ago,\" she continued. \"He realized his plans were unravelling and he saw me as his only solution. He'd spent most of the time since your death trying to convince me to have children, with no more success than I'd had trying to get him to free you. But this time he took a fresh approach. He said we could help each other. If I had a child, he'd free your soul.\"</p>","<p>\"You agreed to that?\" I roared. \"You sold out the world just to help me?\"</p><p>\"Of course not,\" she grunted.</p><p>\"But you said you were pregnant.\"</p><p>\"I am.\" She looked back at me and smiled shyly. \"My first thought was to reject our father's offer. But then I saw a way to use it to our advantage. There is still no guarantee of a peaceful settlement between the vampires and vampaneze. It looks promising but is by no means certain. If talks break down, the war could continue, and that would play into our father's hands. He would have time to go back to the past and create a new leader, one who could pick up where Steve left off.</p><p>\"I was thinking of this when Desmond put his suggestion to me. I recalled the way you tricked him, and wondered what you would do in my situation. Then, in a flash, I saw it.</p><p>\"I accepted his proposal but told him I wasn't sure whether I wanted a vampire's child or a vampaneze's. He said it didn't matter. I asked if I could choose. He said yes. So I spent some time with Gannen Harst, then with Vancha March. When I returned to our father, I told him I had chosen and was pregnant. He was so delighted, he didn't even complain when I refused to reveal who the father was - he just quickly arranged to send me here to free you, so that we could move forward without any further distractions.\"</p><p>She stopped talking and rubbed her stomach with her hands. She was still smiling that strange shy smile.</p><p>\"So whose is it?\" I asked. I didn't see what difference it made but I was curious to know the answer.</p><p>\"Both,\" she said. \"I am having twins - one by Vancha, one by Gannen.\"</p><p>\"A vampire child and a vampaneze child!\" I cried, excited.</p><p>\"More than that,\" Evanna said. \"I have allowed the three blood lines to mix. Each child is one third vampire, one third vampaneze, and one third me. That's how I've tricked him. He thought any baby of mine would divide the clans, but instead they will pull them closer together. My children, when they are ready, will breed with other vampires and vampaneze, to give birth to a new, multi-race clan. All divisions will be erased and finally forgotten.</p><p>\"We're going to create peace, Darren, in spite of our father. That's what you taught me - we don't have to accept destiny, or Des Tiny. We can create our own future, all of us. We have the power to rule our lives - we just have to make the choice to use it. You chose when you sacrificed your life. Now I've chosen too - by giving life. Only time will tell what our choices lead to, but I'm sure that whatever future we help usher in, it has to be better than the one our father planned.\"</p><p>\"Amen to that!\" I muttered, then followed her silently down the tunnel, thinking of the future and all the surprises and twists it might hold. My head was buzzing with thoughts and ideas. I was having to take on board so much, so quickly, that I felt overwhelmed by it all, not sure what to make of everything. But there was one thing I was absolutely sure of - when Mr Tiny found out about Evanna's babies, he'd all but explode with anger!</p><p>Thinking of that, and the nasty little meddler's face when he heard the news, I burst out laughing. Evanna laughed too, and the laughter stayed with us for ages, following us down the tunnel like a flock of chuckling birds, acting almost like a protective spell against the banks of walled-in, ever-moving, ever-reaching monsters.</p><p>Chapter SIXTEEN</p><p>About an hour later the tunnel ended and we entered the home of Desmond Tiny. I'd never really thought of him having a home. I just assumed he wandered the world, always on the move, in search of bloodshed and chaos. But, now that I considered it, I realized every monster needs a den to call its own, and Mr Tiny's had to be the strangest of them all.</p><p>It was a huge - and I mean HUGE - cave, maybe a couple of miles or so wide, and stretching as far ahead as I could make out. Much of the cave was natural, stalagmites and stalactites, waterfalls, beautifully weird rock colours and formations. But much more of it was incredibly un natural.</p><p>There were grand old cars from what I guessed must be the 1920s or 1930s floating in the air overhead. At first I thought they were attached to the ceiling by wires, but they were in constant motion, circling, crossing paths, even looping around like planes, and not a wire in sight.</p><p>There were mannequins all over the place, dressed in costumes from every century and continent, from a primitive loincloth to the most outrageous modern fashion accessories. Their blank eyes unsettled me - I got the feeling that they were watching me, ready to spring to life at Mr Tiny's command and leap upon me.</p><p>There were works of art and sculpture, some so famous that even an art cretin like me recognized them - the Mona Lisa, The Thinker, The Last Supper . Mixed in with them, displayed like art exhibits, were dozens of brains preserved in glass cases. I read a few of the labels - Beethoven, Mozart, Wagner, Mahler. (That one gave me a jump - I'd gone to a school named after Mahler!)</p><p>\"Our father loves music,\" Evanna whispered. \"Where humans collect sheet music or gramophone records-\" She obviously hadn't heard about CDs yet! \" -he collects brains of composers. By touching them, he can listen to all the tunes they ever composed, along with many they never completed or shared with the world.\"</p><p>\"But where does he get them from?\" I asked.</p><p>\"He travels to the past when they have just died and robs their graves,\" she said, as though it was the most casual thing in the world. I thought about questioning the right and wrong of something like that, but there were weightier issues to deal with, so I let it slide.</p><p>\"He likes art too, I take it,\" I said, nodding at a flowery Van Gogh.</p><p>\"Immensely,\" Evanna said. \"These are all originals of course - he doesn't bother with copies.\"</p><p>\"Nonsense!\" I snorted. \"These can't be real. I've seen some of the real paintings. Mum and Dad-\" I still thought of my human Dad as my real father, and always would. \" -took me to see the Mona Lisa in the Loo once.\"</p><p>\"The Louvre,\" Evanna corrected me. \"That is a copy. Some of our father's Little People are created from the souls of artists. They make perfect copies of pieces he especially admires. Then he slips back to the past and swaps the copy for the original. In most cases even the actual artist cannot tell the difference.\"</p><p>\"You're telling me the Mona Lisa in Paris is a fake?\" I asked sceptically.</p><p>\"Yes.\" Evanna laughed at my expression. \"Our father is a selfish man. He always keeps the best for himself. What he wants, he takes - and he normally wants the best of everything. Except books.\" Her voice became pointed, as it had earlier when she'd been talking about his attitude towards books. \"Desmond never reads works of fiction. He doesn't collect books or pay any attention to authors. Homer, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Dickens, Tolstoy, Twain - all have passed him by unmarked. He doesn't care what they have to say. He has nothing to do with the world of literature. It's as if it exists in a separate universe from his.\"</p>","<p>Once again I didn't see her point in telling me this, so I let my interest wander. I'd never been a big art fan, but even I was impressed by this display. It was the ultimate collection, capturing a slice of pretty much all the artistic wonder and imagination mankind had ever conjured into being.</p><p>There was far too much for any one person to take in. Weapons, jewellery, toys, tools, albums of stamps, bottles of vintage wine, Faberg&eacute; eggs, grandfather clocks, suites of furniture, thrones of kings and queens. A lot of it was precious, but there were plenty of worthless items too, stuff which had simply caught Mr Tiny's fancy, such as bottle tops, oddly shaped balloons, digital watches, a collection of empty ice-cream tubs, thousands of whistles, hundreds of thousands of coins (old ones mixed in with brand new ones), and so on. The treasure cave in Aladdin seemed like a bargain bin in comparison.</p><p>Even though the cave was packed with all manner of wonders and oddities, it didn't feel cluttered. There was plenty of space to walk about and explore. We wound our way through the various collections and artefacts, Evanna pausing occasionally to point out a particularly interesting piece - the charred stake on which Joan Of Arc was burnt, the pistol which had been used to shoot Lincoln, the very first wheel.</p><p>\"Historians would go crazy in this place,\" I noted. \"Does Mr Tiny ever bring anybody here?\"</p><p>\"Almost never,\" Evanna said. \"This is his private sanctuary. I've only been here a handful of times myself. The exceptions are those he pulls out of the Lake of Souls. He has to bring them here to turn them into Little People.\"</p><p>I stopped when she said that. I'd had a sudden premonition. \"Evanna...\" I began, but she shook her head.</p><p>\"Ask no more questions,\" she said. \"Desmond will explain the rest to you. It won't be long now.\"</p><p>Minutes later we reached what felt like the centre of the cave. There was a small pool of green liquid, a pile of blue robes and, standing beside them, Mr Tiny. He was staring at me sourly through the lenses of his thick glasses.</p><p>\"Well, well,\" he drawled, hooking his thumbs behind his braces. \"If it isn't the young martyr himself. Meet anyone interesting in the Lake of Souls?\"</p><p>\"Ignore him,\" Evanna said out of the side of her mouth.</p><p>Mr Tiny waddled forward and stopped a few metres shy of me. His eyes seemed to dance with fire this close up. \"If I'd known what a nuisance you were going to be, I'd never have spawned you,\" he hissed.</p><p>\"Too late now,\" I jeered.</p><p>\"No it isn't,\" he said. \"I could go back and erase you from the past, make it so you never lived. The universe would replace you. Somebody else would become the youngest ever Vampire Prince, hunt for the Vampaneze Lord, etc. - but you would never have existed. Your soul wouldn't just be destroyed - it would be unmade completely.\"</p><p>\"Father,\" Evanna said warningly, \"you know you aren't going to do that.\"</p><p>\"But I could!\" Mr Tiny insisted.</p><p>\"Yes,\" she tutted, \"but you won't. We have an agreement. I've upheld my end. Now it's your turn.\"</p><p>Mr Tiny muttered something unpleasant, then forced a fake smile. \"Very well. I'm a man of my word. Let's get on with it. Darren, my woebegotten boy, get rid of that blanket and hop into the pool.\" He nodded at the green liquid.</p><p>\"Why?\" I asked stiffly.</p><p>\"It's time to recast you.\"</p><p>A few minutes earlier, I wouldn't have known what he was talking about. But Evanna's hint had prepared me for this. \"You want to turn me into a Little Person, don't you?\" I said.</p><p>Mr Tiny's lips twitched. He glared at Evanna, but she shrugged innocently. \"A right little know-it-all, aren't you?\" he huffed, disgusted that I'd ruined his big surprise.</p><p>\"How does it work?\" I asked.</p><p>Mr Tiny crossed to the pool and crouched beside it. \"This is the soup of creation,\" he said, running a finger through the thick green liquid. \"It will become your blood, the fuel on which your new body runs. Your bones will be stripped bare when you step in. Your flesh, brain, organs and soul will dissolve. I shall mix the lot up and build a new body out of the mess.\" He grinned. \"Those who've been through it tell me it's a most frightfully painful procedure, the worst they've ever known.\"</p><p>\"What makes you think I'm going to do it?\" I asked tightly. \"I've seen how your Little People live, mindless, speechless, unable to remember their original identities, slaves to your whims, eating the flesh of dead animals - even humans! Why should I place myself under your spell like that?\"</p><p>\"No deal with my daughter if you don't,\" Mr Tiny said simply.</p><p>I shook my head stubbornly. I knew Evanna was trying to out-fox Mr Tiny, but I didn't see why this was necessary. How could I help bring about peace between the vampires and vampaneze by going through a load of pain and becoming a Little Person? It didn't make sense.</p><p>As if reading my thoughts, Evanna said softly, \"This is for you, Darren. It has nothing to do with what is happening in the present, or the War of the Scars. This is your only hope of escaping the pull of the Lake of Souls and going to Paradise. You can live a full life as you are, in this waste world, and return to the Lake when you die. Or you can trust us and place yourself in our fathers hands.\"</p><p>\"I trust you,\" I said to Evanna, shooting an arch look at Mr Tiny.</p><p>\"Oh, my boy, if you only knew how much that hurts,\" Mr Tiny said miserably, then laughed. \"Enough of the dawdling. You either do this or you don't. But take heed, daughter - by making the offer, I've fulfilled my end of the bargain. If the boy refuses to accept your advice, on his head be it. I'll expect you to keep your word.\"</p><p>Evanna looked at me questioningly, not placing any pressure on me. I thought about it at length. I hated the idea of becoming a Little Person. It wasn't so much the pain as letting Mr Tiny become my master. And what if Evanna was lying? I'd said I trusted the witch, but thinking back, I realized there was precious little reason to trust her. She'd never betrayed her father before, or worked for the good of any individual. Why start now? What if this was a twisted scheme to ensnare me, and she was in league with Mr Tiny, or had been tricked into doing his bidding? The whole thing stank of a trap.</p><p>But what other option had I? Give Evanna the cold shoulder, refuse to enter the pool, walk away? Even assuming Mr Tiny let me leave, and the monsters in the tunnel didn't catch me, what would I have to look forward to? A life lived in a world full of dragons, followed by eternity in the Lake of Souls, wasn't my idea of a good time! In the end I decided it was better to gamble and hope for the best.</p>","<p>\"OK,\" I said reluctantly. \"But there's one condition.\"</p><p>\"You're in no position to set conditions,\" Mr Tiny growled.</p><p>\"Maybe not,\" I agreed, \"but I'm setting one anyway. I'll only do it if you guarantee me a free memory. I don't want to wind up like Harkat, not knowing who I was, obeying your orders because I've no free will of my own. I'm not sure what you have planned for me once I become a Little Person, but if it involves serving as one of your fog-brained slaves...\"</p><p>\"It doesn't,\" Mr Tiny interrupted. \"I admit I quite like the idea of having you toady to me for a few million years or so, but my daughter was very precise when it came to the terms of our agreement. You won't be able to talk but that's the only restriction.\"</p><p>\"Why won't I be able to talk?\" I frowned.</p><p>\"Because I'm sick of listening to you!\" Mr Tiny barked. \"Besides, you won't need to speak. Most of my Little People don't. Muteness hasn't harmed any of the others, and it won't harm you.\"</p><p>\"OK,\" I muttered. I didn't like it, but I could see there was no point arguing. Stepping up to the edge of the pool, I shrugged off the blanket which the Little People had draped around me shortly after I emerged from the Lake of Souls. I stared into the dark green liquid. I couldn't see my reflection in it. \"What-\" I started to ask.</p><p>\"No time for questions!\" Mr Tiny barked and nudged me hard with an elbow. I teetered on the edge of the pool a moment, arms flailing, then splashed heavily into what felt like the sizzling fires of hell.</p><p>Chapter SEVENTEEN</p><p>Instant agony and burning. My flesh bubbled, then boiled away. I tried to scream but my lips and tongue had already come undone. My eyes and ears melted. No sensation except pain.</p><p>The liquid stripped my flesh from my bones, then set to work on the marrow within the bones. Next it burnt through to my inner organs, then ate me up from the inside out. Inside my head my brain sizzled like a knob of butter in a heated frying pan, and melted down just as quickly. My left arm - just bone now - tore loose from my body and floated away. It was soon followed by my lower right leg. Then I came apart completely, limbs, charred organs, tiny strips of flesh, bare pieces of bone. All that stayed constant was the pain, which hadn't lessened in the slightest.</p><p>In the midst of my suffering came a moment of spiritual calm. With whatever remained of my brain, I became aware of a separation. There was another presence in the pool with me. At first I was confused, but then I realized it was the flicker of Sam Grest's soul which I'd carried within me since drinking his blood at the time of his death. Sam had passed on to Paradise many years ago, and now this final shard of his spirit was departing this world too. In my mind's eye a face formed in the liquid, young and carefree, smiling in spite of the torment, popping a pickled onion into his mouth. Sam winked at me. A ghostly hand saluted. Then he was gone and I was finally, totally alone.</p><p>Eventually the pain ceased. I'd dissolved completely. There were no pain sensors left to transmit feelings, and no brain cells to respond to them. A weird peace descended. I'd become one with the pool. My atoms had mixed with the liquid and the two were now one. I was the green liquid. I could sense the hollow bones from my body drifting to the bottom of the pool, where they settled.</p><p>Some time later hands - Mr Tiny's - were dunked in the liquid. He wiggled his fingers and a shiver ran up the memory of my spine. He picked up the bones from the floor - being careful to scrape up every single piece - and dumped them on the ground of the cave. The bones were covered in molecules of the liquid - molecules of me - and through them I felt Mr Tiny putting the bones together, snapping them into small pieces, melting some down, bending or twisting others, creating a frame entirely different to my previous form.</p><p>Mr Tiny worked on the body for hours. When he had all the bones in place, he packed them full with organs - brain, heart, liver, kidneys - then covered them with clammy grey flesh, which he stitched together to hold the organs and bones in place. I'm not sure where the organs and flesh came from. Perhaps he grew them himself, but I think it more likely that he harvested them from other creatures - probably dead humans.</p><p>Mr Tiny finished with the eyes. I could feel him connecting the orbs up to my brain, fingers working at lightning-fast speed, with all the precision of the world's greatest surgeon. It was an incredibly artistic undertaking, one which even Dr Frankenstein would have struggled to match.</p><p>Once he'd finished with the body, he stuck his fingers back into the liquid of the pool. The fingers were cold this time, and grew colder by the second. The liquid began to condense, becoming thicker. There was no pain. It was just strange, like I was squeezing in upon myself.</p><p>Then, when the liquid was a fraction of the size it had been, with the texture of a thick milk shake, Mr Tiny removed his hands and tubes were inserted. There was a brief pause, then suction from the tubes, and I felt myself flowing through them, out of the pool and into... what?... not tubes like those which had been stuck into the pool, but similar...</p><p>Of course - veins ! Mr Tiny had told me the liquid would serve as my fuel - my blood. I was leaving the confines of the pool for the fleshy limits of my new body.</p><p>I felt myself fill the gaps, forcing my way through the network of veins and arteries, making slow but sure progress.</p><p>When the liquid hit the brain and gradually seeped into it, absorbed by the cold grey cells, my bodily senses awoke. I became aware of my heartbeat first, slower and heavier than before. A tingle ran through my hands and feet, then up my newly crafted spine. I twitched my fingers and toes. Moved an arm slightly. Shook a leg softly. The limbs didn't respond as quickly as my old limbs had, but maybe that was just because I wasn't used to them yet.</p><p>Sound came next, a harsh roaring noise at first, which gradually died away to allow normal sounds through. But the sounds weren't as sharp as before -like all the Little People, my ears had been stitched within the skin of my head. Hearing was soon followed by a dim sense of vision - but no smell or sense or taste, since - again, in common with all of Mr Tiny's creations - I'd been created without a nose.</p><p>My vision improved as more and more blood was transferred to my new brain. The world looked different through these eyes. I had a wider field of view than before, since my eyes were rounder and bigger. I could see more, but through a slightly green haze, as though staring through a filter.</p>","<p>The first sight I fixed on was Mr Tiny, still working on my body, monitoring the tubes, applying a few final stitches, testing my reflexes. He had the look of a loving, devoted parent.</p><p>Next I saw Evanna, keeping a close eye on her father, making sure he didn't pull any tricks. She handed him needles and string from time to time, like a nurse. Her expression was a mixture of suspicion and pride. Evanna knew all of Mr Tiny's shortcomings, but she was still his daughter, and I could see now that despite her misgivings she loved him - in a way.</p><p>Eventually the transfer was complete. Mr Tiny removed the tubes - they'd been stuck in all over, my arms, legs, torso, head - and sealed the holes, stitching them shut. He gave me a final once-over, fixed a spot where I was leaking, did some fine-tuning at the corners of my eyes, checked my heartbeat. Then he stepped back and grunted. \"Another perfect creation, even if I do say so myself.\"</p><p>\"Sit up, Darren,\" Evanna said. \"But slowly. Don't rush.\"</p><p>I did as she said. A wave of dizziness swept over me when I raised my head, but it soon passed. I pushed up gradually, pausing every time I felt dizzy or sick. Finally I was sitting upright. I was able to study my body from here, its broad hands and feet, thick limbs, dull grey skin. I noted that, like Harkat, I was neither fully male nor female, but something in between. If I could have blushed, I would have!</p><p>\"Stand,\" Mr Tiny said, spitting on his hands and rubbing them together, using his spit to wash himself. \"Walk about. Test yourself. It won't take you long to get used to your new shape. I design my Little People to go into immediate action.\"</p><p>With Evanna's help I stood. I weaved unsteadily on my feet, but soon found my balance. I was much stouter and heavier than before. As I'd noticed when lying down, my limbs didn't react as quickly as they once did. I had to focus hard to make my fingers curl or to edge a foot forward.</p><p>\"Easy,\" Evanna said as I tried to turn and almost fell back into the now empty pool. She caught and held me until I was steady again. \"Slowly, one bit at a time. It won't take long - just five or ten minutes.\" I tried to ask a question but no sound came out. \"You cannot speak,\" Evanna reminded me. \"You do not have a tongue.\"</p><p>I slowly raised a chunky grey arm and pointed a finger at my head. I stared at Evanna with my large green eyes, trying to transmit my question mentally. \"You want to know if we can communicate telepathically,\" Evanna said. I nodded my neck-less head. \"No. You have not been designed with that ability.\"</p><p>\"You're a basic model,\" Mr Tiny chipped in. \"You won't be around very long, so it would have been pointless to kit you out with a bunch of unnecessary features. You can think and move, which is all you need to do.\"</p><p>I spent the next several minutes getting to know my new body. There were no mirrors nearby, but I spotted a large silver tray in which I could study my reflection. Hobbling over to it, I ran a critical green eye over myself. I was maybe four and a half feet tall and three feet wide. My stitches weren't as neat as Harkat's, and my eyes weren't exactly level, but otherwise we didn't look too different. When I opened my mouth I saw that not only did I lack a tongue, but teeth too. I turned carefully and looked at Evanna, pointing to my gums.</p><p>\"You will not have to eat,\" she said.</p><p>\"You won't be alive long enough to bother with food,\" Mr Tiny added.</p><p>My new stomach clenched when he said that. I'd been tricked! It had been a trap, and I'd fallen for it! If I could have spoken, I'd have cursed myself for being such a fool.</p><p>But then, as I looked for a decent weapon to defend myself with, Evanna smiled positively. \"Remember why we did this, Darren - to free your soul. We could have given you a new, full life as a Little Person, but that would have complicated matters. It's easier this way. You have to trust us.\"</p><p>I didn't feel very trusting, but the deed was done. And Evanna didn't look like somebody who'd been tricked, or who was gloating from having tricked me. Putting fears of betrayal and thoughts of fighting aside, I decided to stay calm and see what the pair planned next for me.</p><p>Evanna picked up the pile of blue robes which had been lying near to the pool and came over with them. \"I prepared these for you earlier,\" she said, \"Let me help you put them on.\" I was going to signal that I could dress myself, but Evanna flashed me a look which made me stop. Her back was to Mr Tiny, who was examining the remains of the pool. While his attention was diverted, she slipped the robes on over my head and arms. I realized there were several objects inside the robes, stitched into the lining.</p><p>Evanna locked gazes with me and a secret understanding passed between us - she was telling me to act as if the objects weren't there. She was up to something which she didn't want Mr Tiny to know about. I'd no idea what she might have hidden in the robes, but it must be important. Once the robes were on I kept my arms out by my sides and tried not to think about the secret packages I was carrying, in case I accidentally tipped off Mr Tiny.</p><p>Evanna gave me a final once-over, then called out, \"He is ready, father.\"</p><p>Mr Tiny waddled across. He looked me up and down, sniffed snootily, then thrust a small mask at me. \"You'd better put that on,\" he said. \"You probably won't need it, but we might as well be safe as sorry.\"</p><p>As I strapped on the mask, Mr Tiny bent and drew a line in the earth of the cave floor. He stepped back from it and clutched his heart-shaped watch. The timepiece began to glow, and soon his hand and face were glowing too. Moments later a doorway grew out of the line in the ground, sliding upwards to its full height. It was an open doorway. The space between the jambs was a grey sheen. I'd been through a portal like this before, when Mr Tiny had sent Harkat and me into what would have been the future (what still might be, if Evanna's plan failed).</p><p>When the doorway was complete, Mr Tiny nodded his head at it. \"Time to go.\"</p><p>My eyes flicked to Evanna - was she coming with me? \"No,\" she said in answer to my unasked question. \"I will return to the present through a separate door. This one goes further back.\" She stooped so we were at the same height. \"This is goodbye, Darren. I don't imagine I'll ever make the journey to Paradise - I don't think it's intended for the likes of me - so we'll probably never see each other again.\"</p><p>\"Maybe he won't go to Paradise either,\" Mr Tiny sneered. \"Perhaps his soul is meant for the great fires beneath.\"</p>","<p>Evanna smiled. \"We don't know all the secrets of the beyond, but we've never seen any evidence of a hell. The Lake of Souls seems to be the only place where the damned end up, and if our plan works, you won't go back there. Don't worry - your soul will fly free.\"</p><p>\"Come on,\" Mr Tiny snapped. \"I'm bored with him. Time to kick him out of our lives, once and for all.\" He pushed Evanna aside, grabbed the shoulder of my robes and hauled me to the doorway. \"Don't get any smart ideas back there,\" he growled. \"You can't change the past, so don't go trying. Just do what you have to - tough luck if you can't work out what that is - and let the universe take care of the rest.\"</p><p>I turned my face towards him, not sure what he meant, wanting more answers. But Mr Tiny ignored me, raised a wellington-clad foot, then - without a word of farewell, as though I was a stranger who meant nothing to him - booted me clean through the door and back to a date with history.</p><p>Chapter EIGHTEEN</p><p>\"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Cirque Du Freak, home of the world's most remarkable human beings.\"</p><p>I had no eyelids, so I couldn't blink, but beneath my mask my jaw dropped a hundred miles. I was in the wings of a large theatre, staring out at a stage and the unmistakable figure of the dead Hibernius Tall. Except he wasn't dead. He was very much alive, and in the middle of introducing one of the fabled Cirque Du Freak performances.</p><p>\"We present acts both frightening and bizarre, acts you can find nowhere else in the world. Those who are easily scared should leave now. I'm sure there are people who...\"</p><p>Two beautiful women stepped up next to me and prepared to go on. They were tugging at their glittering costumes, making sure they fit right. I recognized the women - Davina and Shirley. They'd been part of the Cirque Du Freak when I first joined, but had left after a few years to get jobs in the ordinary world. The life of a travelling performer wasn't for everyone.</p><p>\"... is unique. And none are harmless,\" Mr Tall finished, then walked off. Davina and Shirley moved forward and I saw where they were heading - the Wolf Man's cage, which stood uncovered in the middle of the stage. As they left, a Little Person took his place by my side. His face was hidden beneath the hood of his blue robes, but his head turned in my direction. There was a moment's pause, then he reached up and pulled my hood further over my face, so that my features were hidden too.</p><p>Mr Tall appeared by our side with the speed and silence for which he was once renowned. Without a word he handed each of us a needle and lots of orange string. The other Little Person stuck the needle and string inside his robes, so I did the same, not wanting to appear out of place.</p><p>Davina and Shirley had released the Wolf Man from his cage and were walking through the audience with him, letting people stroke the hairy man-beast. I studied the theatre more closely while they paraded the Wolf Man around. This was the old abandoned cinema theatre in my home town, where Steve had murdered Shancus, and where - many years earlier - I had first crossed paths with Mr Crepsley.</p><p>I was wondering why I'd been sent back here - I had a pretty good hunch - when there was a loud explosion. The Wolf Man went wild, as he often did at the start of an act - what looked like a mad outburst was actually carefully staged. Leaping upon a screaming woman, he bit one of her hands off. In a flash, Mr Tall had left our side and reappeared next to the Wolf Man. He pulled him off the screaming woman, subdued him, then led him back to his cage, while Davina and Shirley did their best to calm down the crowd.</p><p>Mr Tall returned to the screaming woman, picked up her severed hand and whistled loudly. That was the signal for my fellow Little Person and me to advance. We ran over to Mr Tall, careful not to reveal our faces. Mr Tall sat the woman up and whispered to her. When she was quiet he sprinkled a sparkly pink powder on to her bleeding wrist and stuck the hand against it. He nodded to my companion and me. We pulled out our needles and string and started to stitch the hand back on to the wrist.</p><p>I felt light-headed while I stitched. This was the greatest sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu I'd ever experienced! I knew what was coming next, every second of it. I'd been sent back into my past, to a night which had been etched unforgettably into my memory. All the times I'd prayed for the chance to come back and change the course of my future. And now, in the most unexpected of circumstances, here it was.</p><p>We finished stitching and returned backstage. I wanted to stand in the shadows again and watch the show - if I remembered correctly, Alexander Ribs would come on next, followed by Rhamus Twobellies - but my fellow Little Person was having none of it. He nudged me ahead of him, to the rear of the theatre, where a young Jekkus Flang was waiting. In later years Jekkus would become an accomplished knife-thrower, and even take part in the shows. But in this time he'd only recently joined the circus, and was in charge of preparing the interval gift trays.</p><p>Jekkus handed each of us a tray packed with items such as rubber dolls of Alexander Ribs, clippings of the Wolf Man's hair, and chocolate nuts and bolts. He also gave us price tags for each item. He didn't speak to us - this was back in the time before Harkat Mulds, when everyone thought Little People were mute, mindless robots.</p><p>When Rhamus Twobellies stomped offstage, Jekkus sent us out into the audience to sell the gifts. We moved among the crowd, letting people study our wares and buy if they wished. My fellow Little Person took charge of the rear areas of the theatre, leaving me to handle the front rows. And so, a few minutes later, as I'd come to suspect I would, I came face to face with two young boys, the only children in the entire theatre. One was a wild child, the sort of kid who stole money from his mother and collected horror comics, who dreamt of being a vampire when he grew up. The other was a quiet, but in his own way equally mischievous boy, the kind who wouldn't think twice about stealing a vampire's spider.</p><p>\"How much is the glass statue?\" the impossibly young and innocent Steve Leopard asked, pointing to a statue on my tray which you could eat. Shakily, fighting to keep my hand steady, I showed him the price tag. \"I can't read,\" Steve said. \"Will you tell me how much it costs?\"</p><p>I noted the look of surprise on Darren's - Charna's guts! - on my face. Steve had guessed straightaway that there was something strange about the Little People, but I hadn't been so sharp. The young me had no idea why Steve was lying.</p><p>I shook my head quickly and moved on, leaving Steve to explain to my younger self why he'd pretended he couldn't read. If I'd been feeling light-headed earlier, I felt positively empty-headed now. It's a remarkable, earth-shattering thing to look into the eyes of a youthful you, to see yourself as you once were, young, foolish, gullible. I don't think anyone ever remembers what they were really like as kids. Adults think they do, but they don't. Photos and videos don't capture the real you, or bring back to life the person you used to be. You have to return to the past to do that.</p>","<p>We finished selling our wares and headed backstage to collect fresh trays full of new items, based on the next set of performers - Truska, Hans Hands, and then, appearing like a phantom out of the shadows of the night, Mr Crepsley and his performing tarantula, Madam Octa.</p><p>I couldn't miss Mr Crepsley's act. When Jekkus wasn't looking I crept forward and watched from the wings. My heart leapt into my mouth when my old friend and mentor walked on to the stage, startling in his red cloak with his white skin, orange crop of hair and trademark scar. Seeing him again, I wanted to rush out and throw my arms around him, tell him how much I missed him and how much he'd meant to me. I wanted to say that I loved him, that he'd been a second father to me. I wanted to joke with him about his stiff manner, his stunted sense of humour, his overly precious pride. I wanted to tell him how Steve had tricked him, and gently wind him up for being taken in by the pretence and dying for no reason. I was sure he'd see the funny side of it once he stopped steaming!</p><p>But there could be no communication between us. Even if I'd had a tongue, Mr Crepsley wouldn't have known who I was. On this night he hadn't yet met the boy named Darren Shan. I was nobody to him.</p><p>So I stood where I was and watched. One final turn from at the vampire who'd altered my life in so many ways. One last performance to savour, as he put Madam Octa through her paces and thrilled the crowd. I shivered when he first spoke - Id forgotten how deep his voice was - then hung on his every word. The minutes passed slowly, but not slowly enough for me - I wanted it to last an age.</p><p>A Little Person led a goat on stage for Madam Octa to kill. It wasn't the Little Person who'd been with me in the audience - there were more than two of us here. Madam Octa killed the goat, then performed a series of tricks with Mr Crepsley, crawled over his body and face, pulsed in and out of his mouth, played with tiny cups and saucers. In the crowd, the young Darren Shan was falling in love with the spider - he thought she was amazing. In the wings, the older Darren regarded her sadly. I used to hate Madam Octa - I could trace all my troubles back to the eight-legged beast - but not any longer. None of it was her fault. It was destiny. All along, from the first moment of my being, it had been Des Tiny.</p><p>Mr Crepsley concluded his act and left the stage. He had to pass me to get off. As he approached, I thought again about trying to communicate with him. I wasn't able to speak, but I could write. If I grabbed him and took him aside, scribbled a message, warned him to leave immediately, to get out now...</p><p>He passed.</p><p>I did nothing.</p><p>This wasn't the way. Mr Crepsley had no reason to trust me, and explaining the situation would have taken too much time - he was illiterate, so I'd have had to get somebody to read the note for him. It might also have been dangerous. If I'd told him about the Vampaneze Lord and all the rest, he might have tried to change the course of the future, to prevent the War of the Scars. Evanna had said it was impossible to change the past, but if Mr Crepsley - prompted by my warning - somehow managed to do so, he might free those terrible monsters which even Mr Tiny was afraid of. I couldn't take that risk.</p><p>\"What are you doing here?\" someone snapped behind me. It was Jekkus Flang. He poked me hard with a finger and pointed to my tray. \"Get out there quick!\" he growled.</p><p>I did as Jekkus ordered. I wanted to follow the same route as before, so that I could study myself and Steve again, but this time the other Little Person got there before me, so I had to trudge to the rear of the theatre and do the rounds there.</p><p>At the end of the interval Gertha Teeth took to the stage, to be followed by Sive and Seersa (the Twisting Twins) and finally Evra and his snake. I retreated to the rear of the theatre, not keen on the idea of seeing Evra again. Although the snake-boy was one of my best friends, I couldn't forget the pain I'd put him through. It would have hurt too much to watch him perform, thinking about the agony and loss he was to later endure.</p><p>While the final trio of acts brought the show to a close, I turned my attention to the objects stitched into the lining of my robes. Time to find out what Evanna had sent me back with. Reaching underneath the heavy blue cloth, I found the first of the rectangular items and ripped it loose. When I saw what it was, I broke out into a wide toothless smile.</p><p>The sly old witch! I recalled what she'd told me on the way from the Lake of Souls to Mr Tiny's cave - although the past couldn't be changed, the people involved in major events could be replaced. Sending me back to this period in time was enough to free my soul, but Evanna had gone one step further, and made sure I was able to free my old self too. Mr Tiny knew about that. He didn't like it, but he'd accepted it.</p><p>However, working on the sly, unknown to her father, Evanna had presented me with something even more precious than personal freedom - something that would drive Des Tiny absolutely cuckoo when he found out how he'd been swindled!</p><p>I pulled all the other objects out, set them in order, then checked the most recent addition. I didn't find what I expected, but as I scanned through it, I saw what Evanna had done. I was tempted to flick to the rear and read the last few words, but then decided I'd be better off not knowing.</p><p>I heard screams from within the theatre - Evra's snake must have made its first appearance of the night. I didn't have much time left. I slipped away before Jekkus Flang sought me out and burdened me with another tray. Exiting by the back door, I sneaked around and re-entered the cinema at the front. I walked down the long corridor to where an open door led to a staircase - the way up to the balcony.</p><p>I climbed a few steps, then set Evanna's gift down and waited. I thought about what to do with the objects - the weapons . Give them to the boy directly? No. If I did, he might use them to try to change the future. That wasn't allowed. But there must be a way to get them to him later, so that he could use them at the right time. Evanna wouldn't have given them to me if there wasn't.</p><p>It didn't take me long to figure it out. I was happier when I knew what to do with the gift, because it also meant I knew exactly what to do with young Darren.</p><p>The show ended and the audience members poured out of the theatre, eagerly discussing the show and marvelling aloud. Since the boys had been sitting near the front, they were two of the last to leave. I waited in silence, safe in the knowledge of what was to come.</p><p>Finally, a frightened young Darren opened the door to the stairway, slipped through, closed it behind him, and stood in the darkness, breathing heavily, heart pounding, waiting for everyone to file out of the theatre. I could see him in spite of the gloom - my large green eyes were almost as strong as a half-vampire's - but he had no idea I was there.</p>","<p>When the last sounds had faded, the boy came sloping up the stairs. He was heading for the balcony, to keep an eye on his friend Steve and see that he came to no harm. If he made it up there, his fate would be sealed and he'd have to live the tormented life of a half-vampire. I had the power to change that. This, in addition to freedom from the Lake of Souls, was Evanna's gift to me - and the last part of the gift as far as Mr Tiny was aware.</p><p>As young Darren drew close, I launched myself at him, picked him up before he knew what was happening, and ran with him down the stairs. I burst through the door into the light of the corridor, then dumped him roughly on the floor. His face was a mask of terror.</p><p>\"D-d-d-don't kill me!\" he squealed, scrabbling backwards.</p><p>In answer I tore my hood back, then ripped off my mask, revealing my round, grey, stitched together face and huge gaping maw of a mouth. I thrust my head forward, leered and spread my arms. Darren screamed, lurched to his feet and stumbled for the exit. I pounded after him, making lots of noise, scraping the wall with my fingers. He flew out of the theatre when he got to the door, rolled down the steps, then picked himself up and ran for his life.</p><p>I stood on the front door step, watching my younger self flee for safety. I was smiling softly. I'd stand guard here to be certain, but I was sure he wouldn't return. He'd run straight home, leap beneath the bed covers and shiver himself to sleep. In the morning, not having seen what Steve got up to, he'd phone to find out if his friend was OK. Not knowing who Mr Crepsley was, he'd have no reason to fear Steve, and Steve would have no reason to be suspicious of Darren. Their friendship would resume its natural course and, although I was sure they'd talk often about their trip to the Cirque Du Freak, Darren wouldn't go back to steal the spider, and Steve would never reveal the truth about Mr Crepsley.</p><p>I retreated from the entrance and climbed the steps up to the balcony. There, I watched as Steve had his showdown with Mr Crepsley. He asked to be the vampire's assistant. Mr Crepsley tested his blood, then rejected him on the grounds that he was evil. Steve left in a rage, swearing revenge on the vampire.</p><p>Would Steve still seek out that revenge now that his main nemesis - me - had been removed from the equation? When he grew up, would his path still take him away from normal life and towards the vampaneze? Was he destined to live his life as he had the first time round, only with a different enemy instead of Darren Shan? Or would the universe replace Steve, like me, with somebody else?</p><p>I had no way of knowing. Only time would tell, and I wouldn't be around long enough to see the story through to its end. I'd had my innings, and they were just about over. It was time for me to step back, draw a line under my life, and make my final farewell.</p><p>But first - one last cunning attempt to wreck the plans of Desmond Tiny!</p><p>Chapter NINETEEN</p><p>The key events of the past can't be changed, but the people in it can. Evanna had told me that if she went back and killed Adolf Hitler, the universe would replace him with somebody else. The major events of World War II would unfold exactly as they were meant to, only with a different figurehead at the helm. This would obviously create a number of temporal discrepancies, but nothing the higher force of the universe couldn't set right.</p><p>While I couldn't alter the course of my history, I could remove myself from it. Which was what I'd done by scaring off young Darren. The events of my life would unravel the same way they had before. A child would be blooded, travel to Vampire Mountain, unmask Kurda Smahlt, become a Vampire Prince, then hunt for the Vampaneze Lord. But it wouldn't be the boy I'd frightened off tonight. Somebody else - some other child - would have to fill the shoes of Darren Shan.</p><p>I felt bad about putting another kid through the tough trials of my life, but at least I knew that in the end - in death - he would be triumphant. The person who replaced me would follow in my footsteps, kill the Vampaneze Lord and die in the battle, and out of that death peace would hopefully grow. Since the child wouldn't be responsible for his actions, his soul should go straight to Paradise when he died - the universe, I hoped, was harsh but fair.</p><p>And maybe it wouldn't even be a boy. Perhaps I'd be replaced by a girl! The new Darren Shan didn't have to be an exact replica of the old one. He or she could come from any background or country. All the child needed was a strong sense of curiosity and a slightly disobedient streak. Anyone with the nerve to sneak out late at night and go see the Cirque Du Freak had the potential to take my place as Mr Crepsley's assistant.</p><p>Since my part would change, the parts of others could change too. Maybe another girl - or boy - would fill Debbie's role, and somebody else could be Sam Grest. Perhaps Gavner Purl wouldn't be the vampire who was killed by Kurda, and even Steve could be replaced by another. Maybe Mr Crepsley wouldn't be the one to die in the Cavern of Retribution, and would live to be a vampire of ancient years and wisdom, like his mentor, Seba Nile. Many of the parts in the story - the saga - of my life might be up for grabs now that the central character had been changed.</p><p>But that was all wild speculation. What I did know for certain was that the boy I'd once been would now lead a normal life. He'd go to school, grow up like anybody else, get a job, maybe raise a family of his own one day. All the things the original Darren Shan had missed out on, the new Darren would enjoy. I'd given him his freedom - his humanity. I could only pray to the gods of the vampires that he made the most of it.</p><p>The objects stitched into the lining of my robes were my diaries. I'd kept a diary just about as long as I could remember. I'd recorded everything in it - my trip to the Cirque Du Freak, becoming Mr Crepsley's assistant, my time in Vampire Mountain, the War of the Scars and hunt for the Vampaneze Lord, right up to that final night when I'd had my fatal last run-in with Steve. It was all there, everything important from my life, along with lots of trivial stuff too.</p><p>Evanna had brought the diary up to date. She must have taken it from the house where Debbie and Alice were based, then described all that had happened on that blood-drenched night, the showdown with Steve and my death. She'd then briefly outlined my long years of mental suffering in the Lake of Souls, followed by a more detailed account of my rescue and rebirth as a Little Person. She'd even gone beyond that, and told what happened next, my return, the way I'd scared the original Darren away, and...</p><p>I don't know what she wrote in the last few pages. I didn't read that far. I'd rather find out for myself what my final actions and thoughts are - not read about them in a book!</p>","<p>After Steve left and Mr Crepsley retired to the cellar where his coffin was stored, I went in search of Mr Tall. I found him in his van, going over the night's receipts. He used to do that regularly. I think he enjoyed the normality of the simple task. I knocked on the door and waited for him to answer.</p><p>\"What do you want?\" he asked suspiciously when he saw me. Mr Tall wasn't used to being surprised, certainly not by a Little Person.</p><p>I held the diaries out to him. He looked at them warily, not touching them.</p><p>\"Is this a message from Desmond?\" he asked. I shook my neckless head. \"Then what...?\" His eyes widened. \"No!\" he gasped. \"It can't be!\" He pushed my hood back - I'd replaced it after I'd scared off the young me - and studied my features fiercely.</p><p>After a while Mr Tall's look of concern was replaced by a smile. \"Is this my sister's work?\" he enquired. I nodded my chunky head a fraction. \"I never thought she'd get involved,\" he murmured. \"I imagine there's more to it than just freeing your soul, but I won't press you for information - better for all concerned if I don't know.\"</p><p>I raised the diaries, wanting him to take them, but Mr Tall still didn't touch them. \"I'm not sure I understand,\" he said.</p><p>I pointed to the name - Darren Shan - scrawled across the front of the top copy, then to myself. Opening it, I let him see the date and the first few lines, then flicked forward to where it described my visit to the Cirque Du Freak and what had happened. When he'd read the part where I told about watching Steve from the balcony, I pointed up and shook my head hard.</p><p>\"Oh,\" Mr Tall chuckled. \"I see. Evanna not only saved your soul - she gave the old you his normal life back.\"</p><p>I smiled, pleased he finally understood. I closed the diary, tapped the cover, then offered the books to him again. This time he took them.</p><p>\"Your plan is clear to me now,\" he said softly. \"You want the world to know of this, but not yet. You are right - to reveal it now would be to risk unleashing the hounds of chaos. But if it's released later, around the time when you died, it could affect only the present and the future.\"</p><p>Mr Tall's hands moved very swiftly and the diaries disappeared. \"I will keep them safe until the time is right,\" he said. \"Then I will send them to... who? An author? A publisher? The person you have become?\"</p><p>I nodded quickly when he said that.</p><p>\"Very well,\" he said. \"I cannot say what he will do with these - he might consider them a hoax, or not understand what you want of him - but I'll do as you request.\" He started to close the door, then paused. \"In this time, of course, I do not know you, and now that you have removed yourself from your original timeline, I never shall. But I sense we were friends.\" He put out a hand and we shook. Mr Tall only very rarely shook hands. \"Good luck to you, friend,\" he whispered. \"Good luck to us all.\" Then he quickly broke contact and closed the door, leaving me to retire, find a nice quiet spot where I could be alone - and die.</p><p>I now know why Evanna commented on Mr Tiny not being a reader. He has nothing to do with books. He doesn't pay attention to novels or other works of fiction. If, many years from now, an adult Darren Shan comes along and publishes a series of books about vampires, Mr Tiny won't know about it. His attention will be focused elsewhere. The books will come out and be read, and even though vampires aren't avid readers, word will surely trickle back to them.</p><p>As the War of the Scars comes to a wary pause and leaders on both sides try to forge a new era of peace, my diaries will - with the luck of the vampires - hit book shops around the world. Vampires and vampaneze will be able to read my story (or have it read to them if they're illiterate). They'll discover more about Mr Tiny than they ever imagined. They'll see precisely how much of a meddler he really is, and learn of his plans for a desolate future world. Armed with that knowledge, and united by the birth of Evanna's children, I'm certain they'll band together and do all they can to stop him.</p><p>Mr Tall will send my diaries to the grown Darren Shan. I don't imagine he'll add any notes or instructions of his own - he dare not meddle with the past in that way. It's possible the adult me will dismiss the diaries, write them off as a bizarre con job, and do nothing with them. But knowing me the way I do (now that sounds weird!), I think, once he's read them, he'll take them at face value. I like to believe I always had an open mind.</p><p>If the adult me reads the diaries all the way to the end, and believes they're real, he'll know what to do. Rewrite them, fiddle with the names so as not to draw unwelcome attention to the real people involved, rework the facts into a story, cut out the duller entries, fictionalize it a bit, create an action-packed adventure. And then, when he's done all that - sell it! Find an agent and publisher. Pretend it's a work of fantasy. Get it published. Promote it hard. Sell it to as many countries as he can, to spread the word and increase the chances of the story capturing the attention of vampires and vampaneze.</p><p>Am I being realistic? There's a big difference between a diary and a novel. Will the human Darren Shan have the ability to draw readers in and spin a tale which keeps them hooked? Will he be able to write a series of novels strong enough to attract the attention of the children of the night? I don't know. I was pretty good at writing stories when I was younger, but there's no way of knowing what I'll be like when I grow up. Maybe I won't read any more. Maybe I won't want to or be able to write.</p><p>But I've got to hope for the best. Freed from his dark destiny, I've got to hope the young me keeps on reading and writing. If the luck of the vampires is really with me (with us) maybe that Darren will become a writer even before Mr Tall sends the package to him. That would be perfect, if he was already an author. He could put the story of my life out as just another of his imaginative works, then get on with writing his own stuff, and nobody - except those actually involved in the War of the Scars - would ever know the difference.</p><p>Maybe I'm just dreaming. But it could happen. I'm proof that stranger things have taken place. So I say: Go for it, Darren! Follow your dreams. Take your ideas and run with them. Work hard. Learn to write well. I'll be waiting for you up ahead if you do, with the weirdest, twistiest story you've ever heard. Words have the power to alter the future and change the world. I think, together, we can find the right words. I can even, now that I think about it, suggest a first line for the book, to start you out on the long and winding road, perhaps something along the lines of, \"I've always been fascinated by spiders...\"</p>","<p>Chapter TWENTY</p><p>I'm on the roof of the old cinema, lying on my back, studying the beautiful sky. Dawn is close. Thin clouds drift slowly across the lightening horizon. I can feel myself coming undone. It won't be much longer now.</p><p>I'm not one hundred per cent sure how Mr Tiny's resurrection process works, but I think I understand enough of it to know what's going on. Harkat was created from the remains of Kurda Smahlt. Mr Tiny took Kurda's corpse and used it to create a Little Person. He then returned Harkat to the past. Harkat and Kurda shouldn't have been able to exist simultaneously. A soul can't normally share two bodies at the same time. One should have given way for the other. As the original, Kurda had the automatic right to life, so Harkat's body should have started to unravel, as it did when Kurda was fished out of the Lake of Souls all those years later.</p><p>But it didn't. Harkat survived for several years in the same time zone as Kurda. That makes me assume that Mr Tiny has the power to protect his Little People, at least for a while, even if he sends them back to a time when their original forms are still alive.</p><p>But he didn't bother to protect me when he sent me back. So one of the bodies has to go - this one. But I'm not moaning. I'm OK with my brief spell as a Little Person. In fact, the shortness of this life is the whole point! It's how Evanna has freed me.</p><p>When Kurda was facing death for the second time, Mr Tiny told him that his spirit wouldn't return to the Lake - it would depart this realm. By dying now, my soul - like Kurda's - will fly immediately to Paradise. I suppose it's a bit like not passing \"Go\" on a Monopoly board and going straight to jail, except in this case \"Go\" is the Lake of Souls and \"jail\" is the afterlife.</p><p>I feel exceptionally light, as though I weigh almost nothing. The sensation is increasing by the moment. My body's fading away, dissolving. But not like in the green pool of liquid in Mr Tiny's cave. This is a gentle, painless dissolve, as though some great force is unstitching me, using a pair of magical knitting needles to pick my flesh and bones apart, strand by strand, knot by knot.</p><p>What will Paradise be like? I can't answer that one. I can't even hazard a guess. I imagine it's a timeless place, where the dead souls of every age mingle as one, renewing old friendships and making new acquaintances. Space doesn't exist, not even bodies, just thoughts and imagination. But I have no proof of that. It's just what I picture it to be.</p><p>I summon what little energy I have left and raise a hand. I can see through the grey flesh now, through the muscles and bones, to the twinkle of the stars beyond. I smile and the corners of my lips continue stretching, off my face, becoming a limitless, endless smile.</p><p>My robes sag as the body beneath loses the ability to support them. Atoms rise from me like steam, thin tendrils at first, then a steady stream of shafts which are all the colours of the rainbow, my soul departing from every area of my body at once. The tendrils wrap around one another and shoot upwards, bound for the stars and realms beyond.</p><p>There's almost nothing left of me now. The robes collapse in on themselves completely. The last traces of my spirit hover above the robes and the roof. I think of my family, Debbie, Mr Crepsley, Steve, Mr Tiny, all those I've known, loved, feared and hated. My last thought, oddly, is of Madam Octa - I wonder if they have spiders in Paradise?</p><p>And now it's over. I'm finished with this world. My final few atoms rise at a speed faster than light, leaving the roof, the theatre, the town, the world, far, far behind. I'm heading for a new universe, new adventures, a new way of being. Farewell world! Goodbye Darren Shan! So long old friends and allies! This is it! The stars draw me towards them. Explosions of space and time. Breaking through the barriers of the old reality. Coming apart, coming together, moving on. A breath on the lips of the universe. All things, all worlds, all lives. Everything at once and never. Mr Crepsley waiting. Laughter in the great beyond. I'm going... I'm... going... I'm... gone.</p>"]}]}
